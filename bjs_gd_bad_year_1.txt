-they're trying to lower costs as much as possible so you run out of all the supplies you need all the time No teamwork, management was unorganized, Managers got very personal and definitely had their favorites, unfair, lots of fights between management back of house and servers Typical restaurant downfalls, inconsistent pay, unpredictable schedule, uneven work load. *If you work a Lunch shift you get horrible hours (about 3-5), but if you work a dinner you get (6+ hours) Instead of making them equal people in the morning get screwed over. *Lack of Good Training. Hostile work environment, bad tippers due to this particular location being a part of an outdoor mall, Bad Management, Awful scheduling (coworkers often being scheduled double shifts without break time) Constant turnover (people would put in their two weeks after only working a week due to the lack of money being made) heavy focus on pitching food items and corporate interference. Management is all over the place, forced to work overtime if your replacement is there on time Angry customers, but you'll get that anywhere No tips, very limited advancement, low pay, irregular hours Long ticket times for food and mistakes in the kitchen Work life balance was low Dealing with the public is not easy. Overwhelming expectations, absolutely no work-life balance Fast-paced (if you do not like fast environments things can get out of control for you), management can be either really good or extremely poor, customers can be mean and unnecessary, some people do not know how to serve, cooks can be terrible Tip out is too high to buskers, bartenders camp; food runners.
