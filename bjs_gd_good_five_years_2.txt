-Great balance between work life and personal life Honestly I can't think of one positive thing to say Corporate company with a good product, takes care of those they move into key positions 2 years ago I worked here and really enjoyed it with good management and colleagues, but I can't say the same anymore Great opportunity to move up free food. Flexible scheduling was nice to have it is a good work It's a serving job so you will almost always leave with some money in your pocket and the people that work there are often really nice and cool to be around. Good training for high volume serving. Many locations to transfer to The people you work with are awesome, every once in a while you get a gem of a manager to work with, which makes days or nights so much better. As a bus boy you get a cut of the tips for your shift, depending on how busy it is they can really add up. Very easy job. Al you have to do is smile have a good attitude which are good fundamentals but if you want to eventually serve I would say start off as food runner.you get to learn the meals and get use to the fast paste atmosphere. Learned how to work a cash register, how to communicate efficiently with guests, how to work with a sense of urgency and be on my toes, learned to multitask, worked with my school schedule well and always gave me time off when I needed it (for the most part).
