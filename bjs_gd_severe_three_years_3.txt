They give you a really hard time if you have to call out for a shift, they don't really care if you're sick or have personal things going on they just want a body to fill the position whether you're in a good position to work or not. So to have a crappy management team that is unfair to team members and does not value or treat their team members like human beings makes it a little hard to want to work for that place. Managers at this store were horrible work conditions unsafe I fell and they laughed and joked about it still have problem moving arm 3 Years ago Low quality food, mediocre management, cheap clientele All the service managers left a lot to be desired. Management, “teamwork” kitchen staff was awful crap pay, crap hours, crap management Because it is a big corporation there are a lot of problems, bad management, bad servers Its really under payed they expect too much for what they pay. Another former employee resigned and gave her a letter of resignation and the general manager posted it on the wall and made fun of it to every other employee.
