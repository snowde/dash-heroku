Now that I work there I understand why every chipotle dining room is so trashed all the time. Dirty tables and filthy bathrooms are a constant in every Chipotle anywhere. Now I understand why. It is because while the rest of the people on the line are only responsible for one task, the cashier is responsible for half of the responsibilities of the restaurant and he/she is not allowed to get help with such duties from any other worker (like zero common sense teamwork ). Besides having the regular responsibilities of a cashier, this position requires that you keep each table and counter clean in the dining room, also the bathrooms and floors, also wipe and stock trays, constantly stocking and restocking the dining room, ask customers if everything is great all that while having an endless line of people. Yes, I get the multitasking concept but it doesn't make any sense to put all these responsibilities on a one person while the rest of the employees on the line have one task only. Now I see why all Chipotles dining rooms and bathrooms are always so filthy while I see people just chilling on the line and while the cashier is always so busy and unable to complete the overload of expected duties. And yeap they all get paid the same.","I know you are a corporation and your system comes from above. But maybe it is time to take a look at your system because as a customer before I worked at Chipotle, my family and I would always be disgusted to have to eat on top of beans, rice and salsa spilled on dirty counters and tables, and we would never dare to use your always filthy bathrooms. Understand it doesn't make any sense to put so much responsibility on the cashier while the expo doesn't do much, and while there is so much need to keep the dining room and bathrooms clean and restocked. I don't know how this corporation and its managers so blindly follow this pointless system and no one dares to speak up. Or is it that every manager is so out of touch not to realize how messed up is to run a restaurant with always filthy dining room and bathrooms?? And how it just doesn't make any sense to expect the cashier to efficiently do all their tasks while others are not expected to do much and are not even allowed to help??

I was hired at Chipotle by the GM (at that time, she eventually was fired because a bitter former employee told corporate that she was making people work off the clock). Once she was fired, the apprentice was moved up to the GM position when they were NOT ready, instead of Chipotle finding someone qualified to take the position. The apprentice at the time was only apprentice for a few months, and although they had worked their way up from Crew, they still had a lot to learn about managing people. Once this person took the GM position, things went left.<br><br>I can only REALLY speak on experiences from my store, but it is my understanding that MOST Chipotle's in college towns don't give a crap when you have class, or another job, or really any other responsibilities. If they put you on schedule, even if it was their mistake and you aren't available, it is your problem. If you requested off 4-5 weeks in advance and they accidentally schedule you- oop! Oh well! Better find someone to cover or you're in trouble! Also... they do not care how many hours you request to work. If you're a student be VERY specific about how many hours you want, and even then there's no guarantee that will be respected.<br><br>There's no telling when you'll get breaks, especially if the store's busy. There are times where no one went on break until the store literally closed, and by that time you just want to hurry up and finish your work so you can get the hell out of there! That's a 9-10 hour shift with no food or break. If you're on a ""short shift"" such as 4-9:30 you better believe you're not getting a break even if the law says you're supposed to after 5 hours of work.<br><br>Also, no matter what shift you're scheduled for (7:30am-3:30pm or 3:30pm-11:30pm) you're NOT getting off when the schedule says you will. So, if you're the type of person that can't handle working all night then getting up early for class, DON'T close.<br><br>In my opinion, Chipotle asks way too much of employees, and management treats these employees very poorly. Even though the pay is over minimum wage, and personally I received a raise even above that, I didn't feel it was worth the things I was put through by management. There's a tuition reimbursement program that offers up to $5200 every year that you work if you're enrolled in school. I kept pestering my managers about this when finally one day they told me I missed the ""deadline"" that I'd been asking about for weeks... I was miserable. $5000 extra for a college student is like winning the lottery... or really for anyone having that extra money would be extremely nice. When I finally decided to quit, I was told I'm ""dumb"" for going to college because I will be in debt anyways. I was also told by my GM and another manager that they ""make more money in a year than I ever will with my degree"" - LOL. Considering they spend 60-70 hours a week rolling burritos I'm pretty sure my salary will be nicer and require a lot less crappy work. Chipotle needs to not turn the other cheek anymore with all the complaints employees put out about management...there are countless reviews just like this one, so please don't take this as a bitter ex employee review. I loved working at Chipotle because of my coworkers despite the crap we went through, but after losing out on 5 grand because my managers were angry towards students for no reason I decided I had to leave for my sanity."

I usually work from 10:15-5pm The slowest time of the day is around 3:30. We get about 3-10 customers around that time, therefore I attempt to take a break. I always ask my manager at around 4 for a break but she always says no. I have to clean the lobby first and refill the ice again and then i can eat.

I always get off late. I'm not talking 15 mins or 30 mins an HOUR someties close to two hours. My manager takes forever to count my drawer and to put in the other drawer for the next cashier.

"""Honestly--it all depends.""",3.0," Sep 26, 2016",Past,Tortilla I,"Fremont, CA",No,No,Neutral,Full-time,Less than a year,"I worked at Chipotle for almost 4 months. Started in June of 2016, quit a couple months later in September. I'm going to try my best and layout the entire experience for you.<br><br>When you first get there, you'll be either interviewed once or twice, perhaps with other people. I was interviewed once and talked to three different managers and was hired on the spot. (This is my first job) I came in a few days later for my orientation and basically shook a few hands of the other team members and then spent my few first days sitting in the small cramped closet they called an office watching training videos.<br><br>I guess it depends on your experience or it might even be the manager's choice to find the perfect position for you. You're really either on the line making orders, switching foods out, and taking people's crap or you're in the kitchen taken the people on the line's crap. I was given the position of being on the line. I was mainly Tortilla 1 (the person who starts your order). The videos didn't help- me as much as my co-workers did. That's kind've what they do. At least at Chipotle, it's your job's job to make you feel comfortable to work at such a great speed. They want you to do better and they SHOULD correct you and help you rather than discipline you. This is where my review title kicks in. It honestly, all depends.<br><br>Not only does it depend on your employees and how you interact, it also depends on you and your energy/motivation to get you through the day. It also depends on your managers and your relationship with them.<br><br>You see, it was my first job. I didn't know many people--a lot of my co-workers had already known each other so being the new one was equivalent of being the irrelevant one.<br><br>The actual job itself depends too. On where you're located. If you want more of a laidback job---and somehow still want to work Chipotle, I'd recommend finding an area in which that Chipotle is not so busy. That way, you're dealing with too many crappy people in a single filed line heading out the door like my job did.<br><br>The training is kind of bad at this job. Your co-workers basically train you by telling you what you should be doing and how you should do it. If they don't and you're confused, you should seriously speak up and ask.<br><br>The customers at Chipotle can either be super simple or super complex. For example, I had a customer that came in and each time, he would order a double-wrapped burrito with two scoops of both rices, two scoops of both beans, fajitas, sofritas, and every salsa. Yeah, thank god the training was so bad that I didn't have to worry about doing his salsa (there's another person for salsa) and rolling his burrito.<br><br>Not only is each customer a surprise (but, when aren't they?), your managers are going to be watching you. They'll be taking into account of how well your work, how fast you're working (and trust me, you'll learn to get fast the sooner you learn how to do everything so ASK if you need help.), and how well your attitude is. Trust me, customers WILL complain.<br><br>Anyway, not only do you have to keep a smiley face on with a good pace going, but you have to also touch the hot food and tables and tortillas. Yeah nobody mentions how HOT everything is and how easy it is to burn yourself here. You get used to it. Yep, there's no other way around it. Sometimes, you'll have days when you are going as fast as you can and there'll still be a line. You'll eventually come across a customer with 6 complicated orders. Oh and maybe another customer who needs you to change your gloves because they're vegetarian. Then your manager will tell you to hurry it up but you have a customer who doesn't know what they want or has never been there. You have to keep your stress levels down during busy hours.<br><br>When it's not busy, you'll probably be making foils which was my favorite task tbh, or making kids meals or taco shell baskets, etc. I rarely got to do dishes but I thought dishes were fun. You get pretty wet tho no lie it's kinda gross.<br><br>This job was great. I just hated my managers. They were SUCH hypocrites. They would tell me I can clock in a few minutes early and then once I did they'd yell at me and tell me that it's not allowed. Sometimes they would call me 10 minutes before my shift starts asking me where I am and that I need to call 15 minutes ahead if I'm going to be late. Yeah. They're clingy. I got written up for that once. I clocked in 1 minute after my shift and didn't call 15 minutes ahead. I was right around the corner. She said my lateness throws everyone else off because it can get busy. I got there and only 2 people were in line and one was already paying. Yeah.<br><br>The breaks tho are amazing. You always get a 10 minute break. I worked part time from 11:00-3 or 11:30-4:30. (I made 11.25 an hour) Sometimes I worked a full shift. (when you work full shift you get a share of the tips. I made like $2 in change somtimes) I started getting a lot of full shifts up until I quit. The longer shifts for me were 11:45-7PM. Still, I always got a ten minute break. On those tens, you can go to cash and grab a receipt paper. You write want you want to eat, give it to someone on the line and wait for them to make it. I never had Chipotle until I worked there. I like the barbacoa tacos. Just gotta drown them in lemon juice bc the corn tortillas are dry. I also like the kid's size barbacoa quesadilla. Always get a bag of chips and a fountain drink. The drinks behind the glass like the Izzies and chocolate milk are not free. They're like 50% off tho. When you work full shifts you get a 20, and a 30 minute break I think. I know you get two longer breaks. You can get a free meal during your 30 too. When you're not working, you get a 50% discount but only on one item. So let's say you go with your family or friends and you want to use your discount. You don't get the 50% off on the whole order. just on YOUR meal. Yeah, it's not all that great.","Anyway, if you don't get along with your co-workers or managers, it's not going to be a very nice environment. if you live in a nice neighborhood with a low crime rate and everything, you'll be good. Hopefully you don't have picky customers. If you want the job, google the chipotle 13 characteristics and memorize them. Mention in the interview that you have them or most of them. Trust me. You'll be at the top of their list. Know the vision. Not only the ""change the way people think and eat fast food"" or whatever but the only one too. There's legit a quizlet somewhere about Chipotle questions so google that and you'll be okay. Act very happy.<br><br>And also I'll mention that the music in Chipotle will get annoying. Some of it's good. They have two Broken Bells songs I mean like Holding On For Life, yo. So good. But anyway, the music is on repeat. You'll get a song stuck in your head if you get the chance to hear it playing. They play Sandman A LOT. Good luck people!",Build up the confidence in your employees.

The job itself at any level is not difficult. I do not regret anything about my time here but I'm very glad I left when I did. The customers are upstanding citizens for the most part and the days go by very quickly. Salaried managers receive great benefits like stock options, company cars, and frequent paid business trips. Hourly level employees have a chance to make a career if they're willing to fully devote themselves to Chipotle.","Company is going downhill and fast. As a Restaurateur 2 (GM of my own restaurant while also mentoring a GM I developed), I was operating as a TL while my TL was on sabbatical with no extra pay. The company does not care about Restaurateur cultures or how restaurant level employees feel anymore and are only focus on micromanaging meticulous food safety practices that take away from the guest and crew experience. For some reason they're trying to double in size and open new restaurant concepts while also instructing their Restaurateurs to terminate solid veteran managers because they ""haven't adapted quickly"" to the companies new priorities. You will see a lot of illegal practices like Salaried Managers being told to make hourly employees work off the clock and edit time punches so nobody gets overtime, 80 hour work weeks for salaried managers because we're told not to fully staff our restaurants. The company was great and was focused on the right thing before the foodbourne illness outbreaks but now the company has changed for the worse. It will just be a regular fast food restaurant eventually because they will always prioritize strict constantly changing food procedures over taking care of employees.",Get your priorities in order and go back to the start like you've always preached. Caring about human beings is what made Chipotle great.. Not strict assembly line like procedures and protocols. The company does not need to grow in restaurant count or make burger joints or change the way we cut a bell pepper. The company needs to listen to how restaurant level employees feel and ensure that Field Leaders are leading and not micromanaging and forcing their Salaried Managers to do illegal things.

Just because you are intelligent does not mean you are a leader, especially if you are not going to make any strides to connect and understand your people. They say people are not a ""culture fit"" if they disagree or don't respond well to negativity or power. None of them realize that most corporate employees hate their jobs and are too scared to speak up. Being smart and hard working does not work here if you have your own opinions or a different way of doing things. I am sure Chipotle used to be great but everyone who disagreed either got pushed out or let go. This company says they want people to come as they are, but if you are outgoing and a people person you are deemed a low performer. The one on one culture is really just a gossip culture, and managers get each other riled up about people they don't even know or work with. All in all, very very very dissapointed with this supposedly cool company.","Take a step back and think about why you have such high turnover. Saying ""this is an intense place"" isn't good enough. How is this approach working? No one is happy other than the people who somehow made it to the top. It's going to be surprising when everyone leaves but it shouldn't be.

Sometimes (not always) your hard-work wasn't valued, which is understandable at a point because there was no time to be congratulating people for a job well done. If you are good at a position (say cash, which I hated) then you best believe thats going to be your position til you quit because they have no intention to train someone else (unless you like repetitiveness then its a pro for you). I worked at their busiest location (Jackson) and even though it wasn't necessarily a bad thing, it is EXTREMELY busy, which was very tiring, to be standing in one spot for about 3-4 hours until the line died down.

The management is the worst I have ever had to deal with. Management needs to do their job properly without breaking labor laws! More people need to be hired, as we are regularly understaffed and it is impossible to get someone to cover work for a day simply because there are no people able to cover a shift. Training needs to be done more frequently, there needs to be less people who only know how to do one job, and more people who are able to do most things in the store - this opens up more people to be able to cover for breaks or to cover for shifts when people are sick or need a personal day."

They also have very unrealistic expectations for what needs to be done and the time frame by which it must be completed. I also saw a lot of racism. During my time there, 4 people were fired. All 4 were people of color. All of the management was white, even though there was a Latina lady there who had more experience than the general manager. Finally, I am still crazy puzzled by the fact that there were three interviews for such a shi tty job. Like, you realize this is a fast food place, right? You need bodies.

I also learned some very useful kitchen skills such as food safety, proper knife handling and care, cutting various types of food. A vast knowledge of the menu and food, allergens and the sustainable practices will be very helpful when on the line and dealing with customers.","My first and foremost complaint is the lack of recognition of real skill and desire to advance- upon hire I was promised these opportunities (""you could make kitchen manager in six months, if you try hard enough-"" and boy did I try, in vain!...) Priority to train and promote someone hired at the same time as me was placed above my own advancement, possibly because they had more kitchen experience than I did (but in my interview, I was told that prerequisite skill, education and job history would not be a determining factor in my success... this was obviously not the case.) Management can be conflicting and, at times, very hypocritical; it is hard to finish a task when two people are telling you to do two very different things. There was definitely some favoritism in the management and crew as well and this would cause resentment among and crew and create a negative atmosphere. Even the district manager had, at most, 2 meetings with me during my lengthy 5+ months of employment, and those were in my first month or two, only. There is never a dull moment at Chipotle, unless you're in throughput and there is no one in line- in which case you are literally just standing around, waiting to serve food. Often times those who are great at customer service end up stuck in the front of the house, sweating as they work feverishly on the line scooping rice and beans, and burning their hands on tortillas, while those with seniority are given the freedom to roam the kitchen looking for odd tasks, or take their time cutting bell peppers. The amount of work you do, even considering the generous increase in starting wage compared to minimum wage, is simply not worth it. I had no free time, I was called in on almost all of my days off and usually felt too guilty not to come in- I ended up constantly picking up the slack of low performers, staying to help when I didn't need to, and busting my behind for a company that, when given the opportunity to promote me, gave the opportunity to someone else, equally or less deserving, and never even considered me.","Focus more on the people, and on the culture. Do not underestimate the stresses of the front line- dealing with customers face to face and constantly calling for food to a grill cook who, more likely than not, can either not hear you or doesn't respond, can get as stressful as something like running grill... Reward your top performers for their effort and acknowledge their support, or they will turn on you and get tired of it, as I did. Reprimand low performers and make their insubordination a real priority, rather than pushing others to pick up their slack and treating the situation lightly, or they will continue to tread all over the crew! And finally, I reiterate, THE FRONT LINE IS KEY. I cannot even count the number of customer complaints that *I* had gotten when on the line by myself, doing everything I could to maintain my sense of urgency and quality, when others refused to hop on the line to help, even though these things were not *my* fault! Incentives like 'employee of the month,' 'best customer service,' 'top performer' awards and more might be a good starting place to actually motivate your crew members to be successful and employ some of their hidden 13 characteristics... and don't forget that as a manager it's YOUR job to EMPOWER your crew!"

In my restaurant, I was working with a lot of hurt people who spent their energies hurting others, like the people on many daytime TV programs.<br>The Expectations - The company expected people to move faster than human beings normally move, and this caused stress in the restaurant and harmed the customer experience. I don't like sweaty, obviously hurried people cooking and making my food, and that was the unfortunate reality at the restaurant I worked at far too often.<br>The Rio Grande Gap - The English-speaking managers talked badly about the Spanish-speaking workers; and the reverse was true.

It's pretty much the worst job I've ever had.,"So, some advice for upper management. Let me, first, guide you through a story about how your general managers behave within your company.<br>My hiring manager was very nice, as well as professional. I got the job after two interviews, my first with two lower-level managers, and my second with one of your kitchen managers. My first question when I interviewed at Chipotle was: wait... how many managers does this place even have? Why does it take so many managers to run this store when there are only about twenty employees?<br>The answer, my friends, is because they are all completely immature, rude, and selfish.<br>It took Chipotle four weeks to put me on the schedule once they told me I got the job. I had to call in every week to see if I was written in yet, only to be told to call back the next week. Four times.<br>Once I got to my orientation, it wasn't bad at all. I went through about an hour of one-on-one with my hiring manager reading through the employee hiring handbook, talking an awful lot about hard work, how different they were as a restaurant, the restaurant's goals of becoming restauranteur (an okay idea, at best), and empowerment. They were BIG on empowerment. I think I heard that word more in four hours of orientation than I did in my entire life beforehand. They insisted the company empowers people, and that you will love your work, and the people you work with.<br>You won't.<br>Halfway through my orientation, I noticed a lot of people were whispering around, even coming into the clearly occupied office where I was watching my videos to gossip, only to turned around once they realized I was in the room. It was strange, to say in the least, but I figured it wasn't my business, whatever it was, and continued watching my orientation videos.<br>About an hour later, my hiring manager comes in to tell me exactly what is going on. Allegedly, my general manager (who I hadn't even met yet) slept with a crew member of another Chipotle during a party (apparently Chipotle stores get together and having raging, drug and alcohol fueled parties...). My general manager's boyfriend is a manager of another nearby Chipotle. Supposedly, they broke up because THEIR MUTUAL BOSS told her boyfriend about her activities during the party. My hiring manager confided in me and I told her I wouldn't tell anyone. This kind of high school drama didn't even wait for my first day. This happened within four hours of my orientation. When I was finished with my videos and ready to leave, I couldn't, because my hiring and general managers were out back smoking and talking on phones and crying and fussing up a complete storm. I had to wait an extra hour (getting paid to do nothing) just to leave my orientation. Easy free money, sure, but it didn't scream professionalism by any means.<br>As for my first and only week working for them, I was told I would be trained my first five days, and then I would be on my own, and should know everything. I was trained for one day by a very overly enthusiastic older woman. I was trained to make chips. I did that for the entire seven hours of my shift, with a small one to two hour window when I worked line and made food for our customers. My first day was tiring, but it wasn't awful.<br>However, as the week progressed, it got worse. I was not trained formally by anyone. ANYONE. Not a single person took time out of their day to help train me on things they didn't think I was up to standard on. I worked all morning shifts, getting to the store at eight AM. Between 8 in the morning and 11, there are three hours during which any single person at Chipotle could have trained me and still gotten their work done for lunch rush. No one did.<br>Anytime something was wrong, or if I wasn't doing something correctly, my coworkers felt the need to ""empower"" me (translated: yell at me) during the worst possible times, such as in the middle of lunch rush when I was trying to fill orders, or when I was trying to learn something on my own. Not a single manager trained me. Out of six. One cut the limes I needed for chips one day. That was one of the only nice gestures I experienced.<br>Anytime I responded to criticism in anyway, I was told to ""not be so defensive"". This included just saying, ""ah, I know. Sorry about that, it was stupid of me,"" when I had realized my own mistake just seconds before someone else mentioned it.<br>The drama with my general manager continued during the entire week. I was approached often by coworkers, who told me to stop talking and work faster because I was trying to have light conversation and get to know the people I was working with. However, it was totally acceptable for my general manager, who gets salary by the way, to answer personal phone calls on the company phone and chain smoke in the back all day, as long as she pleased. It was also okay for her to talk and whine about her relationship to everyone and anyone that would listen in the kitchen prep area in the back of the restaurant. Everyone was free to take time to listen to her, but no one took three seconds out of their day to make me feel welcome except for two extremely sweet guys. Naturally, once those guys found out that I am currently engaged, they also stopped eating on break with me, as well as talking to me during shift at all. It was like working for a bunch of high schoolers. Not one single employee was capable and mature.<br>So, there you have it. The one week I worked at Chipotle. I wish it would have gone better. I did not anticipate it to be as bad as it was at all. I was genuinely shocked, and it was the first job I've ever had that I wanted to quit. I didn't even put in a two weeks. I can honestly say this place was the worst job I've ever had (and I've worked at Salvation Army!)."

That mantra is a way to dodge commitment to less-favored crew members and nothing more.<br><br>I switched restaurants about halfway through my 20 months with the company, and from then on I was stuck in limbo.

I received little to no criticism on my work (in fact, only shallow praise) but apparently I still wasn't good enough. Nepotism can take hold very quickly in the high-stress environment of a restaurant, and unfortunately I have to conclude that's what happened to me. I saw less-qualified, less-committed crew members actively chosen (and ""chosen"" was a word my managers used, not me) for management development, even while I was brushed off with the patronizing idea that it was all up to me. In the end, I kept my mouth shut and just kept working for my $9/hr - an insulting wage for the hard work that crew members do.","In-store managers: Keep your promises. Communicate. If your crew wants to learn something new or try for a manager position, be frank with them about their prospects, and keep them updated. I would've been happier if my managers had simply told me I wasn't the right fit for their crew - but I assume they preferred to keep me around because I worked hard even when I was being exploited.<br><br>Corporate/high-level management: If you visit the same restaurant for multiple audits, and every single time the GM has failed to keep a promise to you, or failed to fix a known issue, you should realize that that's probably a sign of deeper dysfunction. If everybody is on their best behavior for you and you still see fundamental issues with the crew dynamic and their work ethic, realize that you're being lied to about the state of things. And, most importantly, listen to the crew. Talk to them alone, WITHOUT their managers present, and they might get the chance to tell you how they really feel.

"""Great opportunities for the right type of person""",4.0," Jan 29, 2014",Current,Crew Member,"Marlborough, MA",Yes,Yes,Yes,Full-time,More than 3 years,"The ethics of the company are great. They care greatly about the sources of their ingredients, as well as the quality of food. Definitely the cleanest restaurant I have ever worked at ( I have also filled in at 3 additional locations aside from the Marlborough one, so I can vouch for them as well). The culture is very laid-back and liberal, which is a great fit for like-minded people, but may be awkward if you are not. As long as the company is growing, there are excellent opportunities for advancement from workers who are consistent, who ""fit in"" with the culture, and who express desire to make a career out of it.","The sales have been increasing rapidly for quite some time, so doing much of the preparation by hand using ""traditional culinary methods"" becomes tiresome and difficult if left to the same position every day. Front of house is much easier than back of house as far as workload goes, but it involves customer service, which some may not prefer. Also, the culture tends to favor ""cool"" people, who tend to get promoted if they are extroverted and likeable, regardless of qualifications. Although most of the managers are very easygoing and approachable, some may not perform their jobs very well, and may result in you having stressful shifts when they are in charge. There seems to be a high turnover rate amoingst less well-established restaurants with managers who end up going to college (after they graduate), and from other managers at said locations who are just incompetent that either quit or get fired. Also, there is a pay cut when promoted from Service Manager to Apprentice (it goes from hourly to salary, but the hours stay the same and the pay averages out to less - but even so, after a relatively short period as Apprentice, you are very likely to get promoted to Restaurant Manager, which is better in terms of pay, work, and benefits. After GM, the opportunities are excellent if promoted - including bonuses and opportunities with corporate (if you are interested in that).","Upper management should consider sales volume and team size more when evaluating the individual restaurants, and seek management based on business management capabilities rather than just their personality types. This would help the newer restaurants with regards to stability, and motivate a stable team of workers who are more likely to remain loyal and motivated to this company, which has great ethics and a promising future."

The enchilada maker was never unplugged early enough-the end result is that I had to clean dangerously hot equipment wearing LATEX gloves-which obviously made no sense because the gloves just melted and each night pieces of the skin from my hands would be seared off.<br>The front-line staff stand directly in front of the grill area and all the smoke and heat from the grill blasts the staff, it's worse than working outside in the summer in the desert.<br><br>Low wages: The minimum-wage/just about minimum that new employees are paid has been proven to create a permanent lower class dependent upon government programs. A full-time employee at Chipotle should not qualify for food stamps. Also, there were employees who needed more hours to pay their bills and were not giving more hours or an explanation while new hires were brought in. If that was management's way of passively-aggressively telling the person they were not valued than that is messed up. Managers should be honest and not play around with people's livelihoods.<br><br>Contradictory ""Standards"": I was constantly being yelled at about my food portioning. I was trained to put a certain amount of lime-cilantro rice in each burrito. (This amount I was supposed to visually memorize because there was no measurement. I was also told that customers were to have as much rice as they wanted. When I put what I was trained was the company standard amount of rice in the burrito the customers would yell at me that I was being stingy with the rice and that the other employees always put in more. When I would add more the cooks would yell at me that I was causing them to make more rice than they were use to and ""wasting"" rice. When I would add meat to a burrito there was a definite amount added and then any more required the customer to pay a bit extra...except when a customer complained that I did not give them ""enough"" by some unseen standard and then they were given more with no charge. When I tried to give the next customer the exact amount of meat I had observed from the previous customer, the staff complained that I was giving out too much meat.",I have no idea what advice to give. Before I worked for this company I was a loyal customer. After working for only 4 days and then quitting I have never eaten at a Chipotle since and basically boycott this entire company. My only advice would be: treat your employees well. They are human beings who have families and friends and could make or break your company in the long run.

I love the Chipotle and everything they stand for and I believe the opportunities are worth work if your the right person who can achieve it. Its a big company and you can expect politics to play a huge role in upper management, politics is destroying the passion that this company is trying to inspire.",There are many good people who want to be successful and are completely dedicated to the company. They believe in the company but don't feel that the company or upper management appreciates how hard they work. Eventually it leads to disillusionment and loss of motivation. At least believe in them too. Inspire them as you expect them to inspire future leaders of the company.
