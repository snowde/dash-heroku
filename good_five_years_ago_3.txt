Great way to move up in the company, fast paced, great way to learn new things, positive energy, good money If you love beer and an extensive menu in a fast paced environment bus is the place for you Can easily move up in company. Good training for high volume serving. Many locations to transfer to The people you work with are awesome, every once in a while you get a gem of a manager to work with, which makes days or nights so much better. As a bus boy you get a cut of the tips for your shift, depending on how busy it is they can really add up. Good pay, hours flexible, free meal on day you work and discount on off days Great music and atmosphere overall people are very nice Pretty good area money was good if you were on the floor A lot of people worked together, grew together and learned together. Very easy job. Al you have to do is smile have a good attitude which are good fundamentals but if you want to eventually serve I would say start off as food runner.you get to learn the meals and get use to the fast paste atmosphere. Learned how to work a cash register, how to communicate efficiently with guests, how to work with a sense of urgency and be on my toes, learned to multitask, worked with my school schedule well and always gave me time off when I needed it (for the most part).
