-Great balance between work life and personal life Honestly I can't think of one positive thing to say Corporate company with a good product, takes care of those they move into key positions 2 years ago I worked here and really enjoyed it with good management and colleagues, but I can't say the same anymore Great opportunity to move up free food. Tips were decent, food is good, employees were friendly Popular place, good for learning how to balance, execute, and function, in a fast paced environment. -Easy getting vacation (you just have to let them know a couple weeks in advance, or if it is a holiday such as Halloween you need to schedule it months in advance). . Flexible scheduling was nice to have it is a good work It's a serving job so you will almost always leave with some money in your pocket and the people that work there are often really nice and cool to be around. If you have seniority, you can be allowed to work FT (heard they only allow a certain number of people to have benefits)
