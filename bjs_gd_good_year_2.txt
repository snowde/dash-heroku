-Great balance between work life and personal life Honestly I can't think of one positive thing to say Corporate company with a good product, takes care of those they move into key positions 2 years ago I worked here and really enjoyed it with good management and colleagues, but I can't say the same anymore Great opportunity to move up free food. Flexible scheduling was nice to have it is a good work It's a serving job so you will almost always leave with some money in your pocket and the people that work there are often really nice and cool to be around. If you have seniority, you can be allowed to work FT (heard they only allow a certain number of people to have benefits) The money of pretty good The depth of beer education was phenomenal. Free food, always busy, food beer Good tips, challenging work place Good money can be made, opportunity for advancement and reward/recognition with green aprons and pins and bonuses a plus!. Flexible schedules, opportunities to advance High volume, fast paced, great food You can make really great money for the work compared to other restaurants. Can make your section turn and burn, or casual evening and still make money either way you like!
