-they're trying to lower costs as much as possible so you run out of all the supplies you need all the time No teamwork, management was unorganized, Managers got very personal and definitely had their favorites, unfair, lots of fights between management back of house and servers Typical restaurant downfalls, inconsistent pay, unpredictable schedule, uneven work load. Scheduling can lead to almost no rest period Working through the power hour doesn't feel worth it at times Depends on which location you work. Can be difficult depending on other coworkers Long hours no work life balance Money, Lack of silverware, lack of glassware, low on stock items, need more motivate people Management not always on top of things/great, no health benefits if part-time *There is not Employee Loyalty. *Management doesn't listen to you if you need to change your availability and will schedule you to work during time even though you cannot. *If you work a Lunch shift you get horrible hours (about 3-5), but if you work a dinner you get (6+ hours) Instead of making them equal people in the morning get screwed over. *Lack of Good Training.
