They give you a really hard time if you have to call out for a shift, they don't really care if you're sick or have personal things going on they just want a body to fill the position whether you're in a good position to work or not. The not so great guests The side work amount is insane, you will waste gas just to go to work to be cut after you set up in mornings, so opening and closing shifts as a food runner or server your screwed. Nobody is fair with the tip outs. Food runners shouldn't have to wait to get their tips, when their shift ends there should be a manager who correctly does the math based on the receipts for all the food run for their shift and tipped accordingly, because no waiter is going to tip a food runner the correct amount if they can just keep more money for themselves. Also, food runners going home with TIPS is the most ludicrous system i have ever heard of in 20years in the restaurant business. Once the trainers left, I figured out to my horror that I had to do twice the amount of work for my station than I was expecting to do (which was already a lot, more than one person can handle in a three hour time period before service). The cutting and breaking is terrible and chaotic, the managers get stressed too easily, the kitchen is really slow, and it just doesn't seem like anyone knows what they're doing and we, the servers, get blamed and tipped badly for it, and we're already getting bad tips because half the customers don't understand a good tip from a bad one.
