The POSI system is a Micros based software specific to BJ's. If you're coming from an Aloha background, prepare for frustration. And if you're coming from a Micros background, prepare for frustration. Luckily, there are little tricky ways around the most common hang ups (like you can't reprint or send orders after a check has been separated.) Find an experienced server, and ask them their tricks, because when you've got 6 tables one lunch or dinner, you're GOING to need them.. . (Answer: separate an extra ticket with ONLY a ""no bev"" on it, process the payment for that one needy has-to-leave-earlier or do-mine-now-anyway guest, close it out, and recombine. The extra no-bev ticket will prevent you from being locked out if you get down to only one ticket and they now want another drink, and having the option to recombine everything means you don't need a manager for every last order.). . It is SO HARD to serve at BJ's compared to other restaurants, and sometimes the money doesn't reflect how much extra work it is. Guest orders something with fries? Ketchup not on the table. You have to go get it. Unsweet tea but wants splenda? Sweetener not on the table. You have to go get it. Orders the tortilla soup? Doesn't come with a spoon because of the bowl it's served in. You have to drop it on the table before their soup comes out. These very common items suck up a LOT of time when you're triple sat and need to close out another check, and that guest needs ""more ray-anch."". . Every server is scheduled weekly for a food running shift. No exceptions. You get tipped out, but you get paid server wage. Most people dread it. It's a LOT of work, but a great food runner makes a much smoother shift. Lazy food runners can make it all crash and burn.

We're a sports bar and brewhouse shaped like a restaurant. We used to have black shirts. By the end of the shift with the white shirts, I look like a SLOB. Because of the number of extra trips we have to make at this restaurant, consolidation is key, so when I stack plates from my belly button to my nose to haul them back to dish, I end up with spots of food all over me.. and there's no getting rid of it until I get home. EVERYONE leaves looking like they rolled around on the kitchen floor. Spill tea on yourself? Instand wet t-shirt contest. Girls come in in a non-neutral underclothes color? sent home. (granted, that would be THEIR fault. Sillies.) Any wrinkle? Magnified. This shirt issue is the worst part of my job, I honestly feel. Also, I wear little boy size large because white, button down shirts for women are 20-30 bucks plus. And I refuse to spill food on a shirt that nice shirt.

Also, any complaint from a guest is ALWAYS your fault. Management doesn't seem to understand that servers are human and can make simple mistakes. It's always the guest's word over yours. And that sucks. The reason I got fired was because I was in the weeds and I failed to fill up a guest's water. The man claimed I ""didn't want to wait on him"" when in reality I was overwhelmed with tables because the manager cut most of the servers (to save labor cost) and I couldn't keep up with all the tasks at hand. Of course, there was no one around to help me at that time. The white shirts you wear are a pain to keep clean as well. But a lot of restaurants have that uniform so no big deal.

Free meals if you like frozen food.","Bj's is in the business of chasing its stock value on a weekly basis. Changes come fast and not very smoothly. ""Buy one get one"" offers sent out with Sunday's paper and restaurants were informed of this that Sunday, staffing impossible. These are the kinds of things that happen on a weekly basis and makes trying to run a smoothly flowing restaurant almost impossible. No ownership of any areas of the business but this is really due to not having a realistic idea of what is expected of you. Worked over 12 quarters and went over 12 quarters without a mandatory quarterly performance review.. . Almost 3 years of employment never had a real manager meeting and the few times manager sat at the table at once could be counted on one hand. I can't really complain about the lack of meetings because each restaurant will being run with five managers if fully staffed. That's FOH and BOH, with restaurants being open as much as 14 hours a day there is no time to have a real manager meeting in less a couple people are coming in on their days off. If someone points the finger at you, you better point 2 fingers at people below you. As that is the business model they are using.. . They pay managers very well, but it was made clear that we are mercenaries. Not truly part of the team just, hired soldiers to implementing the marketing strategy that is only focused a few weeks out and always changes. The Bj's restaurants in the area that I was working and had absolutely no culture or any idea of how to create one. They treat the hourly employees like replaceable robots. Working at this place took years off my life far beyond the time spent there.. . My goal for every shift became just to survive the shift. I hated that feeling, even more that it felt like there was nothing I could do to try to start moving the restaurant forward.","My advice to managers is if you need a job Bj's pays well. But keep looking, don't make it obvious or they'll come down on you for not being loyal. Which is almost laughable because there is zero loyalty paid to its employees.. .

Most of the time it is easy to swap a shift or get one picked up if you need a shift covered for whatever reason.,"The managers don't care about their employees. They don't really value team members like they should. There is a lot of favoritism from the managers especially as far as accountability goes. They give you a really hard time if you have to call out for a shift, they don't really care if you're sick or have personal things going on they just want a body to fill the position whether you're in a good position to work or not. I gave this job a two stars overall because I feel like managers can really make or break a job for you. So to have a crappy management team that is unfair to team members and does not value or treat their team members like human beings makes it a little hard to want to work for that place.
