Finau F.,Millbrae  CA,152,38,50,9/15/2017,3.0,This is definitely a place you can resort to if court food doesn't cut it for you in the mall! Personally after trying a handful of entrees I only seem to get the two same things each time I come here Parmesan Chicken and the infamous cookies n' cream Pizookie! There's always a long wait but it's nice there's a Barnes&Noble and different shops near to roam around until they text you with your table ready! Customer service could be improved but in such a busy chaotic place that's obviously asking to much of these young waiters/waitresses.
Tanya F.,Fairfield  CA,82,20,33,9/10/2017,1.0,Seriously the worst restaurant ever:Slow serviceWet platesBad customer serviceDoNot Support!!
Michelle S.,San Francisco  CA,200,143,453,9/9/2017,2.0,Yikes.So the venue itself is cool. Nice decor  great vibe. It looks like it's decorated for adults rather than family - which I like. So I was excited.But again  yikes. Food came out super slow. It took so long we almost asked  and we never ask. The server also put our appetizers in as entrees...so our apps came out at the same time as our entrees - which was pretty frustrating.Also  two of our dishes were straight up COLD. Like not kinda cold  like cold. Like my sweet potato fries felt like they'd been sitting out for 30 minutes. I sent them back and the server didn't seem surprised or apologetic. Seemed kind of like the norm...The sweet potato fries were good  my fried calamari was okay. Our garlic knots app was okay...the couscous mac and cheese was okay...everything was okay. I would not recommend this spot. Only if you live in the area and your options are limited. Too bad  seems like it has a lot of potential just misses the mark.
Danielle S.,Pacifica  CA,246,33,50,8/31/2017,4.0,Did you know that BJ's has a ton of promotions now including 50% off large pizzas and $5 margaritas on Mondays?? No? Well  now you know!! I'm not too sure when they started these weekly promotions  but on Tuesdays they have discounted pizzookies. I believe there are a few more but they didn't catch my eye -- so be sure to check their website to double check what the other deals are. I came here on a Monday night and the wait was ten minutes. We ordered a large great white (deep dish pizza topped with alfredo  chicken  tomatoes  mushrooms  and garlic) -- each large has ten slices. Between my friend and I  we ate 2-3 pieces each and still had enough to bring home. After the promotional discount and limitless strawberry lemonades  our bill came out to about $22 after tax and tip. Even though it wasn't the most busy Monday night  we didn't get too much attention from our waitress. As stated before I had ordered a strawberry lemonade which has free refills  but I was only able to get one refill because our waitress barely stopped by our table and was pretty hard to find when she wasn't directly in front of our table.Overall  I am extremely satisfied with these new deals BJ's has come out with and I will probably be going a little more often because their great white deep dish is literally the best.
Teena N.,San Francisco  CA,35,235,1076,8/26/2017,3.0,Second time here  first time dining in. +Spinach Artichoke dip was delicious !! Creamy goodness.+The girl waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She made sure to check on us at the right time and was very informative. -Deep dish pizza was alright  made with fresh ingredients  but seems like a regular pizza more than a deep dish.-Clam chowder was okay  creamy not too flavorful. Added pepper  still felt like it was missing something.+Poozookie  salted caramel was delicious  next time I order it  I would ask them to ease up a bit on the caramel. Overrall  the waitress  appetizer and dessert was what stood out to me. Definitely coming back for the spinach dip.Enjoy!
Diana C.,San Francisco  CA,259,169,374,7/18/2017,3.0,A little overpriced but for BOGO  sure why not? Definitely a sports bar feel with tv screens overhead and broadcasting basketball games. We sat near the bar which also was near the outside patio if you wish to sit by a fire pit. The menu is extensive and makes one scratch its head on deciding what to get. We settled on pizza and pasta and got the chicken fettuccine alfredo and a small pizza that we did half/half for toppings - 1/2 Great White and 1/2 Gourmet Five Meat. I didn't realize they were deep dish pizza. I have to say that the Great White was my favorite because I love alfredo sauce. The pasta was good too but pretty simple dish. I downloaded their app and was able to score a free mini Pizookie and got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. If you show your waiter your app code  you can get points for your meal and you can also pay through mobile. I wasn't sure if he was coming back with a paper receipt so I just ended up paying on the app. I would probably come back for some pizookie or bar bites/beer for a game or if there's a BOGO happening. That's about it.
temo g.,Daly City  CA,35,19,3,9/4/2017,1.0,I went there with the family for a post movie meal. Huge mistake...I ordered the soup and salad. The salad was just okay with a bottle flavored dressing. The soup  clam chowder was horrible. First off  it was supposed to be a bowl and not a cup so I expected a lot more. It did actually comes in a bowl but was only filled about 25%... I literally put my spoon into it and hit bottom! There was only about half an inch of soup! It was cold and nasty.Wife ordered the shrimp with quinoa. She had about 3 bites and said it was disgusting.The kids shared a brewery pizza. It was soo greasy and disgusting my starving kids didn't even finish a slice each. What hungry kids turn away pizza?! Never!This place used to be good. It just seems to get worse each time...Yuck!
Monica M.,San Francisco  CA,227,80,239,9/1/2017,1.0,Let me first off and say thank you to the manager and the server for trying to make a horrible night better . We had an horrible evening here due to the kitchen staff not paying attention to orders . We came into this location after a night of back to school shopping we made a huge mistake . We first started off with drinks then we order appetizer . We ordered chicken wings served with dirty celery (picture to follow) . Then ordered a split pizza that was suppose to be half combo and have buffalo pizza . The kitchen made it barbecue chicken not buffalo . Contacted the server and to make it right she was going to have a new pizza made and it came out barbecue AGAIN ! Not sure what's going on in the back kitchen but we will not be returning ever again . Oh and their floors are so sticky and slippery ! Could have fallen on their dirty floors !
Chandra D.,Redwood City  CA,56,421,492,7/11/2017,3.0,Dude. I haven't been to BJ's restaurant in years. When I was younger  my youth group and I used to frequent this place after many church events. It was always open late  affordable  and had a variety of entres to appease many tastes.After my husband and I watched Hamilton in San Francisco  we took a Lyft back to the San Bruno BART station where husband's car was parked. It was close to midnight  we were hungry  and the only thing that was open was BJ's. BJ's closes at 1 AM! We were hesitant to go to BJ's because we hadn't been in forever  but since it was open we decide to give it a try.Okay  the food is not that great and there is nothing to write home about. However  if you've just gotten out of a movie at Tanforan  or you're in need of a late night meal  BJ's has got you covered.We started off with spinach artichoke dip  but my husband and I wished we would have skipped the appetizer and had dessert instead.The shrimp tacos I ordered were mediocre at best  and I kind of wished I would have opted to order a pizza. I ordered French fries  and those weren't that good either. Our waiter was a little spacey  but he was trying to manage multiple tables after midnight  so I gave him a pass. He forgot my fries  and it took him awhile to notice. He also forgot to refill our water glasses.Sadly  I was too full to order a pizookie. That's what I wish I would have ordered.Honestly  this place is a two-star joint  but I gave it three stars because it stays open so late. If you enjoy late nights  like a sports bar feel  and don't care too much about the quality of food  BJ's is a good late-night option.
Alan F.,Hercules  CA,59,371,62,8/24/2017,3.0,A sort of faux-brewpub in the Tanforan shopping center; in spite of a show of brew tanks inside and out  the physical beer production for this location is actually carried out at BJ's Roseville facility.Big open dining room  open to but distinct from the bar area. Menu is casual dining  roughly on the level of Chili's or TGI Friday's. There's often a wait for seating at peak hours  and sometimes slow service. We've come here more often for snacks while shopping than for full meals. We keep returning to two of their appetizers  the spinach and artichoke dip and the mozzarella sticks.Seven full-time house beers on tap  plus two rotating taps and at least one guest tap. On a recent visit  I went for the ones that were new to me:- Light Switch Handcrafted Light Beer. Clear gold  light head. Virtually no nose. Light-bodied malt  low bitter hopping; about as much character as  oh  Miller Lite--which I'm sure is exactly the effect they were going for. A training-wheels craft beer for customers who'd just as soon not be trained.- Nitwit Belgian-Style Witbier. 4.7%  9 IBU. Cloudy yellow  light head. Weak orange nose  but the taste is much bolder  with banana ester and yeast notes. Also a spice note; the menu copy describes it as coriander  but it tasted more like allspice to me.- From the guest tap  Belching Beaver Nitro Peanut Butter Milk Stout. 5.3%. I had encountered this in its bottled version in San Diego earlier this year  but it was my first time for the draft rendition. Dark brown  medium cream head. Chocolate and estery nose. The taste has a definite peanut butter and chocolate presence  sort of a liquid Nutella; also a bit of peanut husk in the finish. Smooth nitrogen mouthfeel.
Kathryn Y.,San Bruno  CA,18,226,1177,9/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,My boyfriend and I went here for a date night. We haven't been here in ages and it did not disappoint.We shared a deep dish pizza and then did the pizookie trio.Food was delicious  our waiter was terrific and was on top of things. This was definitely better than previous experiences. We'll be back.
Anita L.,Union City  CA,315,528,338,8/18/2017,3.0,"The roasted shrimp peruvian quinoa bowl was surprisingly good and (supposedly) pretty healthy for you too. It was a win in my book. They also have a decent beer selection here. However  there are never any new offerings so the selection becomes a little stale. Being a ""brewery""  I would advise corporate management to really look at introducing more variations of beer. The San Bruno location is always packed whenever I come and the wait is usually quoted at being close to an hour for two people. It\'s a 50% chance of being able to nab a seat in the bar area."
Circadian R.,San Francisco  CA,38,15,1,9/9/2017,5.0,The location  service  and food was excellent. I'm a celiac and was scared to order. Food was delicious. I'm posting this 3 days later to say my stomach hasn't hurt and I haven't had any symptoms. They really make sure that cross contamination doesn't happen!
Seyla S.,San Francisco  CA,55,5,18,8/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I'll been this place 4x now. Had a problem but once again the manager efraim made it all good very hospitable and nice. He made sure our food came out quick! Greet service!!!Thank you again Efraim ur the BEST!!!!
Heidy S.,San Francisco  CA,54,4,14,9/12/2017,1.0,I waited for 30 minutes  and they let people in first who just waited for 5 minute. DO NOT TRUST THE text message system  they will just leave you behind and wait.
Joshua M.,Daly City  CA,142,370,1379,8/21/2017,2.0,I've been to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse at Tanforan a twice to celebrate certain events. My first visit here  everything was decent in that the food wasn't all too bad nor that great. It was simple American food to make for a good casual dinner in a setting that is nice for conversation. I did really enjoy one of their desserts though which was like a giant cookie with ice cream on top.However  upon my second visit here  I ordered a potato dish that I just couldn't eat. I think they did a poor job cleaning their dishes because the potato had the smell and taste of washing detergent which really deterred me from coming back.
Sarah B.,South San Francisco  CA,4,10,11,9/13/2017,1.0,I'm someone who's been here multiple times and had never had a problem before. However after one bad experience  it's pretty safe to say that I'll never be back. Long story short  I ordered one of my favorite meals  Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and I ended up with food poisoning hours after. I wasn't mad at the place  I just wish that they would know better and not serve or prepare expired/ bad food to guests. Afterwards  I contacted the establishment online to let them know about my experience and to please try to avoid it from happening in the future. I received no reply or apology whatsoever. Not that I was looking for any kind of sympathy  but if your food gave someone food poisoning  wouldn't you feel bad? Definitely not saying this will happen to everybody  but if you want to order the Clam Chowder after reading this  lol go for it.
Adrienne B.,San Mateo  CA,7,16,348,9/3/2017,5.0,This is a long overdue review. First and foremost  out of all the BJ's restaurants that I've been to  this branch is my favorite. The hosts are very friendly here and always have a smile on their faces when you walk in. I've also never had a problem with any of the servers here. My favorite server is Katrina B.! If you go to this branch  and have her as your server  you will get above and beyond service. If you see something wrong with your dish  she will deeply apologize and immediately have it fixed. If you need extra condiments  she'll get them right away and won't keep you waiting. She always checks up on you to either make sure you're enjoying your meal or to ask you if there's anything she can do to make it better. Top notch service! Thanks Katrina B.!
Raina S.,El Granada  CA,383,565,342,8/29/2017,1.0,"Wow  the food here is just awful. It fuels my theory that  the bigger the menu  the harder it is to make anything very well.Service was a bit odd. Our first server walked up to our table and just stood there. No  ""Hi  my name is..."" nothing. Her shift ended after she took our order and another person took over. He was a bit of an improvement. My husband had a burger. He didn\'t like it  but ate some. My daughter got a French Dip. The meat was cold. I asked her if she wanted something else  but she opted to got with no food over bad food. I ordered the cauliflower tacos. I don\'t see this often on menus but when they are done well they\'re delicious. No surprise  here  BJ\'s doesn\'t do veggie tacos well. Very little flavor  and the veggies were past their prime.Their beer is decent  hence the star. I got a blond ale. The flavor was better than I\'d expected. I wish I\'d just stuck to beer for lunch.When our new server came to clear the plates  there was no mention of ""Wow  you guys didn\'t eat much. Was everything okay?"" I\'m thinking he already knew the answer and just doesn\'t bother to ask anymore."
Amanda C.,Berkeley  CA,273,11,,9/3/2017,1.0,Horrible service  very slow. Waiters need to stop catering so much of their time to big families when there are other couples who need their order taken. If you're gonna have such a big restaurant  please make sure you have enough wait staff to accommodate.
Bob I.,Burlingame  CA,0,15,15,7/2/2017,2.0,Poor service  doesn't make a difference it they are busy or slow its very hit and miss. My pizza needed a few more minutes in the oven  I wish the pizza was a hot as the pan it came in was . A runner brought it to the table so I think it was sitting out for a bit. Some of the toppings were not even cookedOverall overpriced for below average pizza
Jessie K.,Pearl City  HI,0,9,8,8/11/2017,5.0,This place has always been one of my favorite places to eat of all time. First time today that I tried their beer and I have to say that their gluten free beer is the best one yet. Their chicken is the best. What I got to eat for lunch is the lemon thyme chicken and it was bomb. The waiters do their jobs phenomenally.
Blake H.,San Francisco  CA,6,19,11,9/10/2017,4.0,The menu is outstanding. I mean it's really impressive how many options they have. In addition to options being good sized portions  most menu items seem to be really tasty. The prices are fair for the portions  but it's not an amazing deal or anything. Definitely a fun place to watch big sports events. For the warriors championships  it's always packed out with a great crowd and great vibe. The ONLY reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars  is because it's not a 5 star restaurant with 5 star service  like a Gary Denko (5x as expensive). BJ's is an excellent 4 star choice.
Hnin T.,Garden Grove  CA,4,2,,9/11/2017,1.0,Went for lunch on 09/03 mainly for strawberry margarita. After 25 min we got some fries & salad but no drinks. Check with our waiter and said someone from the bar will bring it. It's for him to go & get our drinks. When we got it the frozen margarita is already melted. We told the waiter  he went to get and added more shaved ice. We said it was not the margarita taste. He said he will get us the new one & didn't get at all. Pizza was cold also. Never had that bad experience before. When the bill came they charged for the drinks and we pointed out for the charge for the drinks. Bad.. really bad service.
Bono B.,San Francisco  CA,6,116,5,7/24/2017,4.0,Terrific service headed up by Efrom and the other attentive waitstaff along with decent food from the kitchen made an impromptu Sunday night out very enjoyable. I'd say the food is a solid 3.5 based on what we ate  and the great service adds another 0.5 star to the entire dining experience. I normally don't go to chain restaurants (nor give 4 star reviews frequently)  but given our situation and choice  it turned out to be a great option.The Brewhouse Blonde Asparagus was nicely fried  with a nice  light crispy batter and a dusting of parmesan cheese on top. The creamy  garlicky and slightly tart aioli that came with the dish was a great foil to the appetizer. As with the fries  the frying on the asparagus was executed well  with no greasiness.The seasonal salad offering of watermelon  pickled red onions  crisp spring salad mix  and feta cheese crumbled on top was a nice  refreshing summer salad. The vinaigrette dressing was nice and tart  and worked well with the sweet flesh of the diced watermelon. The picked onions may have been a tad too salty  tart  and portioned too generously relative to the greens  but all in all  pretty good salad that I'd like to try replicating at home.BJ's Brewhouse Burger was surprisingly tasty. Maybe not as good as my fave burger from NOPA  but the patty was flavorful  the lettuce  onions  tomatoes  and pickles were fresh and were a good match-up for the burger  and the parmesan crusted bun gave the burger a nice  buttery richness. Not exactly like a brioche bun  but in the similar ball-park texture wise. I didn't need to add ketchup or mustard to the burger - it was seasoned very nicely as-is. I would say it's up there with Super Duper and In-and-Out in terms of quality. And I mean this as a compliment without any irony. Those places make a terrific burger  and BJ's burger can go toe-to-toe with them. The accompanying fries were nice and crispy  just as they should be.The Shrimp & Asparagus Penne was the least favorite dish of the evening. I'd have to say the kitchen kind of killed the pasta - it was over al dente  nearly mushy in texture. I wasn't too thrilled with the marinara either. It was much sweeter than I'd prefer - it was almost like they'd put in too much tomato paste in the marinara. They may have been better off just making a simple tomato sauce with olive oil  thinly sliced garlic  black pepper  and sea salt  and sauteeing the shrimp and asparagus very quickly in the end in the sauce.In general  I think the simpler dishes fared well whereas the pasta dish that required more components didn't do so well. Perhaps something to think about as you navigate their menu and order your meal.
Jaine L.,San Francisco  CA,45,28,,8/30/2017,1.0,About a month ago my friend was having a drink and a rat ran up her pant leg!!! Why is this place still in business!! Shes not the type to write a bad review or any reviews for that matter so I took upon myself to inform people that go to BJ's at tanforan that this place is probably infested with rodents. All management did was to offer us a discount ! Haa... what a joke!!! Not sure why this place still gets some 4 stars reviews...but overall there must be a reason why this place has 2 and only stars!!
Kira S.,Oakdale  CA,134,11,2,8/29/2017,5.0,Its a great place to go for a quick bite or for a family outting! Everything is served right  and when it isn't  someone always smoothes it over. Everything on the menu I've had so far has been pretty good. I really enjoy that they have lighter options.
Blyss L.,The Strip  Las Vegas  NV,0,15,19,6/29/2017,3.0,Hit and miss. It can be really great and consistent and then you'll hit a few waiters or nights in the kitchen where you're like what the heck is this (which I know happens  and that's fine) but on two occasions now the waiter/waitress have done less than impress me to make it right. 1) broccoli and cheddar bread bowl. Instead of coming out to tell me there isn't enough soup I waited until my bfs burger was delivered and beyond with repeated check ins with my waiter. When my crusty half full bowl of soup arrived it arrived without the bread bowl. When I inquired about this I was then brought out a bread bowl on the side...even though my crusty cup of soup was cold and basically done. I was still charged though...I let it slide. 2)tonight  I came in to Mary dianna as my server. I'm writing this complaint with a compliment oriented goal because she knocked my socks off right off the bat. She delivered perfect service from polite greetings  suggestions  service of refills  attitude and personality anddd listening!!!! I asked for the brussel sprout appetizer with extra sauce but not on the side ideally because it's cold and would taste so much better hot. Her and the cooks delivered! Omg! Soooo yummy 10 stars. And perhaps Mary Diana and the cooks set the standards too high but when she had to go on lunch break and I attempted to tell it to my new server the results were less than satisfactory. 1- it came out without the extra sauce..honestly less sauce than normal (I come here way too much for this dish) and huge half cuts of dry sprouts that they would normally cut again. 2-after requesting for extra sauce and explaining that I don't like the cold sauce it comes out with the cold sauce on top. 3-after again explaining my poor dish goes in again 1 more time and returns drowned in oil and less sauce than I had to friggen start with. 4-with the look and expression of disappointment to my server about my oily sprouts in the end nothing was done to fix it. I wasn't even asked if I wanted a box for my oily sprouts to take home. (Server number 8)It doesn't take much to make things right but for $7 I'll think twice about coming here again for the 2nd time in a week with my boyfriend because I don't want bad service. I missed you Mary Diana after you left. You're a rock star and I hope to see you in the future if we decide to return.
Christopher Y.,Burlingame  CA,102,205,141,7/16/2017,3.0,BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse was where I celebrated my birthdays as a young kid. I loved the warm calamari  the crusty pizza  the tasty pasta  and the gorgeous pizookie (Pizza/Cookie/Ice Cream). However  when I began to grow up more  my taste buds craved to explore other cuisines rather than the regular traditional American-style cooking. When those other cuisines became more regular in my diet  my craving for American food bursted  and I brought my attention back to my home  BJ's. I felt relived when I tried their flavorful appetizers  especially my favorite  their calamari. However  I genuinely felt disappointed with the pizza because I have tried many other great pizzas  so I knew what was sightly overcooked-- our pizza was a bit burnt. Overall the food was decent  although it was a lively experience for me. The building was pretty dark and lit nicely. There was enough room to walk by to get to the restrooms too. Waiters can also be nice but sometimes they ignore you. Last time I came  we were told to ask our designated waiter because nowadays some people do not want to get their hands dirty for another waiter if they are not being paid tips by that table. Ultimately  I still like this restaurant and would recommend it for other visitors. There are good times and bad times  but my childhood turns that around. There are nice televisions to look at for sports so it does not get entirely boring if you feel awkward in a conversation. In the future  I hope they can train their waiters better as well as improve their outside eating area. Thank you for a nice visit BJ's.
Diana G.,El Granada  CA,3,123,42,1/29/2017,3.0,"Service was excellent. The young lady was very nice. However  the food was just okay. Calamari was minimal. For the price  we should have received an appetizer that could be shared. The size served could have been eaten by one person and they still would have left hungry. We also order a BJ Favorites Deep Dish pizza. In my opinion this is not a deep dish pizza and the name should be changed. This is a ""Thick Crust"" pizza and not deep dish. Was disappointed to discover that it was nothing but a bunch of bread with minimal toppings and sauce. It was just okay in flavor. The tomatoes need to me omitted or substituted for fresh tomatoes. They tasted like they were canned tomatoes. Also had a beer and cider. The carbonation is way off. The cider tasted more like soda. The stars all go to the young lady (Daniela  I think). It\'s okay to come here  but be picky about what you order."
Allyssa V.,San Mateo  CA,422,2,4,6/18/2017,2.0,Let me start off that my family and I aren't even done eating here. Just finished our apps after 15-20 mins of ordering. Still waiting for the main entrees. It's fathers day and i understand that wait will be long however  Our server is this old man who took 10-15 to greet us  came and said he'll be back. 7 mins later  where's he at? Had to ask the front for our server. Food abnormally taking forever. Ive eaten here plenty of times and wait time between apps and entrees are never this long  esp on a holiday. Currently  looking around and the other tables have the same issue as us  looking around for our food and server... just checked the time  and its been an hour and we dont have our main entrees out yet...
Julia B.,San Mateo  CA,50,8,,9/9/2017,1.0,A while back I went with a friend for happy hour and was very disappointed with the rubbery calamari. we complained to the manager and we started talking in further detail about how long he had been there. And he was telling us that he had just a started there and that he was planning on making a few changes.We were super impressed by his confidence. we gave it another chance and went back a month later and it was so much better. The service was wonderful!.... Last night... ugh! I know it was a Friday but the service sucked! We had called an hour before we arrived to get our name down because we were a larger party  we did and the person that took our name said it would be an hour and half wait. So we took our time getting to the restaurant because of the wait. We get there and we confirm with the hostess to get another estimate because it had been an hour already. the Hostess then told us that it would be 2 hours. We were so frustrated  so then we thought oh maybe there will be a few tables that would be available at the bar area. There wasn't but a few tables looked like they were finishing up so we were diligently watching. I asked the host stand if that manager was here and they said he had moved to a different restaurant... what a shame!! He ran that restaurant very well. This family walks in way after us and a server walks up to them and greets them as family and whispered to them oh yeah there is a table that is about to be getting up... I'll save it for you. I was so pissed at that point because we had already been waiting for an hour. I think the servers name is Jon.I wont be going back there. Terrible service!
Rach Q.,Concord  CA,129,12,3,8/17/2017,1.0,Whatever wait time they estimate  add on an extra 45 minutes. Ridiculous. Once we got seated and ordered  the appetizer they brought us was burned!
E F.,San Francisco  CA,2,118,,8/24/2017,4.0,Let's be honest - all the dishes are predictable American classics  but the execution is pretty darn good for a chain. Friendly efficient staff. Cool for hanging in the sports bar also cool for families in the restaurant. Much to like here.
Mercedes R.,Anaheim  CA,15,67,,9/3/2017,1.0,One star is far too generous. Incredibly disappointing as I love BJ's but this location is in need of some work. The server forgot about our food (actually questioned out loud if he even had put the order in)  didn't bother apologizing when he did finally get around to bringing out our appetizer and by then the chips and spinach dip were cold. He disappeared  not bothering to check on us. Then another server came out with a 2nd spinach dip which was supposed to be ours...not sure where our server got the first one. The table sat after us got their food first and when our pizza finally came arrived it was mildly warm like it may have been sitting out. Though the manager was nice when we discussed this with her  I wouldn't return.
Cindy C.,San Mateo  CA,410,446,3272,10/12/2016,1.0,I don't know - I'm just not a real fan of BJ's. I honestly prefer Red Robins in terms of food.SO wanted to stop here for an early evening dinner before the movies. It started off with waiting 45 minutes for a table. There's almost no seating in the lobby so many patrons just had to stand with kids running around all over the place.Then once we finally got seated and my SO ordered a beer  it was on to more waiting. 15 minutes until our waitress finally came back with the beer and we could order. I remember looking at the clock constantly because I didn't understand how it could take so long to make an appetizer and pour soda on to ice cream. Another 20-30 minutes until our food and my drink came.Finally our California flatbread arrived. It was surprisingly good. Bacon  avocado  and ranch and are a winning combo on anything  but the portion was very small and not filling. Definitely meant to be more of an appetizer.I ordered the orange cream float  that came with free refills  but didn't receive any because our waitress just never looked back after dropping stuff off. It took so long just receive an appetizer and drink  we didn't dare order anything else. We were already late for our movie at that point and just wanted the check. It took 30 minutes to ask for a check and pay. No one paid any attention to us and my SO had to aggressively flag another waiter down.Total of 2 hours. 2 hours to get some flat bread and a drink. We couldn't get out of there quick enough and haven't returned since.
Darryl B.,San Francisco  CA,103,3,2,8/16/2017,1.0,If I could give a zero I would! Terrible tasting food. Less than mediocre service. We will most definitely not ever come back. Did they microwave our food??? Let's not even talk about the pissy non taken care of bathrooms . Thumbs DOWN ! We should have went to Jacks !
Stephanie A.,Millbrae  CA,0,5,1,8/20/2017,3.0,Three stars for the food and ambience (let's face it  half the menu is frozen). But 5 stars goes to our waitress Asia. She was so sweet and attentive- she made an otherwise mediocre experience exceptional! ** Added by my Mom: Tell them she was outstanding! Lollll
Lawrence L.,San Francisco  CA,1,46,,9/4/2017,1.0,Been here many times for years... never have been so disappointed.After waiting 1/2 hour for our very simple order of turkey burgers and baked ziti  we finally got served but had to ask and wait another 10 minutes for our silverware and napkins.The waiter asked if we wanted a ice-tea refill  but after another 10 minutes  we decided to just leave and asked for the check. Well  he decided to bring us someone else's check for $130 and ran off. After chasing him down and getting our correct check  we couldn't leave soon enough. Was it busy? partially up front  but where they sat us in the back  it was less than 1/2 full. Were we not served because we were Asian  or some of us were elderly?In addition  the floor leading to our table in the back was extremely slippery... were surprised that no one fell while we were there. Also  the Men's room was disgusting as they obviously had not cleaned it since who knows when. Don't know what has happened to this establishment  but it has gone WAY down recently.
Roman T.,South San Francisco  CA,0,7,1,7/5/2017,1.0,A training on how not to treat a customer is how wetreated by our server. When we left the restaurant  even tho I wanted to just brush off the terrible service  I felt we were rudely served from beginning to end by this lady server that I felt the need to call the restaurant to speak to a Manager. I recounted to the Manager (Rachel) how we were not given utensils when our order came and when we brought it to her attention  there was no apology and gave us two sets when there was three of us. No offer for condiments was made altho one order was hamburger w unlimited fries. No refills for fries was offered during the meal. We of course  startednoticing this inconsistencies including refill for the drink which she never made until I asked for the bill. After sharing this with the Manager and she apologized and said this would help them in their personnel training. Not worth coming back here.
Mark R.,South San Francisco  CA,80,104,231,3/19/2017,1.0,This place really disappoints me. First the hostess was unfriendly. My family and i wanted to sit outside and she said they don't sit people outside till 5pm. I told her its 4:55pm and she said that's not 5pm. And she said the wait to be seated outside was 30 mins. So we're sitting there waiting around 5:15 I saw the other hostess starting to put people outside. I was thinking they had a reservation. After ten minutes I went up the the hostess that I was talking to earlier and I asked her about the outside tables. She said she forgot to text me and we're next. No sorry from the hostess. Our waiter looks like she didn't want to be there. Our food looks good but my order didn't look like what was on the menu. My order looks like it came from the kids menu. The portion was so small. Sorry BJs but you failed and we won't be back.
Ellen H.,San Francisco  CA,0,222,93,9/25/2016,4.0,"I was going to leave a 1-star review because of very slow and inadequate service  but the new manager  Clint  stopped at my table and personally took care of our food/service. Clint really helped make our lunch a good experience.Below was my experience prior to Clint: I am writing this review as I\'m sitting at the restaurant. Usually  the food is pretty good here and service so-so  but today the service has been so slow that it is very frustrating. We\'ve been sitting at our table for 30 minutes and we\'re still waiting for cream and sugar for our coffee even though we\'ve asked our waiter twice. He just put down our appetizer without any plates. Then when he brought us plates it was covered in blue dishwashing liquid. The waiter did not ask me how I wanted my steak and when I remembered  I tried to tell him ""medium"" but he didn\'t appear for so long; when the steak arrived it was extra rare.Another employee came over and explained that he\'s the new manager (Clint). He was very apologetic and explained that he knows there are problems  and that him and new management are trying to fix things. Clint ended up taking care of our table  ensuring that we got clean plates and cutlery  and had the kitchen make me a new steak. Clint checked on us several times and was able to turn what was originally a frustrating lunch into a nice lunch."
J M.,San Francisco  CA,3,98,164,4/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I figure I left my two star review on here long enough  since it was all about a disappointing hamburger  which I won't order again. But since then  I've eaten many different menu items  most with satisfying results. My favorites are the thick and juicy pork chop  the weekend prime weekend special and the spare ribs. I also like the buffalo wings as an appetizer. Other good dishes are the shrimp and mahi mahi tacos and the Californian grilled chicken with avocado sandwich. Service is typically above average  with few exceptions. And sometimes the food delivery is not spaced well  but it's not a perfect world either. I still come often  so that says a lot.
Bruce B.,Armona  CA,0,23,5,8/28/2017,1.0,Horrible. Small tables  lousy service. The waiter was slow. I had to ask for a refill of my Pepsi. Both glasses were watery. I asked if my lunch was ready when he brought my refill. He brought it out. It could have been good. Portion size was small. Food was cold. I have eaten at BJ's in Sacramento. That was a superb restaurant. This one was poor. I am sad I wasted my appetite on this place when I had so many choices. I did not think it was real busy but it tool a half hour for a refill and over an hour for 2 tacos.After receiving the response from general manager ochoa  I read through other reviews. Sad to say  many other people had similar results at this BJ's. I see that Mr ochoa likes to give a form letter response to bad reviews. Not very professional or caring.  He acted much like his employees. Hmmm.
Raneen S.,Burlingame  CA,183,4,3,8/4/2017,1.0,"the only thing i\'d give this place 100% is 100% no stars if i could.BJ\'s has the worst service i\'ve ever experienced in my life. my family and i decided to come here for dinner wednesday night despite the fact that we\'ve had multiple crappy experiences with them before. we thought to give them the benefit of the doubt-- not worth it. we were seated around 9pm and ordered our drinks and food all at the same time because we didn\'t want to eat too late. we ordered an appetizer  a flatbread  salads  and soup... easy and quick meals to prepare. our appetizer came out fairly quickly  which was nice.but then everything went downhill from there. our waitress went MIA  we were waiting for an HOUR for our food  no one came by to update us or check on us  we began questioning where our waitress even was because we didn\'t see her walking around or tending to other tables. finally  we asked another waiter to find our waitress and when he came back he said she ""is looking for our food"" to which i asked  ""what do you mean looking for our food? do you put it any place other than the kitchen??? is it lost?"" like how does that make sense? so the manager comes out and tells us for some reason our food was just sitting at the counter the whole time and no one came to bring it to us and didn\'t want to serve us ""lukewarm food"" aka cold AF food and said they\'re remaking it. she offered to bring us out food that ""could be made instantly  like soup"" which is what we ordered an hour ago... so we told her no thank you and we got up and left. she comped us for everything  as she should\'ve. never coming back here again. BJ\'s was great when they first opened and now it\'s just trash. don\'t waste your time here."
cynthia K.,Burlingame  CA,0,16,1,8/28/2017,1.0,I've eaten at this restaurant a few times and service was always really bad  today I decided to give it another chance as it's close to my work  went to the bar area  no one paid attention no menu so I went to the bar  bartender didn't pay attention either  I saw a server looking at my direction but decided not to pay attention either  I'm almost running out of my lunch time so I decided to leave infuriated  so people  go somewhere else as these people at this establishment doesn't seem to care about customers who walks to their door  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME EATUNG OR DRINKING AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!
Ti S.,San Francisco  CA,106,140,131,2/25/2017,1.0,Friday 2/24/17 around 11pm.Wow  where to begin? Co-hostess/usher makes comment in front me (paying customer  mind you) that she has to bring another party to their table. Yup! No professionalism or customer service here. Chili came out luke warm. Just from the looks of the spinach and artichoke dip (warm)  I already knew it would disappoint. The dip had an extremely liquidy consistency. I can only describe the dish to look like light green milk with bits and pieces of spinach and artichoke. Is there a spinach shortage that I'm unaware of? First thought in my head was there must be lack of staffing in the kitchen. I had the full rack of ribs (actually hot) with fries and chili. The ribs were the most edible item I had there all night. Fries were doused with salt (extremely over seasoned).The bf had the ribeye steak with Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. After trying a piece of the Brussel sprout  I dare not try the rest. It was probably frozen  reheated  frozen again  and reheated until overcooked. Granted our beverages came out way later (no refills on waters or soda)  our utensils came out way later  and our condiments came out way later  we were shocked we actually even got the items. All and all  one of the most terrible dining experience yet. Never expected this from a known establishment. First time here after a few years and this experience just reminds me of why I shall never return.
Ryan V.,Burlingame  CA,0,1,,8/3/2017,5.0,I came here tonight  was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday. I was served by an attentive server who really brought his A-game everything came out right and cooked right  so did the wait-staff especially from this one kid with black hair and glasses who boxed my food for me and kept my water filled  always busy it was good to see  he really had my attention. Everyone here seemed to be on it  it seems this place has changed for the better. I've been here a couple times in the past  and this is the first time it really exceeded my expectations of the place. Will come back  keep up the good work.
Stephanie L.,San Francisco  CA,31,113,600,1/26/2017,4.0,BJs Restaurant in San Bruno is my favorite place to go for happy hour! Their cocktails are the best especially the strawberry margaritas and classic mojitos! Their calamari and stuffed mushrooms are so good. This time around  my bff and I had strawberry margaritas. We left BJs happy like always . Cheers!
Ryan L.,Daly City  CA,13,1,,8/1/2017,5.0,The best chicken wings I ever tasted the salad was awesome and the pizza was good but I wouldn't say it was the best but this is still the best food I tasted in like forever!!!
Brian L.,Houston  TX,240,75,58,7/1/2016,1.0,Literally one of the worst BJ's I've been to. The wait staff is really friendly and accommodating but the food was horrible. It was actually one of the best wait staff I've had from a BJ's  super friendly and understanding. Beers were fine  and the appetizer was pretty good (got the Brussel sprouts). The main dish my girlfriend got was the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was atrocious. Breading was falling off  soggy  no seasoning. And they gave us two sides of broccoli instead of the listed broccoli and mashed potatoes. Manager took it off our bill but girlfriend left hungry. Won't be back.
Lynn C.,San Francisco  CA,205,464,1947,6/29/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I hardly come to bjs unless im having a pasta craving. I havent gone for awhile and found they discontinued the cajun shrimp pasta. It inclined me to get the chicken fettucine with brocccoli.The pasta was lukewarm. I was so hungry  i let it pass. The pasta wasnt cooked to al dente. It was still hard. There was 4 bits of chicken in it. Dont get me wrong  it was a hefty plate of 2$ worth of pasta. But i expect a chicken breast in a 16$ plate.My bf ordered the ribs with wedges on the side. The ribs were dry and the bbq sauce was subpar. The best thing about dinner was the wedges. They at least made that right  crispy outside  soft inside. He also had clam chowder as well. We expected a small cup of it and were pleased to find it was a large bowl. It was on the salty side but was okay. Didnt come with crackers :(Overall  i have come to the conclusion that bjs is a brewery and specialize in that. The rest is just there. I wouldnt order food unless it was their pizookis or pizza because they specialize in that too and i have had them before just not at this location.If they are going to serve expensive food  they need to make sure every dish they send out is hot and cooked well  not dry  not raw.I dont think ill return for their food. And i dont like beer  so not even for that.
Mike O.,Daly City  CA,22,115,43,6/7/2017,3.0,I used to come to BJ's for lunch quite often when I worked down on Sneath Lane.They have quite a good and filling deals for around 9-12 bucks. The menu changes up every so often.At lunch time there usually is no wait to be seated  but if you have a huge party you may want to call in ahead of time.My favorite deal for lunch is the unlimited soup and salad. I would usually order the Caesar salad and like 3 rounds of clam chowder. There was one time they ran out of clam chowder and we had to sit and wait for 30mins just so they could make a new batch. The other issue is that even if they have it ready  the waiter takes almost 15mins to bring another bowl of soup after the first round.The overall taste is fine  but there's just a lot of waiting to get your food.I do occasionally stop by with my friends for dinner as well. They have pretty good deals for Happy Hour; I think 50% off select appetizers  and cheap drinks. Again  it's pretty hard to flag someone down to put in your orders and then again to pay your bill.In conclusion  food is not bad  but they need a bit of work on service.Warriors game nights can be fun here!
Hector B.,Littleton  CO,53,173,13,6/6/2017,4.0,The best part of BJ's is their salads! There kale and brussel sprouts are amazing  add grilled chicken and it's only 660 calories. You will be full and really enjoy it. Their seasonal beers are best! Great place to go without spending a ton! I go at least once a month with my wife!
Amanda L.,San Mateo  CA,76,212,144,6/9/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,WOW. You guys blew it tonight. I understand there was a Warriors game on and the restaurant was more busy on a weeknight than it would have been had it not been for the game. But really?A friend and I came by to have dinner before watching a movie. We received our menus and were thus forgotten about.We waited for thirty minutes  we asked for help to a couple of servers passing by and they said they'd grab our waiter for us. Never happened since no one came to us.Mind you  WE DID NOT EVEN GET WATER.And when we decided to leave  we went to the front and told a server who was STANDING with the hosts doing nothing  that we were leaving because no one served us. Is it because it was just a table for two? They decided to overlook and ignore us for the bigger tables where they'd get more business and thus bigger tips?Unacceptable.
Brian C.,Reno  NV,214,161,151,12/6/2016,1.0,Wow...I love BJ's...but I don't like this one at all...this location was filthy  filthy  filthy...the bathroom had only 1 working stall...piss and shit was smeared all over the walls...the service was horrible...the service was horrible...did I forget to mention the service was horrible...I was afraid to eat the food by the condition of the environment...it was a last ditch effort for something to eat and I chose wrong...Negative -5 stars if possible...
Kirstie P.,Daly City  CA,426,92,1236,5/30/2016,3.0,#75 I used to come here a lot before they decided to break my heart and take the BJ's brownie off of their menu. Unlike most people  Im not really into pizookies. I just think its way too sweet for me. Alcoholic beverages aren't strong enough. I usually ask them to remake it. Service is always slow whether or not you're in a big party. The only reason why I still come here is because their food is consistent. For the past 5+ years  I've always ordered the same thing: Parmesan crusted chicken  avocado egg rolls  and their brownie before they stopped making it. Prices and menus have changed over the years but these dishes remain constant. Recently I decided to finally try something new  so I ordered their deep dish ravioli. It tasted like a gourmet Hot Pocket but expensive. Not worth it. I like the concept of their rewards program but last I checked  you couldn't give them your phone number and you had to bring your rewards card with you every time. That makes it difficult to accumulate points.
Patrice B.,Daly City  CA,0,7,3,9/8/2017,2.0,Ordered online and our food wasn't ready when promised  which made my son late for work. 30 minutes waiting for food is pushing it when dining in  for pickup  unacceptable. Management needs to be upgraded.
Anny W.,San Francisco  CA,421,148,60,11/5/2016,2.0,"Once in a while  I\'m craving something hearty. So I suggested to eat here for dinner on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. First off  the wait was 50 minutes. Fine- I get it if the restaurant was packed. I walked by the windows that were faced towards the mall and saw a whole row of empty tables/seats. That could\'ve easily fitted 4 parties of 4 and 4 parties of 2. How is that even efficient? 50 minutes passed and I didn\'t get a text. I went to check with the host and he got extremely defensive about it:""Sorry mam. I gave you 50 minutes as a estimated time that you\'ll be seated. We can\'t do anything to make it any faster. We have customers who are just sitting there after dinner. You will just have to wait.""That was a total uncalled for response but whatever. My boyfriend and I sat in the waiting area for another 10 minutes. So the total wait time was WHOLE HOUR.The waiter that served us was not attentive and seemed to be all over the place. We ordered appetizers  soup  beer and two entrees. I can officially reward this BJ to be the longest wait time in the world for an appetizer. We waited a whole 30 mins for Avocado Spring Rolls. To put the cherry on top  we didn\'t have any utensils OR plates. I had to ask the waiter TWICE for it. Then my boyfriend\'s beer came  he just slammed it down and walked away! Maybe he felt bad and came back to ""check"" up on us to see how we liked our egg rolls.If you plan on getting the steak with sides of veggies  please do yourself a favor and pass on it. The veggies were really dry and overcooked with no seasoning. I got the bacon avocado burger and my waiter didn\'t even ask how I wanted my patty to be cooked. I got a well done burger patty and I only eat medium rare! Total fail.When it was time to pay  I asked the waiter for two box and a check. He was wandering around and checking up on tables around us. He saw me glaring at him and he already forgot to give me the things I\'ve asked for. I waved my hands to get his attention to ask where\'s the box and check? He apologized and said he totally forgot *rolls eyes*.He came back and said the printer ran out of receipt paper so he has to get his manager to re-print it the receipt. This means ANOTHER wait?! Omg someone please pass me a beer.This was my fifth time visiting BJ at this location and I vow to never return. The last time I went  they forgot about utensils  plates and the wait time for the food was ridiculous as well.The management needs to step their game up because Red Robin is nearby and they can steal your customers and business in a heart beat."
Aaron C.,San Francisco  CA,104,5,1,8/9/2017,1.0,Came here for Happy Hour today  horrible service. My expectations weren't high to begin with but failed miserably. How many times do I need to request utensils so that I can actually eat the food brought to my table? Do you not have enough utensils to go around or what is the issue? How do you have people that say they will be right back with it but completely disappear?
Angelo H.,South San Francisco  CA,62,12,8,8/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Horrible service. Staff never apologized for missing orders  wrong order given  and ended up waiting 1 hour for food when the place had only 6 full tables (excluding bar area)  and plenty of staff just crowding around laughing among themselves in front of me. One hour  and none of them followed up.
Keith A.,San Diego  CA,560,308,4128,7/14/2016,3.0,Typical BJs set up  decorations  motif.Same menu as other locations.Location is in a mall near a freeway. Servers were nice  friendly  expedient  got the order correct and followed up a few times.Food was good  warm  came out fast after ordering.Plenty of TVs to watch sports.
Candy W.,San Francisco  CA,2,25,9,8/11/2017,1.0,"BJ\'s is one of those places we go to when we realize  ""Oh let\'s go since we haven\'t been there in awhile"". We arrived around 5:30ish PM on a Friday and it was a 20 min wait before we got the text notification that there\'s a table ready for us. I looked around the restaurant and it wasn\'t all that busy  despite the fact that it\'s around dinner time. Our waiter (from what was stated on our bill) was ""Jimmy A"". A tall gentleman with a man-bun and a tattoo on his neck. It took awhile for him to take our orders  which was fine since I saw him talking to a party of 4  two tables down  across from us. For drinks  I had ordered the refillable strawberry lemonade. I finished it fairly quick since the cup was full of ice. He hadn\'t offer me any refills until my boyfriend asked. The calamari we ordered tasted old  cold  soggy  and the batter was falling off. We had to use our hands since we didn\'t have utensils on the table. I didn\'t get the chance to catch his name but a different waiter (tall  slim  African American) had brought out our entrees and he was so apologetic  I wanted to give Jimmy A\'s tips to him instead. Not once were we checked up on  but I\'ve seen him with the same table of 4 across from us  at LEAST 5 times. What\'s up with that?My boyfriend insisted on not leaving a tip  but I still left 15% because I work in the food service industry as well. I would get it if maybe he was having a bad day but the service was so terribly poor  I didn\'t care enough to put that into consideration anymore. The least you could do is say ""thank you"" when we give you the check/tips."
Stephanie S.,Citrus Heights  CA,0,14,,8/12/2017,1.0,If there was an option for no stars  I would have taken. Pretty patient when it comes to busy Saturday nights and a party of 6. However  when the entire table is served their food and the 6th person has to wait 15 minutes... It is totally unacceptable. I believe since we complained  the one meal was comped... But too little too late. No more bj's for me or my family.
Emily N.,San Leandro  CA,38,4,9,4/5/2017,5.0,"Party of 15 people for a birthday dinner ""Elda"".Reservation outside patio by the fireplace.Server was awesome and one of the manager there name ""Efraim"" was awesome and attentive too and made sure our food was hot knowing we were eating outside! Food and drinks was delicious!Good servers starts with how well your managers are with you....Thanks to one of the manager there name""EFRAIM""."
Wendy H.,San Francisco  CA,104,1299,312,6/2/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Came here for lunch on Saturday. Place wasn't so busy but we waited a long time for our food. Minus one star for giving me stone cold fries. Seriously they felt like it was cooked and dumped in the fridge for 5 minutes. That's how cold the fries were. However  the server was quick to correct the problem. I got fresh hot fries as soon as I flagged him down about the problem. I did like my portobello mushroom burger. That was super yummy.
MaryElise C.,Pacifica  CA,0,1,,9/6/2017,1.0,Very slow service. Had to wait 45 minutes for a glass of wine and then had to track down the server to order our food. The food was barely warm when it was finally served. Not pleased with my experience.
D L.,San Francisco  CA,2,77,42,4/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,This place is just like being next to a college campus. The service is so-so  at best. The table was dirty when the hostess sat us. The napkins withe the silverware inside... well just a fork. When the food was dropped off and the server dropped it off and ran. I g ad to waive down the waiters to ask for ketchup  mustard  and some knives.
Alex B.,Oyster Point  CA,47,24,,5/12/2017,2.0,I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes  it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar  I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately  food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes  but of course  there are shining exceptions. The food is decent for the most part  with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times  and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard  but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas.While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller  contrarily  entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much  but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable.Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food  but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth.
RM M.,San Francisco  CA,28,1,,8/10/2017,1.0,Horrible experience!! I USED to come here a lot. and yes I did say USED to. But my mom wanted to check this place out since she never been here. First our appetizer was burnt to the extent that it has a bitter after taste. Told the server that this is not what I expected since I've ordered this in the past. He said Brussels sprouts are suppose to be bitter. I partially agree to it but a bitter after taste tho? Plus you can literally see burnt pieces?? Uhhmmm maybe not. Second was our main course... it took 42mins for it to be served. I was staring at our server since The table next to us arrived after us but got their meal first mind you we had similar orders except for my deep dish ziti which all came out warm and not hot. Fries were missing. You can tell our dish has been sitting out for a while. And to top this wonderful experience of we were still on our tables getting ready to leave he took the check book to check if we left a tip. Ive never been to restaurant that checks the bill before we leave.
Md G.,San Bruno  CA,0,29,2,9/3/2017,2.0,"This is a tip regarding the enlightened cauliflower tacos: Don\'t. I like cauliflower  but it really doesn\'t work as a taco filling in these. The pita was fine as a substitute for the tortilla and the other taco fillings were fine  but the taco-seasoned cauliflower? Nope. Also  this is served with ""seasonal bistro grains"" which turned out to be plain brown rice. Plain. Brown. Rice. There is some good stuff on the menu. Order something else."
Serena  E.,Stockton  CA,3,11,1,7/22/2017,1.0,Terrible service. Food was not fresh at all and I don't think I will be coming back to this specific location.
Robert F.,San Francisco  CA,87,655,4187,5/8/2016,3.0,Came here about 2 weeks ago and it was an interesting experience for sure!When I arrived I was informed that the bar was open and that the floor seating was full. That was fine so my party and I decided to walk around and wait for a table to open up. After shopping around at the near by Barnes and Nobles the timer went off and the table was ready. Upon returning to the restaurant my group and I were seated and handed menus. The menu is just as advertised. Lots of choices to choose from if you have a big appetite. If you like beer this place is for YOU! There are several TVs here which is great because the NBA playoffs were on and that was a primary reason for stopping by to eat lunch. I wanted to at least watch till halftime before leaving but we left midway through the 2 quarter. My issue with this place stemmed from the server. He was just not attentive or interested in serving anyone. The way in which he placed the plates on the table to serve us was nonchalantly. I mean  if you don't care about getting a tip or tipped well I get it. Or  maybe you just didn't feel like coming in today. I was not sure what the issue was but it was not necessary. I will come back and give the bar a try next time. I have heard good reviews about the drinks and the bartenders. Also  the beer selection here is worthy trying as well.
Shilpa S.,San Jose  CA,7,43,127,3/12/2017,4.0,Great neighborhood spot! Sat in the patio area on a beautiful sunny afternoon. Even though the patio was covered only by one server he provided great service!! Drinks came quickly and cocktails are made well :) our server despite being so busy made sure he adjusted the umbrella so that our baby wasn't in direct sunlight. Why I would go there again...Great variety of food and drinks  Indoor and outdoor seating  good service  clean bathrooms with diaper changing station!!
Joy W.,Woodland Hills  Woodland Hills  CA,183,440,2557,3/5/2016,3.0,BJ's is on par with all the other chain restaurants. So  I don't see why people would wait an hour for a table at BJ's  except maybe because it's one of the only sit-down restaurants with waiter service in the Tanforan mall.*To reduce the wait time  you can 1. Call ahead to be put on the waitlist. 2. Now  you can also download their mobile app and use the Preferred Waitlist function. 3. You can even place your order for dining in on their website.4. The bar area is open seating.*They try to cater to very different demographics. I get it  they're trying to capture as much market demand as the area has to offer. It's half a sports bar and half a family restaurant  which makes it rather confusing and not very optimal for either dining group. Sometimes you sit next to a tipsy frat boy  sometimes next to a screaming baby. Sometimes  you're within earshot of both. I'm just kidding...sort of.I've never been a fan because BJ's doesn't have many distinguishing signature dishes that sets it apart from other casual dining establishments. Wait  there are the Avocado Egg Rolls & Pizzookies...meh. Oh  and a decent beer selection.Avocado Egg Rolls - avocados  cream cheese  sun-dried tomatoes  red onions  cilantro  chipotle peppers & spices  with sweet tamarind sauce:Pretty good idea taking something good and fatty  wrapping it in spring roll wrappers and frying them. Crunchy & creamy  sweet and a just a little bit spicy. Not bad  but I can't stomach too many  because they're so oily and heavy. After a couple of these  they just feel like a lot of mush in my mouth. One too many and it would make me a little nauseous.As for the Pizzookie - the beloved pizza/cookie (cookie large enough to share) topped with ice cream. Frankly  I prefer cookies that are already individual-sized so I wouldn't need the use of a knife and fork. Yes it's good. Cookies and ice cream tasting good is like telling me the sky is blue. It's also a fine example of taking something that already exists and giving it a catchy name. Good marketing  but not exactly a novel idea.That's a little harsh. They do come in different flavors  after all.For more of a substantial meal  I usually get a burger. Burgers are always a fail-safe option in diners. The beef is usually cooked nearly well done  but they're meaty and filling  and that's all that matters.The pizzas are not bad. Although  the deep dish pizzas really shouldn't be called 'deep-dish.' It's more like thick doughy bread with some cheesy toppings.Ever since the FDA required chain restaurants to include nutritional info on their menus  I admit it somewhat influenced my decisions...briefly. I tried a salad  which I rarely do  because I usually prefer to make my own salad than pay a high mark-up for a dressed up pile of lettuce. But it turned out to be a pretty good salad.Santa Fe Salad - romaine  blackened chicken breast  red peppers  jack and cheddar  avocado  corn  diced tomatoes and corn tortilla strips w/ Santa Fe dressing:I chose the Santa Fe  because I like crunchy tortilla strips in my salads. They're like less-dense croutons with the same satisfying crunch. The dressing was creamy  but not heavy. Chicken was seasoned well. The ingredients tasted fresh and crisp.Chicken Wings drizzled w/ buffalo & ranch sauces are A-okay. We once received some raw chicken though. To be fair  it was only raw in the center. I understand mistakes happen  but they should have frying chicken down to a science. We told our waiter about the raw chicken and he was apologetic  super polite and friendly. They comped our chicken and brought out our second plate of cooked chicken. In my opinion  I kind of thought our meal should have been comped. Raw poultry is not to be taken lightly.Overall  the menu is  in a word  boring. That is to be expected  because it is still meant to cater to the masses. Still  I never find myself WANTING to visit BJ's. It's just an okay option if you're hungry after watching a movie. Mr. Joy likes this place for their happy hour deals  but after the raw chicken incident  I finally told him I have no interest in returning BJ's again. Raw food or not  there's really nothing at BJ's that I crave.On the plus side  I've always enjoyed the snakebites here. Also  I've always found the service to be pretty damn good. I don't know if my server was gunning for a big tip  but he brought me a refill of my drink before I even took a sip of my first one. Another time  I stupidly left my cell phone in one of the booths once. I came back all worried and harebrained  but my waiter kept it safe for me. What a great guy.
Michael L.,Daly City  CA,409,36,36,4/20/2017,5.0,Haven't been to a bjs in around 5 years. Only went because I had a gift card that was given to me and a coupon for $10 off $35. Man was I surprised. We got the prime rib special and a breakfast omelet to meet the $35. The prime rib also came with a pizookie and soup which we got the clam chowder. The food came. Wife and I pretty much only finished the prime rib items because there was so much food. Clam chowder was a huge bowl and had a generous portion of clams. Prime rib was huge and the pizookie was delicious. Ate the breakfast food for dinner. Very satisfied.
Olivia H.,San Francisco  CA,137,55,9,3/28/2017,3.0,"The food is good and exactly what you would expect from a BJs. My friends and I are partial to their appetizers  particularly the spinach artichoke dip and Sriracha Brussels sprouts. It\'s not necessarily the restaurant\'s fault  but this place is consistently overcrowded. Wait times in any time approaching dinner are out of this world  and we have frequently left after discovering it would take over an hour and a half to seat two diners. Since the service is generally slow  it\'s not too surprising that they cannot open up tables more quickly. Unfortunately  they don\'t take reservations  either  so there is little chance to get ahead of the rush. I tried the ""priority waitlist"" option they now offer throught the BJs app  and they did not grant us any priority  and one host acknowledged they had forgotten our names had even been put in. The menus are sticky  and requests to change TV channels are rarely honored  although they claim they will do it. It\'s an overcrowded American-style chain restaurant--sometimes the tasty bar-food apps are worth it  sometimes they\'re not."
Iishia S.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,7/22/2017,1.0,The service was horrible  they didn't bring me one of our side dishes. Rude waitress with no customer service skills.
Rich K.,Mountain View  CA,34,42,23,7/9/2017,1.0,Got there around 10pm sat. But even though its late slippery floors and dirty bathrooms are no excuse(my sis said overflowed toilets poorly cleaned up  hard not to step in urine in men's restroom). Cupertino was a lot cleaner
Sarah P.,Petaluma  CA,0,6,1,6/21/2017,1.0,Hour to hour 1/2 wait : after about 40 min. I went to the restroom .....not a single stall had tp and was filthy! I mentioned to tonight's bartender.  he laughed and said well did you just use your hand? Whhha? Ok maybe he was trying to be funny  but no apologies .. whatever our party of four decided to go someplace else. Better get your bathroom checks in order bjs
Jessica S.,San Francisco  CA,181,173,134,2/15/2016,4.0,I only really come here when I'm craving pizza. I always get the deep dish pizza to share with someone  and usually the calamari. I also always get the pizza half and half-yummy.I love both dishes. I've occasionally tried other dishes like the ribs which were tasty as well.The only downside here is the service. It's super slow  don't expect to see your waiter again after they drop off the food or to refill your drinks. You have to really flag someone down
Elizabeth R.,San Mateo  CA,1,22,32,2/21/2017,4.0,This is as good as BJs gets. I have been to many and I like this one the best. The servers are nice  sometimes forgetful  but still nice. I've been here several times with coworkers. They always have sports on TV and usually there are seats open in the bar area. I like the bison burger  lower calories than many items on their menu and it tastes really flavorful. I love the sangria that they have in the menu  pro tip  try it blended!!
Ed H.,San Francisco  CA,40,17,,8/13/2017,1.0,What happened to this place?!?! I used to like coming here because the service was good and the food quality was good. Now it seems like no one wants to work here and the food quality has gone down. I had to ask 3 different people for condiments and of course only 1 brought them after 15 minutes. I also ordered a Caeser salad with extra croutons and dressing. Come with neither. Had to ask for the croutons and dressing 2 times and they made it feel like I was bothering them and it was my fault. Looks like BJ's is going the way of Elephant Bar that was at Serramonte. Never coming back. Paid $50 for lousy service and food!!!
Jesse C.,San Francisco  CA,51,210,384,2/13/2017,4.0,Jam packed on Thursday at 5ish Orr so ya digggg...first time here...will plan to visit other B.J. locations...
Dominguez J.,South San Francisco  CA,35,27,41,10/28/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Was quick to get seating. Took 15min just to get water. Food was not appetizing so didn't even eat much. Service was slow. Wouldn't want to come back  rather go to the Hillsdale mall location.Update. Getting a seat was fast tonight 10-26-16 but took 45 minutes to get our food!! Never again. I'm all done with second chances. This place isn't worth the time and the food was bland. Better off at red Robbin or jacks across the street.
Henry L.,San Mateo  CA,2301,828,2654,1/15/2016,3.0,The wait here is crazy long! Gotta get here early.The inside is decorated pretty well. The staff are young--not exactly experts in what they do  but pretty nice people. The food prices are ok  and the portions are huge. Especially the starter combo--that was a lot of nachos.Overall  a good place to hang out and chill with friends.
Charles R.,San Francisco  CA,1,7,1,6/11/2017,2.0,I have been wanting to do a review of this restaurant for quite some time now and even though it's been over a year since we last visited this place  here are my 2 reviews of both times my girlfriend and I went.1) This was from our November 12  2015 visit: On this day  I met my new future girlfriend for a 2nd date. Even though it was late at night  we felt unwelcomed there. Believe me when I say that this restaurant needs new management. Service was extremely slow. Sometimes  the servers don't show up for about 10-15 minutes and you're just sitting there waiting. Yet  we were sitting at a table that made us visible to everyone. After we ordered  our food came out warm  not hot. We only ordered appetizers. The tv's are great  but the atmosphere is very bland. I also noticed too that the wait staff tend to hang around with one another  ignoring customers. I actually saw one employee texting. There was no evidence of management around to delegate authority  so the staff do what they please. It would be a great place to go to  if there was a manager there that would be more strict with the staff. 2) On March 12th  2016  my girlfriend and I went there again (last time was our 2nd date in November  2015 (see above))  and it was the same story as before. When we walked in I approached the hostess counter and gave my name and for 2 people. She said it would be about a 15 minute wait. Well  after waiting at least 45 minutes  I went up to the hostess counter and asked them how much longer for a table (there were 3 tables open). When the hostess asked me who I was  I told her and for 2 people. She apologized as she said to me that they thought I was a party of 4. The other hostess couldn't distinguish between 2 and 4. I made it clear that we were a party of 2 and she put 4. Next  after finally getting to the table  we ordered drinks and ordered the Fried Calamari  Fish & Chips and the Deep Dish Baked Ziti. When we got our food  it was lousy. Really poor quality. The fried calamari was cold (we returned it and the 2nd order wasn't better)  the fish and chips were so  so greasy  you can actually see the oil they deep fried it in shine off the fish and fries. And you can actually see the oil drip off into the wax paper. The Deep Dish Baked Ziti wasn't any better. I spoke with the Manager  and he agreed to remove the Calamari and I also told him about our past experience. Now this manager was from Texas. Why would you bring in a manager from Texas. Was this location so bad that they had to bring him in? Well  even with him there  it still was the same. The only good thing was our waitress. She was very nice  professional and polite. Overall  after our past and present experiences  I give that restaurant a Grade Rating D-. The only reason as to why it is not a Grade rating F (Failure) was because of the drinks and the waitress. As of today  we have not been back to that restaurant and I don't feel that we will be going back there anytime soon. It's just not worth it. I'm sorry  but that restaurant needs a major overhaul.
Tanya B.,Millbrae  CA,0,5,,6/13/2017,1.0,Took way too long! Mediocre food and service. To top it off  there was a piece of chicken in my dessert!
Clifford W.,Daly City  CA,13,389,919,3/26/2017,3.0,Snack here in San Bruno shopping mall. Ordered light since we had dinner waiting at home. Deep dish pizza and drinks were good  service a little slow for off lunch/dinner time  and tv to watch basketball while waiting. Only con was the plastic coated menus could use a good wipe down with degreaser/soap as both menus were sticky and grimy.
Rois L.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,9/11/2017,2.0,It would have been nicer  which is I believe to be part of the customer service to check and ask the potential clients/customers if they needed help when they're standing there  looking so unsure and uneasy. I was standing in front and actually have fallen in line by the take out service area and I agree  I should have looked closely around and read whatever was written but I didn't. But then I patiently stood there until 2 of the people in front of me were done. I still patiently stood while the manager was speaking with one of the staff manning the area. There was another staff on that same spot that wasn't saying anything and was just giving me side glances until I finally deicided to approach to ask if that is were I need to ask for seating. She pointed me to the direction of the one on the right side which clearly I didn't notice. It was btw so close by my right side while I was patiently waiting in line. I've been to other restaurants and bj's brewery restaurant in the Bay Area and the minute I walked in and stood there looking unsure  some staff will always approach to ask if I needed help. The bottom line  poor customer service and considering there were staffs available milling around while I was standing  no one bothered to ask while I try to give each and every one that look of someone needing assistance. It was so uncool and disappointing. I hope this feedback will help the management focus on how to improve their ratings.
Marty J.,San Francisco  CA,194,426,390,7/30/2016,1.0,No surprise that this place has a 2.5 star average rating. The food can be OK. Anytime I go in here  it's always a long wait. For what? There's nothing special about this place. The best item they have is the dessert pizooki  but so does Elephant Bar and it's a much better experience.I had to write this review because my wife convinced me to do DoorDash and get it delivered. They forgot to put the Bison burger in the bag so the dasher had to go back and pick it up. When they got back there were no fries with it. Come on  what a waste of time and money.Instead of going here  go to Red Robin in San Bruno. Same type of food  just better and not much of a wait.
Franko F.,Daly City  CA,0,3,,8/25/2017,1.0,Hello I came to this restaurant but it is bad service I sat in the patio to order a beer wait 44 minutes with no costumers.. and no one approached I went to order at the bar and pay at the bar. Very poor service I do not recommend it.... :(   
Jassy P.,Daly City  CA,559,198,1356,6/5/2016,4.0,If you have 6 or less people in your party  I suggest call ahead and put your name in the call ahead list to skip the waiting but if it's pretty busy u may have to wait a little bit. But usually I get sat down right away. We came during a sharks game .. good thing we came right at the right time because It was getting busy right after we arrived. Food came later than expected but we weren't in a rush and understood it was a full house and crazy game going on. Food was good as always. Are server was nice and even tho it was busy  she kept checking In on us and making sure our drinks we're refilled. BTW before you leave  I suggest you try a pazookie.. at least once in your life. Its amazing.
Nataly B.,Charlotte  NC,24,11,,6/27/2017,1.0,"We were seated fairly quickly however our server didn\'t show right away. Meanwhile we looked at the menu decided what we were going to order and yet no server. Once he arrived (15 minutes after being seated) we orders our drinks and right away we order appetizers and our meals. After our order was placed we waited 10 additional minutes for our drinks. We got our soup (which was cold) before appetizers. Once our appetizers arrived we got our main course about 15 minutes later. We had asked our waiter for refills and he forgot! He laughed and walked away. Didn\'t bring our drinks. When we saw him again we asked once again for our refills which he replied ""oh yeah right"". Given our experience we will not be returning to this establishment."
C R.,San Francisco  CA,0,11,13,10/17/2016,5.0,Their strawberry beignet is delicious! Oh my! I recommend to share this dessert along with the churro pazookie. Just the right amount of sugar delights.The overall service can be delayed if it is busy. However  it has improved tremendously over the last year.
Allison Y.,San Mateo  CA,1,233,,6/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,If this bar/restaurant wishes to get beyond a 2 1/2 * rating overall then they ought to take seriously the complaints & actually do something about the problems. But apparently nothing changes to improve.Why on a weekday with a number of servers walking the floor were patrons forced to wait 20-25 minutes to be seated? Especially when there were empty booths to one side & later on they accommodated others. Even the 'hostess' was unfriendly & indifferent. But overall our server was all right. It's just that the timing of our orders were just questionable: Appetizer arrived with the main  drinks took forever to reclaim from the bar  and dessert was even tardy. Of course  our server apologized profusely for the delays  but this should not even occur. The food was okay nothing outstanding. The fried calamari looked great  but it was disappointing that the batter was not crispy. And the presentation of some of the meals was just not appealing. For instance  the fish and chips was plated in a metal tray. Others were plated on wares. I just do not get the metal tray choice as it looks terrible like if it's a huge TV dinner container or something an institution would provide its inhabitants; it certainly does not belong in a restaurant.At least the cocktails were pleasant.All in all this revisit was just all right. We would not purposely dine here again unless as in this instance it's for convenience.
Merrick W.,Pacifica  CA,16,164,5,6/3/2016,3.0,I understand the lack of enthusiasm for this place -- it's because of the lack of enthusiasm from its kitchen. The hostess was great very friendly and helpful and got me a great table. Took a bit for my server to ask for drink order  but that's ok  she made it up in friendliness and great service  and was pretty prompt in getting my order.Ordered soup and entree salad -- only problem was that salad came out first -- pretty quick  which I appreciate  but the cup of soup should have been first and I had to WAIT on that.  To me  kitchen's fault more than server's. When I finally got the soup  it was lukewarm.  I told server not to remake  just nuke. Got the soup and it was good.Then tackled the Asian Chopped Salad  which had been sitting on the table all this time and although great ingredients  it was pretty uninspired. It just had no kick to it like other salads of this kind  and the chicken was just OK  like it had been sitting around all day and was thrown in the salad  not fresh. And that's the thing -- the whole salad was missing freshness.I really think you guys (BJs mgmt) need to take another look at how things are prepared in the kitchen  how incoming orders are processed  etc. I don't see the problem as much being the servers and everyone in front of house  who are all working their butts off  as much as those in the kitchen and back of house -- maybe they don't have enough support?Excellent menu  so BJs does got it going there  but the operation of it all really needs a looking at and an overhaul.
Leticia C.,Paso Robles  CA,11,1,,5/17/2017,2.0,Our waiter was great! Took our order promptly and very polite. Food was good. Had a Cesar salad and pizza. It was the seating that was not cool! Checked in and told it would be a 10-minute wait. Mind you  there were plenty of 2- seat tables available. During our wait another couple checked in. While we waited another couple walked in and before they could check in they were asked if they were 2  which they confirmed and they were escorted to a table by the manager. The other couple called it discrimination. Didn't cross my mind until I realized the couple they sat without checking in and the 4 of us that were still waiting. FYI  this is not the first time this has happened at this particular restaurant. Sad and disgusted with BJ's in San Bruno!!!!!!!!
Mike R.,Antelope  CA,0,10,,7/3/2017,3.0,The place is a little dirty   not a pleasant feeling inside the restaurant. The food is good but I would recommend the manager to take a closer look at the tidyness of the place
Nikki Q.,San Francisco  CA,103,14,6,9/8/2016,2.0,Came here a couple of days ago with the boyf. It was an hour before closing  (& we hate ourselves for being those type of people) but we just wanted a drink & to share a plate. Service here kind of sucked  even though there was barely anyone in the restaurant. We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip. I kid you not  they tried to play me. Literally only half the bowl was full. Being the socially awkward person that I am  I didn't want to complain but three chips in & I could already see the bottom of the bowl. No Bueno. Our waitress saw how little of dip we got but I think she was just hoping we weren't going to say anything. We did & got another small bowl. So not satisfying.
Angela K.,Novato  CA,174,505,92,5/21/2016,4.0,"Did anyone say ""pizookie""? I am obsessed with these naughty delights at BJs. Always warm with a dollop of ice cream  they heavens answer to what a cookie pie should be. And if you\'re not in the mood for a large one  there are mini versions  too. Aside from that  I love their burgers and shoe string fries. This last visit  our waiter was very quick and helpful. Despite being very overwhelmed in his section with over twenty tables to serve  he made us feel heard. My hub and I never had to ask for a refill for our drinks and he knew when the check was needed. The food alterations were also followed through. We were very thankful and ate a delicious meal."
Josephine W.,DuBois  PA,6,4,,4/14/2017,1.0,Would give 5 stars for the restaurant itself because the look is amazing! But the service was very poor and our waitress didnt say one word to us or even smile! We didnt have silverwear for the first 20 minutes of our meal but the food was fairly decent! I would not recommend this place unless you want to watch some tv and have a drink!!
Rosalyn L.,Elk Grove  CA,117,130,1754,5/26/2016,2.0,"I\'ve been occasionally going to this BJs whenever I\'m in the area. Most of the time the food and service is decent and it\'s a great place to catch up with friends  who like me  are indecisive when it comes to picking a place to eat. They have a wide variety of options including pastas  pizzas  burgers  steaks  and they even have healthier (low calorie) options for anyone who feels like eating light.My last experience here started off really well. My family and I started off with the avocado egg rolls and clam chowder in a bread bowl. The avocado egg rolls are always a must for me because I love avocados and these are just deep fried rolls of creamy and cheesy goodness. The clam chowder was also really good. The bread bowl was crisp and light  with the perfect chewy texture. After our appetizers  it didn\'t take long before our main entrees came to the table. What prompted this review and a two star rating was that our dessert took well over 50 mins to get to the table. Every 15 minutes or so  our server came to our table  apologizing for the long wait and stated that our pizookie would be out shortly. I didn\'t mind at first because I was enjoying my company and conversation. After the third apology I was gonna call quits on the dessert but thought ""what the heck  I\'ve waited this long what\'s another couple of minutes?"" BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! Finally  we were told that they would give us another pizookie on the house because of the wait. To my utmost disappointment  not only did we not get the second pizookie  our original one came wrapped up in foil packed as a takeout!"
Natalie C.,San Francisco  CA,0,17,5,6/18/2017,3.0,Oh BJ's. You are one hot mess. My boyfriend and sat on the patio today to enjoy the weather. We witnessed 2 hours of wrong orders  dirty glasses  waiters who didn't know the menu  and all sorts of shenanigans that had us just laughing by the end at the circus that was the staff. This was a repeat performance of the other time we've been here. Upside? We got to know the other restaurant patrons who were just as disappointed/entertained as we were.
Abby C.,San Francisco  CA,30,148,90,5/1/2017,1.0,This BJ's has horrible service and staff. Starting with the host station. The quality of food is also horrible. Compared to the other BJ locations this one has probably been the worse location I have visited. I wanted to give it two stars and I've visited this location a few times  especially during football games and HH prices. But each time I went they always messed up on our orders  overcharged us and added plates to our bill. Also  many times our calamari would come out burnt and the portion would be less and less every time. I would understand if the calamari was on the HH menu then yes  smaller HH portion but it wasn't. All servers are pretty rude and careless to help other tables and even there own. Takes awhile to flag your own server down too  and when you do expect to wait another 30-25mins for water  peppers and new silverware. ALWAYS check your silverware  there never cleaned and have food on them still  yuk. If the Oreo Pizookie wasn't so yummy  I probably wouldn't have returned.
Camille F.,San Francisco  CA,0,8,,7/7/2017,3.0,I've been coming here since they first opened! Every time I come  the ladies restroom are filthy. I had to check three stalls for toilet paper!! Not good  especially if you have a bar! I mentioned it to the manager the last time I came  and he said he would look into it and apologized! Very unsanitary. Do better BJ's
Nyla K.,San Francisco  CA,559,316,336,1/9/2017,3.0,Ordered beer and potato skins during happy hour. The potato skins were just blehhh... not great. Glad it was on happy hour cause I would be mad if I paid full price for it. It was clean and not dirty like other people are saying. There's free wifi. Staff was friendly... I'd give it another go and try a different starter.
Retired Reefer A.,Daly City  CA,68,55,4,7/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,my family and i decided to give this place another shot after personally speaking to the manager Eugene Ochoa over the phone. i described everything that happened on the night we had our terrible experience and he was very receptive to hearing all the criticism i had  where they fell short and personal recommendations on how they could do better. overall the conversation was positive and left me optimistic for our next visit to BJ's.The next visit we took advantage of their online reservation system to ensure we wouldnt have to wait as long in the event that the place was busy. upon arrival we were seated within 5 mins with maybe about 4 parties already waiting. my biggest gripe on the last visit was that we were unquoted on the waittime and ended up getting passed up by other parties that had reserved online. had i known about this service i wouldve reserved online.ordered our food and drinks  both of which came out in in a reasonble amount of time. food was good and overall experience was similar to the positive ones we've had here so i chalk up the last experience of one that was a flyer. it was a busy night. there were some mistakes made that ruined our experience. i applaud the management for actually reading these reviews and making attempts to try to improve based on real customer feedback. thank you eugene
Lin Z.,San Mateo  CA,140,96,285,12/24/2015,3.0,The service at BJs often leaves something to be desired. However  their happy hour is good! 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas is a good deal. Though this isn't really actual deep dish pizza  I still like the pizza here. Happy hour does start at weird times though  it's more like happy late hour for me because I usually can only go to the one that starts late at 10p. The menu is pretty big but we'll usually get some combination of the following  all of which I'd recommend: crisp potato skins platter  calamari  BJ's classic combo pizza  and the Great White pizza. I've also gotten the Twisted BLT salad  which comes with spinach. Actually  that salad makes me feel a little less guilty about eating at BJ's late at night because I'll have it with a few slices of pizza. All in all  BJ's is a good place to come hang out and get a beer and some decent food with friends.
Dorothy B.,Los Angeles  CA,3,17,32,12/8/2016,1.0,I like BJs but not this one.I went out last night with my husband and friend. We ordered an appetizer plate  2 burgers and battered mushrooms along with 3 drinks.The appetizer plate came out first and all of the fried items (chicken wings/mozzarella sticks) were cold. We ate the rest of the items in hope of teaching down our waiter but he was no where to be found. A different server brought us our food but we didn't have any utensils. When I asked for then she brought paper napkins but no rolled utensils. I had to go ask a different server for the utensils before we were able to eat.The burgers were sub par. My husbands was good but my roommates bun was extremely dry and everything was super oily.The family behind us was complaining about their meal S well. The server only came back to ask if we wanted more to drink and never asked us how our food was. When I asked for the check he gave us the wrong persons bill then came back to return ours. Normally I don't complain  maybe he was having a bad day  or maybe he has too many tables. But overall service from all wait staff wasn't good. I got home and I felt sick. I ended up getting food poisoning and was throwing up violently throughout the rest of the night. I don't recommend this location to even my worst enemy. If your craving BJs go to a different location.
haze a.,Daly City  CA,86,10,2,2/22/2017,3.0,"Overall  my family had a typical ""dine at a restaurant chain"" experience. When we arrived we were told it was a 20-25 minute wait  which did not bother us. We were actually happy that they take down our phone number so they could text you when your table is ready. Our waiter was courteous  but we could tell he hated his job. He forgot my daughter\'s order (because he didn\'t write it down) and didn\'t give us utensils until 10 min after we were served our food. Sad to say this is typical for restaurants in malls  don\'t expect warm and happy people working here lol."
Susan M.,Burlingame  CA,166,4,1,4/11/2017,5.0,We've been coming to this location for a long time. And just this past year we have seen significant improvements to food  customer service and leadership! Mauricio stands out as a solid manager with exceptional leadership values and making this a star location!
Christine O.,Burbank  CA,39,16,7,11/20/2016,1.0,I don't know what happened to this place :( I now remember why I stopped going here . Even. G family members was like   why'd you go there ?? You know the service is bad now there.And I agree  The service is just super bad now. Besides the wait time where I was willing to wait anyways before because of the service and good food it's just not worth it now. The jambalaya is so disappointing .it's just full of green bell peppers that's it. The servers .. oh my I don't know they just look so unhappy to be there and it just reflects cause they don't care ... they don't care about the costumersBJs   seriously good thing you guys got the franchise name but oh my . Your loyal costumers are slowly going bye bye .
Veronica P.,San Francisco  CA,0,5,1,12/2/2016,1.0,Patio service sucks ass waited 2 hours to get some fish tacos and Spinach. Fuck this place
Lisa C.,San Francisco  CA,17,6,2,4/6/2017,3.0,I give the restaurant a 3 stars but the manager Efren a 5 stars. Even though the restaurant is overcrowded and hectic  Efren made it all better. He was accommodating and easy to talk to. Even with screaming customers  he was able to handle the situation calmly. He made the whole dining situation a good experience.
Waine r.,Daly City  CA,122,21,245,7/6/2016,1.0,"Wait time for 9"" pizza is 15mins.They served our pizza but forgot to give us fork and knife.Ordered another glass of lemonade but forgot to serve.Ordered Monkey Bread  waited 15mins.."
Meagan C.,Brandon  FL,48,4,,11/13/2016,1.0,This app does not let me give negative stars. My friend  my girlfriend  and I are repeat customers at this BJs for awhile. And now their service is just horrible. We got seating at 5 pm. And it is now 6:26pm and we are still waiting on half our food. All of our meals first came out really burnt 20 minutes ago so we sent it back. And now we are still waiting for our food to come back out.If you want really good food and better service. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT COME TO THIS BJS in San Bruno
Daniel G.,Suisun City  CA,0,4,1,6/3/2017,1.0,I used to like coming to BJ's  the food was great and the beer selection was one of the better ones that micro brewery's had to offer. This BJ's is one of the worst I've been too...I'm not sure if they got different cooks or the cooks there just suck all together because the food is mediocre at best...calamari is always way over fried  the service is terrible and I'm pretty sure my burger moo'd at me when it was brought out...the beer is still good but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here and have a drink....the only thing that would get me to come back is if they offered what their name suggests if you know what I mean
Terri R.,Sonoma  CA,1,15,5,5/31/2017,2.0,Food was good but the wait was ridiculous. 35 min for our appetizers then another 30 min wait for entrees..
Jennifer Y.,Alameda  CA,80,49,3,3/30/2017,4.0,I'm really never a fan of chains such as Cheesecake Factory  Elephant Bar  Red Lobster  etc. But BJ's is my exception! First off- they have HH until 7  where I can get their jalapeo margarita for less than $7. Score. Their bar bites are good as well. The root beer glazed wings are tasty af and of course- how can you say no to their pazookis? But yeah  their margaritas are what makes me want to go back.
Michael N.,Daly City  CA,71,46,4,5/21/2017,3.0,I like the new menu and the diverse offerings. It makes me want to come back and try different things. I just wish the service was better. My server started off well enough  but kept forgetting things after that. I had to ask for more water even though my glass was nearly empty. They brought the wrong side dish for my daughter. After I pointed it out  they made us wait only to bring the same wrong side dish again! I mean  really. I asked for a box for the leftovers  twice. I had a coupon that wasn't reflected on the bill. And so on. If they cared just a little they could get it right. I had a hard time tipping 15% today.
Ruby R.,Daly City  CA,0,1,,7/27/2017,2.0,We came on a Thursday evening  the place was a little crowded but we found a space in the bar. The food came out fairly quickly but the service was mediocre. Nerves got plates for our appetizers and our silverware came halfway thru our appetizer. I'm the end we orders a mini churro pazooki  and the churros were not dusted with cinnamon sugar. How am I suppose to eat a churro without cinnamon sugar. That's what I get for giving chain restaurants a chance.
Cheryle M.,Patterson  CA,0,1,2,5/25/2017,1.0,I dont live in this city but often stay in the area when I'm on a business trip. I really liked BJs until we visited this one. We were immediately seated but once seated  the only time our waitress came back to our table was to take our chair to another table. The couple that came in 10 minutes after us (behind us) was waited on starting with the beverages and then the order.  After being there 20 minutes we quietly got up and left. We were not missed.Service was Below Stsndard and I will share this information. Too bad I have to give a star.
Ximena C.,Daly City  CA,11,33,19,4/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,A manager named Eugene reached out to me to apologize which I really appreciated. He really owned the negative experiences and assured me that he would hold his staff accountable. Really  the only way to see if he's sincere is to give the place another try  which I may. For his follow up  I give them back a star.
Cherylynn N.,San Francisco  CA,4762,1927,8007,8/3/2015,3.0,"Women (preggo or not) have the weirdest cravings. Mr. NSS: ""Where do you wanna eat?""Me: ""I want BJs.""Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh  you forreals?""Me: ""Yah.""Mr. NSS: ""I never knew you had 8====D envy.""Me: ""Who wouldn\'t be jealous of mandingo?""Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh  is there something you want to tell me?""Me: ""Geez  relax...I want to eat at BJs.""I\'m not a fan of chains and I will never understand WHY people would wait up to 2 hours to eat at BJs  or any chain for that matter. But I have to admit  sometimes I need a little avocado egg rolls  cheap liquor  and pizookie (freshly baked cookie topped w/ ice cream) in my life. We came here for their Happy Hour Specials that run Monday - Friday from 3 pm - 7 pm  and Sunday - Thursday from 10 pm - close:*$1 off guest beers*$4 craft beers*$5 mojitos  martinis & wine*$6 for slightly higher tier wine*$4-$6 apps: chicken wings  flatbread  spinach dip  sliders  potstickers  avocado egg rolls  lettuce wraps  and mini deep dish pizza (reduced HH portions so you\'re not saving that much in hindsight)I\'ve visited BJ\'s more times than my check-ins indicate because my family like chains. I don\'t like waiting for a table so we usually try to snatch a table in the bar area since it\'s open seating. On our last visit  we sat in their outdoor patio and brought Tater Tot along: bit.ly/1OKVdtS. As with any chain restaurant  I always come in with very low expectations. The safest bet on BJ\'s menu are their apps and pizzas. On our latest visit  we ordered their Avocado Rolls (HH - $6) to start: bit.ly/1IAycVP. They tasted really off this time. It was sour like the cooks added too much citrus to keep the avocados from oxidizing. After downing two of my very stiff $4 Tanquerey gin & tonics (no top shelf gin)  I didn\'t mind so much. I wasn\'t feeling pizza so I ordered the Sante Fe Salad ($13.50): bit.ly/1M6EUtL which was piled high with crisp romaine lettuce  onions  red bell peppers  chicken cubes  cheese  and crunchy tortilla strips. The salad was lightly tossed in a semi-creamy dressing. Pretty decent and much better than the Sante Fe Salad I had the next day at nearby Nueve (Bayhill Shopping Plaza).Mr. NSS ordered the Ribeye ($23) which was awful! I told him that\'s not one of the items that you should order at BJs but hey  the man wanted steak. It was a cheap cut of meat with zero marbling. It was definitely not a ribeye steak but a sirloin or top round that was slapped onto a Forman Grill type of cooking device. There was grill marks but the rest of the steak looked so rubbery. He asked for rare  it came out medium well so he had to send it back. The second one was cooked better but it was just horrible quality; very tough  dry  and chewy. I had better steak at Sizzler\'s. Management  please take note: either you\'re scamming customers or your meat supplier is scamming you. Your ribeyes are not ribeyes  as another Yelper also seemed to have the same issue. Anyhow  there was no room for a pizookie since we indulged in a second round of avocado rolls  even though they weren\'t that great to begin with. Dayam you  Mr. Tanquerey!Food has always been what it is for a chain: glorified frozen food but we\'ve never had issues with any of the servers who are nice and efficient. We had the same server twice in a row and he was really nice to Tater Tot. He said  his ex-gf had a pom and that he missed him. He even showed us a pic. Awwww.....love furbabies."
rob a.,San Francisco  CA,135,17,5,5/9/2017,1.0,Salad and soup are not unlimited here. Server said she'll be back but saw her after 20 min without my second soup and salad! It was mid day. Not even busy. Ordered from a kids menu for a 3 year old and he didn't get his chocolate milk until we were all done eating and ready for the bill. The server had never checked on us to see if we needed anything else  had to flag down the other server to get our attention. Very Bad service!!
Fred H.,San Bruno  CA,2,22,2,2/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,2-10-2017 Back again. What a horrible experience.....waited forever to get seated (no reservations allowed). Between the drinks being wrong  the food delivery staggered andoverall  taking forever  good bye BJ's.....what a mess  bigly.I love this place. Wonderful atmosphere  the food is top drawer  and the service is crisp. So  why two stars? Got my salad  my wine and then into the twilight zone. No food  then  no food  then  no food  then I complained  then  food.I don't know who is responsible for the kitchen but they need to be fired or given additional training.The place wasn't particularly busy  but the wait for food was eternal. So  good service  good food and a most unpleasant dining experience. Hoping that tonight was a glitch  I will go there again.I love this place.
M M.,Daly City  CA,12,10,25,6/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"The ahi poke is something that I hold true in my heart  of course Hawaii has the best poke and I\'m sure some fancy restaurants carry the best but hear me out!! Bjs in San Bruno was one of my go to places ahi poke places  everytime I would order it would come with a mountain of fresh red tuna  w avocado and poke sauce. It was heaven! And then the fairytale ended  my family and I celebrated Mother\'s Day at Bjs. Obviously I ordered the ahi poke  when it came out it was light pink almost brown  there was less fish  and it was cut horribly! It looked like the chef just threw it on my plate! I asked my server why it looked like that and asked for a new one. He said it was because they had a new ""salad guy"". I got my new one  it looked the same  whatever I ate it. A couple weeks later  I came back and ordered the same thing. It looked like the same thing  but this time  they put less fish! Wtf. I sent it back and ordered something else. BJS PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD ""salad guy"" I used to love your ahi poke."
Rj M.,Metro Manila  Philippines,32,13,2,3/20/2017,5.0,Me and my friends came here for PIZOOKIE  and it met my expectations! A warm dessert topped with my favorite vanilla ice cream. Our server was patient with me and my friends since we barely know what flavor to order  and since we want to hit 3 birds in one stone  our server offered us the pizookie trio which comes in three different flavors. They have bar area and a porch/patio with fire place too! We'll definitely come back!
Shira S.,San Francisco  CA,57,17,8,12/10/2016,1.0,I came here after shopping with my mom and dad. We have come a few times before (maybe 3-4 times)  years ago  and we remembered enjoying it. Sure  it wasn't AMAZING but we didn't really have any complaints. After come here today  we will not go back. You're better off going to the food court.After entering we should have left. There was a smell of grease and fish (not fresh fish  which I can handle  but almost an unclean  old fishy smell that turns you off food).We ordered a tea and coffee first (both were lackluster in taste - quite frankly the worst coffee ive had). Granted they are not particularly known for tea/coffee  it just was bad. All three of us ordered burgers. My dad got the bison burger(comes with coleslaw) and my mother and I both got the bacon cheese burger (comes with fries). Immediately upon seeing our dish come  we noticed how greasy the fries were. Little did we know  the fries were the best part (and they were pretty bad). The burgers were cold. Like... barely warm cold. Tr buns were cheap  not very tasty. The beef was eh  theyre a decent size but lack flavor. They dont skimp on the lettuce  tomato and pickles which I guess is good? My mom only took two bites. We should have sent them back but didnt want to make a fuss (though given the price for cold food...). Maybe it was an off day  but given the other reviews  I doubt it.
Stefanie D.,Millbrae  CA,0,1,,10/8/2016,1.0,I had a HORRIBLE take out experience this evening. I ordered food in advance (by 2 hours) on line to be picked up at 5:15pm. My husband and 4 year old went to pick the food up and arrived a few minutes before it was meant to be picked up. The man at the pick up counter  Ernest L.  went to check on the food in the back  came back  and told my husband it wasn't ready. That was it. No other explanation. So my husband asked if he knew an ETA? He said no. And then he continued to help numerous others who went to the counter to pick up their food. My husband stayed near the counter while Ernest would look up at him occasionally. Forty five minutes later  my husband asked again where the food was. He was told it was ready  but they were still waiting for the beignet and ice cream. Seriously?!? The food was cooked at 4:55pm  and my husband hadn't received the food until 6:00pm. By the time we ate it was cold. The fries were soggy. I didn't get the honey mustard I asked for  and one of the items I ordered with my beignet was absent.This was an inexcusable experience with Ernest being a real joke. Never again will we be going to the San Bruno location  and I suggest others do the same since they obviously don't care about their customers.
Crystal G.,Colma  CA,115,26,2,1/13/2017,1.0,I don't know where to start..I had an upsetting experience this past holiday season. I called to make a reservation for 12 people  all of which were family members coming from different places. My reservation was confirmed and they even took my contact information down.When we arrived  we were told my reservation was lost and they had a larger party of 40+ people and wouldn't be able to accommodate our party. I was embarrassed with my family and asked them to go across the street to Jack's where they accommodated us in a short period.

I love the soups and salads. I have my own menu item: ""Jeannette bread"". The staff is wonderful and welcoming. It\'s like being Norm at Cheers. Eugene  the manager  is a wonderful guy."
Charlotte T.,San Francisco  CA,1,11,7,3/26/2017,1.0,I've worked in the food industry for almost 20+ years there's no reason why a server should lie and say he's leaving and someone else is taking over and don't introduce them on top of that he was still there. Fire and hire new staff past and present if BJ's General Manager don't get it together the restaurant will close. Hire me I'll have the best team  bring revenue  and great food in 2 weeks flat. It's just said that an establishment that stays open till 1am don't have people lined up outside.
Luke Y.,Elk Grove  CA,19,74,9,11/28/2016,1.0,I love eating at BJ's restaurants and stop at this location when I'm in town. This place isn't warm n cozy like others. Their front staff/ host are always looking unhappy. The food doesn't taste great like other locations. The veggies still had dirt from the field on it  when I told the lady she just threw it away. But that's all I have to say!
Carolyn M.,Outer Richmond  San Francisco  CA,1,1,,5/5/2017,1.0,Off tip this place SUCKs... when you first walk in the host and hostess have not idea what customer service is all about
Lauren C.,Alhambra  CA,304,27,40,3/22/2016,2.0,This seems to be the go to place whenever we have large parties to feed. The portions are big and there's a wide selection for food. We almost always have left overs which is great for a midnight snack. I especially love getting their burgers with fries. My favorite is the guacamole burger. It's so filling and their fries are always so crispy and golden. For appetizers  I love their avocado eggrolls and lettuce wraps. I'm hooked on those two dishes.Lastly  let's not forget about the pazookie! If you've never had one before  it's basically a freshly baked cookie topped off with icecream. I feel like it's a tradition to get a pazookie with every visit. If you're with a couple friens  I'd recommend the Pizookie Trio because then you get to three different pazookies instead of one. Whenever I'm here  the service is great. I've had some bad experiences in other restaurants where waiters were inattentive and didn't want to deal with such a large group but not at BJ's. Our waiters were always coming in to check up on us and refill our water. I realize it's hard dealing with more than 20 people so I appreciate that they were extremely nice and organized with our party. The reason for my low review isn't the food but the cleanliness of the utensils and tables. I wish I had more pictures from past experiences but a majority of the times that I have come  I have had to flag down a waiter because there's stains on our utensils or lipstick on the cups. It's made me extremely paranoid every time I come here. The last time I came  I was about to dip my spoon into my soup when I realized there was some weird red gunk on it. Then I realized it was on some of my other utensils too. I think I'm just unlucky every time I come here  but also I really do hope that the staff double check their utensils before they give them out to customers.
Allison T.,San Mateo  CA,0,22,,4/30/2017,1.0,Horrible service. Went with several family members and ignored for twenty minutes just to even get seated. Finally seated and then 20 minutes go by before we even see a server. Waitress helped a table literally right next to us that were seated around the same time as us but we were totally ignored. our food took way too long and thanks to the missing waitress we had to get up and hunt someone down to ask where our food was twice! The icing on the cake was that the food sucked definitely tasted like it had been sitting under food lamps and forgotten about. Pizookie was hard and disappointing. They even had the gall to charge us. Poor poor service. Stay far far away!! In hindsight we should have just got up and left.Oh and this was for a visit yesterday evening 4/29/17
David D.,North Las Vegas  NV,205,19,29,8/14/2016,1.0,Submitted a Complete Mobile Order at 8:10pm. Set my arrival time for 8:45pm. The system would not let me pay.I arrived to BJ's in San Bruno at 8:44pm. I was told by the hostess that there is a 24 minute wait for an available table  even though I placed my order 45 minutes previously. I was sat at 9:10pm  and given a menu  even though I mentioned to the server and hostess that I submitted a mobile order. My server asked to confirm my order repeatedly....it's now 9:22pm....and we're leaving. We'll try again in 3 weeks when the schedules for a family of 6 can be coordinated.Been waiting all week for some BJ's pizza. Oh well. Thanks anyway. And do me a favor  Do not send anything. No free food. A response is unnecessary. We will do things right next time.
Justin J.,Daly City  CA,504,7,4,11/12/2016,2.0,I don't have high expectations when I go to BJ's. I love the traditional wings and for the most part that's one thing I can order that consistently comes out the same. This last visit I decided on starting with a different appetizer.... disaster.I ordered spinach stuffed mushrooms ... kinda. What came out barely resembled what I thought I was getting. These were mushrooms the way raisins are grapes. The service was good  but the food was so disappointing  even the wings couldn't save this trip. It was pretty sad  reminded me of how I felt after hearing the election results this year.
Edward K.,Pacifica  CA,0,6,,7/23/2017,1.0,This was once one of my favorite brew pubs but lately it just seems to get worse with each visit. I brought my family here for lunch yesterday. It wasn't crowded and we were seated after a 15 minute wait. But it was all downhill from there. The waitress got part of our order wrong  we had to ask for utensils and napkins  the order came out staggered  with the final item arriving an hour after we were seated. Again  it was not crowded  there were open tables everywhere. Just a terrible experience  yet again. There was a time I would have rated BJ's five stars but that time seems like a distant past. I simply cannot recommend this place.
Gustavo B.,Fremont  CA,0,8,,5/3/2017,4.0,Been coming here for a while. The service has gotten better back and fourth. We were sat in the a booth today and waited for service. No one came for about 10-15 minutes so we waived the manager Rustie down. Rustie ended up taking our order and getting everything for the us. Food came out quicker than usual and dessert came out quick. he offered us a pizzokie when we downloaded the app. Which we took of course. LOVE IT!!!
Hoa T.,San Francisco  CA,4,100,25,3/5/2017,1.0,Me and my family came here last night and it was the worst experience ever and the food was disgusting.waiter- worse we probably told her five different times for extra sauce and she kept coming back refill but not our sauce. ( if you don't remeber write it on a piece a paper geez!)food- we waited probably like 50 min  that is a long time and when it arrive it was so cold and we sent back. They made it again and it was disgusting.Their food went downhill  i dont remeber the food tasting this horrible. even though manager didnt make us pay for the appetizer or the dessert  i would not come back not worth the wait or the food.
Bryant C.,San Francisco  CA,207,129,81,2/23/2016,1.0,A sad shell of what this place used to be  they've kept their pizza and pizooki and streamlined everything else to be the next Cheesecake factory (or possibly Chili's). This place caters to the easy goers looking for a meal already decided for them and the business plan seems to be working out as there is always a wait. It's a comfortable environment to hang out and have a beer  but the restaurant has fallen to the wayside.FOOD:Avocado egg rolls were somehow served to us cold. Maybe they forgot to put it under the little heater as they waited to bring it to us (even though this was the appetizer). The whole thing was overly salted and the texture was as if it had been put into the fridge for a week then reheated. Then left out on the counter to recool. Then served. Stale. Terrible.The jambalaya was pretty flavorless. An incoherent mess of ingredients tried to be brought together in my usual favorite fashion: oil! Unfortunately  it somehow backfired and was terrible. Dirty greasy food is my favorite type of food and they still butchered it. An absolute travesty when compared to elephant bar's.Maybe I'm bitter that they got rid of my 3 favorite things (open faced chili cheese burger  nachos  and shrimp carbonara)  but the food they served me was objectively bad. This used to always be a safe bet  but when you drop the ball like this  my opinions change. I simply cannot support a place that serves me food like this.
Kimberly G.,Visitacion Valley  San Francisco  CA,32,13,37,8/28/2016,1.0,** THE MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE **I came in on a late Saturday night to grab a couple of drinks and have some food . This is how my experience went & why I gave it one star .The ambiance is okay not cozy   the food is bland there isn't that much flavor but for some reason I keep coming back . I had this elderly white man was our waiter he was disinterested to help us he did not seem to like us or he must of had a bad day & we ended up getting the short part of the stick . We tried to order some drinks & for some odd apparent reason he would take years to come back with the correct one . He was not consistent with us ; he would hardly pass by to our table but he would go to the other tables more than he came over to here :He was just not a pleasant experience I don't think I'm going to come back here . It's really not that good nor worth it . So on that note . . It was super crappy food & service .
Monica M.,Millbrae  CA,0,11,1,5/7/2017,1.0,Super inconsistent. The servings are definitely not worth the money. If you are taking out to go  you are more than guaranteed to be skimped. If you get a soup  be aware that you are paying $6.75 for less than half of the cup that they serve it in  literally 4 scoops and your $7 soup is done. Unless you get the bread bowl  even then they don't fill up the cup all the way. Obviously to worried about losing money but I mean they definitely are because they just lost another customer.
Shawn S.,San Francisco  CA,0,2,,7/16/2017,2.0,Well everyone  Bj's needs experienced help with table setting service and utensil maintenance...went there tonight  order appetizers  waitress put apps. on table but  no plates or silverware. Once silverware got to us  had to give back 3 times because of food residue harden on forks and knives. Salad was great but pasta severely undercooked. Management was excellent on handling mishaps but their in need of professional kitchen help...hope they get it.
Willis W.,South San Francisco  CA,80,3,,4/22/2017,5.0,We've been coming here for a few years. The food and service has been on an upswing in the past few months. Come for the food  stay for the service. Recent menu changes have been for the better too. They have legitimately great prime rib. If you don't want the full dinner  you can get the prime rib sandwich. Definitely worth a try. They do sometimes sell out as the demand is growing. Definitely worth a trip or a retry if you quit coming more than a few months ago.
Steve N.,Fremont  CA,0,11,4,7/1/2017,1.0,"This BJ\'s has no understanding of the cooking term ""blackened"". I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos. First  I was brought plain shrimp tacos. Luke warm shrimp with no spice whatsoever. Not blackened. I returned it and in about 5 minutes they brought my order back with the exact same shrimp  now cold  with a little cajun spice sprinkled on top. Still not blackened. Server agreed it wasn\'t right and offered to refire. I asked that he send the manager over. She apologized  said it would be free and offered dessert for the people eating with me since they\'d be finished by the time I got my food. (Table got a tasty pazookie and a scoop of ice cream.) 20 minutes later  I got shrimp cooked without seasoning and then rolled in way too much seasoning. Very salty. Still not blackened. Everyone else was done and I gave up. Another 10 minutes or so to get a manager over (different than first). She apologized and offered me something else to eat  but by this time everyone was ready to leave. She asked what she could do for me and suggested perhaps a gift card. She sent me away with a $25 gift card  but I\'m not particularly anxious to come back  especially after this experience (and seeing their 2.5 star rating here.)Tip to BJ\'s: Rather than just compensating an unhappy customer  alert the kitchen that\'s about to refire a poorly prepared meal to put a rush on it and to make sure it\'s what it\'s supposed to be. Also  have your chefs see foodnetwork.com/terms/blIn addition to the above  my wife\'s bison burger was not cooked rare as requested. We told the waiter to let the kitchen know  but that we didn\'t want to return it since she was particularly hungry. Tasted charred  but was edible."
Ash C.,San Mateo  CA,0,2,,4/16/2017,3.0,I drove to pick up a togo order  and upon my arrival my food was ready to be taken home. I paid and left to find out our Atlantic salmon had no sauce on it(it was super dry) and the vegetables weren't even cooked!! I felt so bad for my mom because her entree was not a pleasant experience at all :( atleast my entree was good so we shared mine :)
Hayley H.,Eagle Rock  Los Angeles  CA,146,31,21,9/11/2016,4.0,Came in for a late night nite and they're open until 1am! Found a seat in the bar right when we walked in and ordered the Seared ahi salad and artichoke dip. The salad was delicious! Waitstaff was very kind and efficient! Come here for a beer and food for your late night munchies
Mike C.,San Francisco  CA,596,1015,3705,11/17/2015,4.0,Echoing a lot of Cherylynn N's sentiments (yelp.com/user_details?us) on chain restaurants  I tempered my expectations on a recent weekday lunch here. Arriving around 11:30 am  the spacious restaurant was already about 1/3rd full with most diners in the bar area. There are no shortages of televisions so I can imagine the vibe on game days or game nights; in fact  a friend shared that he had a ball watching the NBA Finals here in June. After checking in  we were guided to a booth in the center dining area. The menu is pretty large so  being my first time here  I quickly a checked the Yelp highlights for ideas. Here's what I had and shared: Shared appetizers1) Potato skins (yelp.com/user_local_phot) -2) Fried calamari (yelp.com/user_local_phot) -Entre3) Turkey  ham  and bacon sandwich with side of fries (yelp.com/user_local_phot) and a bowl of chili (yelp.com/user_local_phot) -I also started with a strawberry lemonade (yelp.com/user_local_phot) which hit the spot. At $3.25 with refills  this also was a deal.The food was okay and better than average for the price. My friend enjoyed her clam chowder and deep dish pepperoni pizza which I will try next time. The two apps for two people with entrees were a bit much for us. She took home about half of the calamari and I did the same with the potato skins. There were a couple of service inconsistencies that dampened our experience. Perhaps because we were slow in finishing our apps  the entrees came before we finished our bowls of soup which made the table very small. Also  in trying to hail our waitress Jacqueline  we had a difficult time finding her as it seemed that she was busy somewhere else. Looked like she was doing a solo for our area  the window sections had two waiters tending those customers. Might consider the business flow in assigning the staff.Overall  it wasn't a bad experience  a bit cheaper than Jack's  but with a larger selection of food. Most of my Yelp friends gave two or three stars  but maybe I was just fortunate to catch them on a good day!
Audrey L.,San Francisco  CA,58,3,,4/11/2017,1.0,If I could give this location either no stars or a half a star I would. The food and drinks are good. But on countless occasions when I've come to this specific location  we have had really terrible service. The food doesnt cone out at the same time. I usually order soup and salad and my husband orders a burger. Usually they bring out my order first and we are waiting on his burger. Then when his food comes out his fries are usually cold. If we lived closer to the one in San Mateo we would go to that one.
Osi F.,Daly City  CA,27,47,15,11/29/2015,1.0,It's ok place we got the table .Table is not clean no plates and no forks The serve the food and after that they provide plate and silverware.Don't like it at all !!!!
Brian B.,Columbus  OH,13,64,2,8/13/2016,4.0,While vacationing in the San Fran area with my son and his friend (both 18)  we stopped here for lunch and some shopping. The service was great and the food was amazing. While I was hesitant to eat at a chain restaurant  I was glad we did. I had the Mediterranean Chicken tacos (amazing!) and my son and his friend had the chicken alfredo and chicken bacon ranch piadia - we were all happy and would definitely go back again.Make sure you sign up for the frequent member program and you'll get a free dessert cookie.
Oog B.,Pacifica  CA,0,76,,6/6/2017,2.0,Two stars mostly for the food  because it's not bad. But the cleanliness and services not good at all! I'm finally getting around to writing this  since I plan to every time I've been here. As usual  there's a weird dead smell upon entering  and lack of communication from the host makes things confusing. She said to wait  that someone was coming to seat us  so we did. Finally host and server speak and look around  I assume to decide who to seat first  although no one else was waiting. No smiles from anyone at all  so weird. Even as we were seated there was only a blank stare and monotone speaking. Employees here are like zombies. After repeating my order three times and having the server repeat it back incorrectly every time  I was ready to give up. It wasn't difficult  a salad with added chicken. I wasn't really in the mood to have such a difficult and weird nachos experience. I'll cross the street to Jacks next time.
Alex J.,Union City  CA,47,128,61,6/21/2016,2.0,The BJ's I've been to in the past have all been solid choices (not mind blowing but not disappointing either). This is the first BJ's that I've been to where I left unhappy. I went prior to a warriors game hoping to enjoy a beer and watch the warriors game. I called ahead to make sure I would be able to get a seat and was told that the wait was only 15 minutes. I reached the restaurant and was told that the wait would be 15 minutes (again). I left my contact number and received a text 1.5 hours after telling me that my table was ready. I came back to try the food and called ahead again and was told that another 15 minute wait would be ahead of me. My girlfriend placed her name on the call ahead list on the app and we were seated immediately (very strange). Once seated  the service was a little slow. We placed our order and the food arrived (slowly). We ordered the seared ahi salad  shrimp and asparagus penne  and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was small but good. The seared ahi dressing was a bit strong (if you do order  dressing on the side might be a smart choice). The shrimp and asparagus penne was strange; the it seemed like the dish was slopped onto the plate. I think they should have remade it because there were BLACKENED asparagus tips in the pasta (clarification: blacked on one side and green on the other side). Our waiter (who was a social butterfly and seemed to tend to the larger parties that were seated next to us) refilled our water  but I kept on noticing black specks in our water....they might have been using a Brita filter which would explain it  but nothing that i couldn't scoop out. But on a good note: Pazookies are good...yum....TL;DR: Not the best food...sometimes solid flavors but perhaps sloppily prepared with semi slow service...Pazkookies are the good point for all BJ's restaurants. I might recommend going to another BJ's location
Stefany Z.,San Francisco  CA,303,111,188,1/5/2016,1.0,"I\'ve been to this BJ\'s location plenty of times but never took the time to review it. However  this past Sunday I experienced the worst customer service I have ever received at a restaurant  it bothered me enough for me to share with everyone. Here\'s why I\'m giving it 1 star after this past visit:1) We waited 40 minutes to get seated on a Sunday night; we were a party of 3.2) Our server  ""ALEXIS C."" looked as grim as ever when greeting us. It was a forced  ""I hate my job"" kind of greeting. From the start I knew it was going to be a bad experience.3) We had to ask our server for everything  including plates for our appetizer  for which she looked bothered when asked.4) THERE WAS AN ANT ON MY PLATE. And the server didn\'t even bother to apologize.Honestly  I always tip regardless of terrible service...but this was just overwhelmingly bad. My friends felt sorry for the girl  so they tipped for our party. That server did not deserve a tip. No matter how shitty things are in your personal life  you\'re at work and if you want to earn a good tip  you should be a good server. Period."
Celine K.,Daly City  CA,0,7,1,9/20/2016,5.0,Awesome experience. The place had a buzzing atmosphere and busy  probbably what you'd expect from a Sunday night. The food was perfect  modest portions and speedy service which always makes for a better evening. While enjoying our food we met the manager Debbie young and super sweet woman. Debbie was spot on all night long  let us take our time looking over the menu  answered all questions quickly and well and was very complimentary towards everything .Ambiance at this local is pleasant  noise level is average  staff seems very efficient) food was good  prices decent. All in all  a very good dining experience and we will return.
Kristine S.,South San Francisco  CA,0,14,8,6/22/2016,1.0,Extremely slow service .. For takeout. They forgot the Bacon part of my Bacon burger  so I came back to get what they left out. Then ordered an appetizer because their portions are significantly smaller than I remember. It's been almost half an hour and still no appetizer or stuff that they forgot to put on my burger. They don't seem to have any urgency to update you or apologize that it's taking so long. Meanwhile the rest of the food is getting soggy and cold. Highly disappointed.The servers/hosts have no professionalism  they rather gather around the front counter and talk than pay attention.
Lauren W.,South San Francisco  CA,14,29,17,6/7/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"I swear  EVERYTIME I come here it\'s a problem. Last time  I was told a 20 minute wait.. I come in 25 mins later.. My food isn\'t even started being cooked. Because whoever took my order didn\'t think to mention the Santa Fe rolls are on recall  so they just changed my order to wings.. I walk up to pay and the lady says so what kinda wings you want? Confusing when I never ordered wings & a bit rude to not explain why your asking me about wings. I ask for s manager  he was very understanding and seemed to actually care about the customers feedback which was nice. I came back honestly because he was so genuine & seemed really concerned w/the well being of the staff & store  but god forbid BJs take care of my order properly. I come in tonight  my food was just sitting on the counter  not in the oven.. For 10 minutes while I waited to even be helped & another 8 for the girl to ""find"" the rest of my order. I asked the lady how long my food had been sitting out & she had hella attitude like ""Uhm only 5 minutes since I just walked up here 2 seconds ago.."" Meanwhile I was already waiting 15 minutes & saw my food sitting on the counter the entire time (just didn\'t know it was mine) I get home  they made me the wrong salad  my potato wedges were fried to a crisp with hardly any of the toppings  just Dry potato skin which is disgusting  they didn\'t give me the side of sour cream either. Plus when I called  I specifically asked them to make sure they were cooked properly b/c if I don\'t mention it there burned & dry. The SAME girl who had the attitude at the To go table is the girl who took my order & when I asked them to make sure it was cooked w/all the toppings she\'s like ""Obviously it will be on there if that\'s what comes with it or I can charge you for extra"" like obviously I wouldn\'t be asking for it to be cooked properly if there was no chance it would be cooked wrong. My boyfriend ordered an appetizer plate of chicken tenders yet they gave us a lunch order with fries which isn\'t what he asked for. The fries that came with it were so chewy & gross. Probably from sitting out for so long On top of all that horrible food  I figured there\'s no way they messed up my pizookie.. So I just threw my order in the trash & BOOM! My pizookie & my boyfriends pizookie were burnt. Hard as a rock. Even the ice cream wouldn\'t soften it up. Such a waste of $60 .. I would come back & tell the manager  but every time I come here it\'s like I have to talk to a manager or I won\'t get treated properly. If I\'m a paying customer I should just be treated kindly & have the proper food cooked. Of course slip ups happen. But it is EVERY TIME w/this location.Come to BJs throw your money away on burnt food & help yourself to some crap service & nasty attitude from the Take out girl  Verryy disappointing !!"
Brenda L.,San Francisco  CA,392,320,765,12/1/2015,3.0,This place falls right in the middle for me. Good for their craft beers and other selections on tap. Multiple screens to view the games and a good sized bar area (which is first come first serve). They also run certain hh specials during major televised games and parking isn't an issue (located in the tanforan shopping plaza)There really aren't many sports bar options around the area so it's probably your best bet after buffalo wild wings.The food is average - similar to an applebees. The quality is a hit or miss. The wings were fresh out the fryer one time I went and another time it was dry as cardboard. The clam chowder in the bread bowl was delicious - not the best clam chowder but definitely the best bread bowl I've had - baked with garlic butter - mmm. Skip the flatbreads - I've yet to find one that tastes good. The fries are thin shoe string fries - not my thing. The spinach artichoke dip was eh - the cheese looked like ricotta/ chunky and not really melted. Their craft brews are good - I like the hefeweisen and berry burst cider - the best thing is you can get a beer sampler which comes in 4 small flights - if you like variety this is a great option to sample 4 of their craft beers.The service has always been great so no complaints there. The multiple tv screen set up is pretty nice as well. Overall a good place to a grab a drink and watch the game. Don't set your expectations too high on the food however.
Aaron M.,San Francisco  CA,296,758,78,12/31/2015,4.0,"My parade of positive reviews of chain restaurants continues! Look  BJs has great pizza  and decent beer  and it\'s open even after your movie on the other end of the mall. The avocado egg rolls and the tuna poke are great too. If you order anything else you\'re really gambling and I don\'t know why you\'re doing it (or why they even let you  to be honest). Also  if you decide to (or have to) wait for a real table here  it could be awhile - snag seats at the bar if possible.The vegetarian toppings for the pizza are especially tasty  namely the ""seasoned tomatoes"" which is really just like the best chunky tomato sauce you\'ve ever had.  Mushrooms and black olives also work well.Oh! And they have an after-work happy hour on Fridays  a late happy hour after 10pm Sundays  and BOTH of them every other day of the week except Saturday when you get none. The mini pizzas and beers (which are the only things you should be getting here anyway) are heavily discounted. Do it."
Chiquita B.,New York  NY,0,1,,9/27/2016,1.0,It's really sad how Bjs has gone down in every way!!But thank you Andrew for stepping in.
Chrys S.,Burlingame  CA,250,333,681,4/13/2016,3.0,Good lunch specials but it is loud. Great stop if you want to catch a game on TV. Lots of TVs from every seating vantage point. It does get very busy at lunch. Ample parking since it is at Tanforan mall. But you can also get here via BART. The San Bruno station is just a hop and a skip away.The food is average American fare but they make their own root beer and have a vast array of beers on tap.It is a good option if you just need a standard meal and want to catch a game on TV.
Sandy V.,San Francisco  CA,49,27,32,10/17/2015,1.0,We got here at 4 o'clock we ordered five minutes later and now it is 4:55 and our. Food still not here.The people next to us got here fifteen minutes after us and they got their food already  and the worts thing is that the restaurant is not that busy.Forget this place this is our last time here very bad service.
Rachel R.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,42,8,5,11/28/2016,1.0,If I could give this place no stars I would. Not only did we have three different servers come tell us they were taking over for the other but none of them asked for our drinks until we were sitting down for ten minutes. Then when we did order they took forever to bring our food. Naturally we asked for ketchup and some extra sauces which did not come till we were all done eating. Our drinks were not refilled the entire meal and neither of the three servers who said they were taking our table checked on us. You would think that getting the check would be the easiest thing but they couldn't even get that to us. We eat out quite a bit and had friends with us from out of town. This was by far the worst service we have encountered. I would rather drive to another location than come back here.
Ringo M.,San Francisco  CA,540,299,912,10/29/2014,4.0,"It was Game 4 of the 2014 World Series and the Giants were in a dire situation down 4-1 by the end of the 3rd inning. It was at this trying time  with morale low and beer warm  that the KC Royals pitchers decided to do an Oprah imitation...""You get a HIT""""You get a HIT""""You get a HIT""""EVERY GIANT GETS A HIT!""Blanco  PANIKtime  MVPosey  Panda  PenceIntense  Belt  Perez  and my fave Giant Brandon Crawford (aka Jon Snow) all got hits! Suddenly  the beer was ice cold again  the pazookie sweet as ever  and I didn\'t even notice that there weren\'t enough cheese on the pizza. High fives were flying everywhere like Royals pop outs  and we were scoring runs faster than I could eat the Sampler. Some 20 TVs that surrounded the perimeters of BJ\'s were flashing a score that all of Bay Area wanted to see:""Giants 11  Royals 4""If you are considering BJ\'s for Game 7 tonight  I definitely recommend it. It\'ll take forever to get a table  but you can always grab a drink by the bar. Mike the bartender was helping me by the bar last time  and he was as awesome as the Giants victory. Time flies like a Home Run ball when you\'re watching the World Series and you\'ll get your table in no time.Here\'s to the Royals giving up hits like Oprah gave out cars for Game 7. GO GIANTS!!!!!"
Anh N.,SoMa  San Francisco  CA,17,29,19,11/23/2016,1.0,"I haven\'t been here in years and I now remember why I stopped going. Came with a group and they decided on BJ\'s. Wait time was over an hour to get seated. We get seated and there\'s no menus or utensils waiting for us. We had to grab them ourselves bc our server ran off somewhere. They forgot my daughter\'s meal  and her friend\'s meal and that took over an extra hour from when everyone started eating. The waitress said she ""forgot"" and apologized. What\'s the point in writing orders down and making that excuse. Also  when we had to check on the missing orders  we had to ask a different server - bc ours was no where in site. He had to place the order bc there was none made by her. I don\'t know why I came in expecting this place to be different  but I guess it did change- it got worse. If you have a LOT of time to spare  are with a small group and like to be literally left alone by any service- then come here."
Dawne L.,Castro Valley  CA,369,249,3987,10/21/2014,1.0,"I\'ve had a few work lunches here  but it\'s really more out of convenience then service or selection. However  our last lunch really pushed me to write this review. We made reservations for a big group for lunch hour and they sat us in the back. Ok-- that\'s good  some privacy for our team. Although that quickly turned more into neglect as we barely saw our server. When we did catch her  it was to remind her that 2 people have yet to get their food after 40 minutes of waiting as others finished their meal. Apparently  one of the dishes met an unfortunate accident. But as for the other one  she just totally missed. The manager did comp my friend a salad  but at that point  he was too hungry to care. Oh  and the ""reserved"" back seats were dirty when we got there -- I have pizza stain on my backside as proof. Crossing this off from our work lunch list!"
Alireza G.,Alcova  WY,3,11,2,2/3/2017,1.0,This place ruined bj's for me forever. 1. The wait was 1.5 hours when they said it was 30 min.2. The hostess just looked at our group and didn't say a word and expected us to read her mind. We didn't even know if she was showing us to our spot or another group. 3. Sat down and did't get helped helped for 17 minutes..4. Ordered and waters took another 7 minutes 5. Drinks came back and one was missing 6. Avocado egg rolls were great no complaints here7. Ordered side salads and they didn't come out... 8. After another 30 min we asked about them and she blamed the ticket getting lost 9. We got our pizza and salads at the same time  pizza was cold and not cut.10. No water refills DO NOT EAT HERE
Jasmine L.,Albany  CA,0,22,3,11/20/2016,1.0,Bad service  slow service  cold food  not seasoned. We had s party of eleven and 5 orders were messed up!
Kent S.,San Francisco  CA,52,61,6,7/8/2016,2.0,This is our go to place each week since it is close to our work. We have watched this place decline over the last three years. There are two waiters during the lunch period that are outstanding  the rest need to go.Food is slow to come out and many time the main entree comes out before the soup. salad etc. Waiters do not have certain areas with tables   but are roaming all over the place covering tables  it is very unorganized.We challenge the management of this place to contact us and let us share our experience with the restaurant etc. While we would hate to go to another venue  this place is becoming more of a 1 star venue than a 5.
Scott P.,Los Altos  CA,170,726,509,9/25/2015,2.0,Full disclosure  never a big fan of this chain  but went with a group from work despite my misgivings.I moderately enjoyed my one beer  their porter. Everything we ordered arrived at wildly different times and was delivered at a snail's pace.When we wanted the check split up  the server proceeded to complain about how difficult that would be for him. Our immediate reply was: every other place can do it. The server disappeared and the manager had to come take over. I didn't like that the server punted us to the manager instantly. We were nice and willing to assist the server in dividing the bill but he was not interested in communicating. The manager did manage to smooth things over  but I am still puzzled as to what the big deal was about?
Matthew L.,San Mateo  CA,608,460,3627,12/17/2014,3.0,Came here twice for lunch. Both times took over almost two hours...on a weekday. Service here can be kind of slow. It can take a long time to get water  and even longer for any alcoholic beverage to make it to your table. Definitely don't come here if you have an hour lunch...you're not going to be able to make it back to work in time!I've been to BJ's in other cities  and the food is comparable to the other locations that I've dined at. At this particular location  I had the country chicken steak  the seared ahi tuna salad  and the clam chowder in the bread bowl. All were pretty tasty - especially the seared ahi tuna salad  which was surprisingly good. The clam chowder was not bad either  although it tasted kind of like Progresso's canned chowder. Hopefully all the food they make is in-house and not anything canned or store bought.Parking can be a nightmare here  only because it's part of Tanforan Mall...so if it's busy with weekend (or holiday) shoppers  parking can be kind of difficult. The times I've come here I've had to park kind of far away... but I guess that might be a blessing in disguise since I can walk off a few extra calories with a farther away parking spot!Overall  this BJ's has a solid three star rating as it offers pretty good tasting food but with slow  slow service. If you plan to dine in  you should only come here if you have two or more hours to kill. Not recommended for a quick lunch break unless you're planning to order take out. Good luck!
Leslie C.,San Francisco  CA,26,84,1273,12/3/2015,3.0,This BJs is at Tanforan mall. It's a nice restaurant with a lot of TVs but the service is extremely slow. I ordered chicken wings ahead of time through their mobile app but still had to wait an hour for it after being seated. It was hard to get the waiter's attention to order our dinner and again for drinks. This BJs is a major disappointment.
Gabe T.,Hesperia  CA,1,33,3,2/20/2017,1.0,Horrific service and food poisoning received. My girlfriend and I were told a 20 minute wait and ended up waiting 35 minutes. It was no big deal but then we asked if we could ask for happy hour prices  the waiter was great but said he would ask the manager because we had an unexpected wait time; then the manager comes out and says she would comp an appetizer  which really confused us because we were looking to pay and had no complaint at first...she comps is wings and hours later we're having diarrhea and nausea. This place is a joke and now I see why the reviews suck.
Madison C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,2/20/2017,2.0,HORRIBLE SERVICE & SUB-PAR FOOD! Do not come here unless you want to wait over an hour just to be acknowledged and get water. I am usually a huge fam of BJ's but this one fell short. The waitress was extremely rude when we had to continuously ask for water and once we finally got our stuff we still got attitude because she was frustrated with us when we tried our best to organize our orders. Do not come to this BJ's unless you want to wait very long for your food.
Clemencia C.,Beachwood  OH,0,20,,4/3/2017,5.0,I was here with a large group of young students  and the team at BJ's was simply great! They were flexible  attentive  and made us feel very welcomed and cared for. Our space in the back was separate  and thus perfect for our group. They graciously accommodated some special requests (gluten-free  lactose-free). A terrific experience!
Ben L.,Burlingame  CA,22,225,193,4/24/2016,3.0,I don't come to this location very much. It was standard BJs. Not too busy for a Sunday afternoon. The pozookie's are still a good buy. The deep dish pizza is underrated but could use a little more sauce. I tried the hoagie sandwich. Not bad but I don't think I'd get it again. I don't like Dijon mustard  so make sure you tell them to switch out to normal French's mustard if that's your preference. Service was really good here.
Larry F.,Daly City  CA,28,36,16,12/20/2016,5.0,"I\'ve never written an Yelp review for this place  until now! They kept on asking me why I keep coming here and never reviewed. To put it simple  for all the times I eat out for lunch  mostly  and dinner  BJ\'s comes to the plate and deliver a consistent service and very few ""hiccups"" that I\'ve experienced in recent visits to other restaurants. Prices are reasonable and menu is robust. Will come again!"
Janelle M.,South San Francisco  CA,52,74,558,9/16/2016,3.0,Always come here for a last resort thing if I'm at the mall. Food is alright  but the place is starting to smell like stale beer  I think they need to deep clean their carpets.
Nicole A.,San Bruno  CA,0,6,,8/2/2016,4.0,We've eaten here quite a few times. Always a bit of a wait to be seated  usually quite busy. Food is good though  I've never had an issue. We've ordered to go 2 times from their website which could use some improvement but overall I'm not sure why this place is being rated so poorly.
Elle C.,Milpitas  CA,37,37,8,5/31/2016,1.0,"My daughter had a show nearby last December and we wanted to celebrate with our family that drove out to see her. BJ\'s closes late and can fit a large amount of people so we decided to come here. Biggest mistake! By their wait staff\'s behavior they obviously dislike each other and hate their jobs.We arrived at 9pm and got seated closer to 11pm. They kept saying 20 minutes  20 minutes. If they just told the truth we could have gone somewhere else. A few of my family members that drove 1 1/2 hours had to leave before we were seated because it was getting so late. We finally get seated and placed our drink order and waited 15 minutes for that. When our waitress came to take our food order another waitress came by and said she was slow and she can help but our waitress was salty and told her to bounce. We waited another 45 minutes before our food finally came out. She rarely came to our table to check on us but she was very attentive to a table across from us. While we waited for our drinks to be refilled a male waiter was passing by and my son said ""excuse me"" to get someone\'s attention. That male waiter kept walking and said ""I don\'t work here"" but entered the kitchen. Ew.We finally got the attention of another male waiter who started checking on us because our chic wasn\'t. He got our dessert order but got it wrong and we waited another 30 minutes for that and then another 30 minutes for our bill. We were frustrated with waiting and for being ignored we were complaining to each other about the horrible service. The male waiter that supposedly didn\'t work there and another one were sitting at a booth nearby giving us nasty looks for complaining. By the time we left it was almost 1am.Never ever again. My daughter has another show coming up in July and this time we won\'t be coming here nor would I recommend it to any of the 100+ performers and our 900 guests."
Rosallie B.,Half Moon Bay  CA,0,7,,5/24/2017,5.0,Came in on a Tuesday right before the dinner rush. Did not have to wait for seating for a table of four. Anthony was our server and he did an excellent job  he made sure are drinks were filled  also checked back to the table often  overall great customer service. Food was delicious! And very prompt the appetizer and the kids meal were delivered a couple minutes within ordering them. Would come here again!
Debbie S.,San Bruno  CA,143,54,11,6/18/2016,1.0,I would give this place a BIG FAT ZERO if the option was available. YOU MUST READ MY REVIEW FOR YOUR SAFETY! Considering I live in San Bruno  I've only come here three times and the last time I was here was three times too many. When they first opened  I ordered a salad and wanted steak on it (steak salad). Well I was charged for a large salad plus charged for a steak dinner. Their reasoning was that a steak salad was not on their menu. Well now it is. Maybe my complaint made it to the top. Second time  it took 15 mins to get attended to by a server and 35 min wait for our food. The last time I was here  I ordered the Chicken tortilla soup at 11Am when they first opened as I had a business lunch meeting. It was convenient. I took my first bite and on my second bite something scraped and stabbed my tongue as I forced to keep from swallowing it. OMG! It was a SHARP PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS! Called the server and told her to go to the kitchen and not to serve the soup to anyone then I told her to get her manager. Filled out an incident report since the glass cut my tongue. They did not charge me for my meal BUT NEVER ASKED ME IF I WANTED SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT. So my lunch meeting turned into a water drinking meeting. Then the server had the nerve to tell me that I was still welcome to leave anything behind for her?????!!!!!!????? Really! Corporate office sent me a $50 gift certificate. My tongue was sore and swollen for 10 days and I received $50. What a joke! BJ's San Bruno is only good for their beer and TV's. I will NEVER be back to this BJ's.
Star_smog T.,South San Francisco  CA,34,4,10,2/11/2017,5.0,Very nice place. My wife and I went there few days ago. We had a great time and delicious food. Price wise is average. I strongly recommend a place for a good date.
Lin G.,Cherry Hill  NJ,0,3,,5/30/2017,1.0,Terrible service. Very limited gluten-free...unreliable protocol for cross-contamination. We were given food with no utensils. Stopped waiters going by to ask. Asked for manager twice. Finally got forks  with one knapin used. Manager finally brought knives. Food got cold. I took a chance on a supposedly gf quinoa dish. Didn't feel well afterwards. Two family members ordered jambalaya  and one was too salty to eat. I was visiting CA from NJ. I must seek out places that do gf well  and go to places that have gf options on menu. Manager comped the meal due to terrible service  but I'm never going back there. One waiter we asked for silverware walked off and promptly started horsing around inappropriately (groping!) with a female waitress  in clear view  in addition to ignoring our need for flatware.
Irving S.,San Francisco  CA,17,26,15,9/9/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,We waited for 1 hour for our food and the food was cold. I really don't understand how anybody can actually like this place  I guess they don't know what good food is. I'm trying to give this place a chance The owner is a cheap sob not to hire and extra waiter. I can't even pay the bill and still here waiting.The toilets are very dirty and people don't flush the toilet horrible place
Jon T.,San Francisco  CA,108,10,4,12/14/2016,1.0,I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip as a starter. The dip had a layer of oil settled on the top and the nachos were soaked in the oil that it was fried in I couldn't even finish because it was so greasy. The deep dish pizza (if you can even call it that) tasted like it was from pizza hut with the crispy oily crust and one thin layer of toppings. The opened faced late night burger with the chile verde was a weird combo and the two flavors just didn't go well together. When I lifted the bun off the plate it was glistening and dripping with grease. The meal was quite disappointing and I definitely won't be going back for the food.
LoveFood W.,San Francisco  CA,239,47,2,12/22/2016,1.0,This review is based on just the clam chowder. It was so heavy and creamy and way too salty. For being house-made  it did not meet my expectations. It tasted like it came out of a can.
Jamie B.,Chandler  AZ,282,404,692,4/30/2016,3.0,Food was great  but the service was a bit slow for lunch service. Also the hostess was a taken back because we did not want to site outside in the mall patio.
Christine A.,Santa Barbara  CA,8,21,5,12/19/2016,4.0,When you walk into a BJs  you know what to expect. While the kitchen staff was terribly slow  our wonderful server made up for it. He was so sweet and super attentive  he made the experience that much better. If a manager reads this  please give props to Mario H.  he was awesome.
Kimberly S.,San Francisco  CA,2,49,,6/17/2016,4.0,I love BJ's Resturant over in Tanforan Mall. It's a convenient place to grab a bite before seeing a movie or just wandering around the shops walking off some of the calories! We've had lots of waiters over the years but Mark G  Shay and Briana are just my absolute favs! They always greet us with a smile and never rush us or our order. We always feel like we're around friends when we go here. Just wanted to give a shout out so Management knows they've got some great people working the floor! We are lucky enough to have time off during the week so we can go when it's not super swamped and have a minute or two between appetizers and the main course to have some friendly convos with them when the restaurant isn't busy and they stop by the table to see if we need anything.The food at BJ's seems to change every now and then  but you can always find something tasty on the menu. The beers are obviously a focal point and I like the darker end of the taps  but that's neither here nor there. (The new derby cobb salad is pretty darn good and not pre-tossed like the last one  so there's a plus!!!) I wish they had growlers to go  but .... they don't. I guess it's because they don't brew on site - except for their sodas  I think.Unless they do something awful with the service or food  I'll always choose it first over Hooters or the food court on the other side of the mall!Do yourself a favor and sign up for the rewards program  take advantage of their smartphone app and try grabbing a pizza to go - every aspect of their service is great.
Andria C.,Fresno  CA,129,6,,1/3/2017,1.0,If you like warm food  don't come here. Waiter wasn't attentive  messed up our order (it never got received to the kitchen so we waited an extra 30 minutes for food). AND the kitchen gave me my food ice cold (I ordered a burger). Waste of time.
Nicole S.,Brisbane  CA,6,47,,3/27/2016,2.0,The service is always bad  and it takes forever for the food to come out. The food is mediocre at best.We had the clam chowder  and it was lurk warm. The ahi tuna salad was bland as well.I don't know how this place is always packed.
Iris B.,San Francisco  CA,0,11,,5/18/2017,5.0,I made dinner reservations for a high-school baseball team of 20 and a group of 12 parents. We arrived early but Efraim  the manager on duty  was able to quickly accommodate us. I believe he helped with setting the tables and designated one or two waitresses for our party only. They were friendly and patient and available when we wanted something. Everyone was served in a timely manner and there were no mistakes with the orders. The food was good  something for everyone  and Efraim stopped by to make sure everything was to our liking. Upon our way out he came to say goodbye and thank us for our visit. Super service  great food. Thank you!
Janeth L.,Novi  MI,32,2,,7/1/2016,1.0,The service was horrible! They never checked on you  never refill our waters  and had to wait over half hour for food when the restaurant wasn't even busy at all! The food was tasteless  lukewarm  and messy. It looked like someone's leftovers that they didn't want and tasted just like that. I will never come back to this place! Complete disappointment.
Marie Antoinette L.,Broadmoor  CA,157,8,1,12/30/2016,1.0,I ordered pizza for pick up here  took it home & ate it. After already eating most of it I found a strand of hair that was deeply baked in my pizza. The most gross thing ever! Ever since then I never came back.
Jess M.,Corona  CA,4,9,4,11/29/2016,1.0,Worst service here. I came here after a flight and waited ten minutes at my booth before I was even greeted by my waiter. I had to get up and find someone who was sitting on a counter to get my server. There were easily ten employees that walked by without any regard to me as I say waiting. Needless to say  if I wasn't so hungry I would have left. So disappointed in the service here. No thanks!
Courtney C.,San Bruno  CA,327,23,9,12/12/2016,2.0,The service is always awful. They're slow  forget stuff  and it seems like they just don't care. I do like their berry burst cider and pazookies but it's honestly not worth the wait.
Mary S.,Auburn  CA,2,15,,6/10/2016,2.0,I've been BJs at least a hundred times over many years at six locations in the Western US. This is hands down the most unusual and worst BJs location I've been to. The service is slow and the waitstaff seems to care less. There was a new guy training tonight (with potential to be great)  but service tonight was on par with the reviews...bad. The kitchen needs work also. It took over twenty minutes for my two appetizers to be served. The guacamole was good  but it was served with stale chips. Chicken lettuce wraps tasted good  but chicken was served in big chunks...it's usually cut up into small centimeter cubes to make it easier to eat with the lettuce leaves. Sad.
Tanya O.,Montclair  CA,4,15,153,8/21/2016,1.0,Rude waiter  never coming back. Had to ask for silverware  never checked in on us  slow service...
Kevonna M.,Redwood City  CA,18,1,,1/5/2017,1.0,Waiter was not on point at all! Brought us cold fries twice and put everything on my food i told them not to. Do not waste your time or money here you've been warned.
Lisa H.,San Francisco  CA,169,60,63,2/21/2016,1.0,This place has the absolute worst service ever to be known in the world. What restaurant has 1200k+ reviews and still remain at 2 stars?!! Currently sitting here after waiting 15+ minutes to have our drink orders taken and when the waitress finally arrives  she was not even the slightest apologetic. It's understandable if she was busy but at least acknowledge our existence and let us know if you plan on coming to our table. This place is only good because of its hours and its prices for the amount of food. Don't bother coming here any other time of the day  it'd only ruin your day.
Grace M.,San Jose  CA,199,35,7,4/29/2016,1.0,Pay with cash don't use a card!It's BJs  a classic with mediocre service and decent food and desserts but this location has lost my business. Our service was almost non existent from the start. We only saw our original server in the beginning and assumed she went on break or something when a new server (who looked under the influence) came back after we were done and gave us the check and took the card for payment. .  The transaction took longer than normal which I thought everyone here was just slow due to the service we received  but within the next week I received fraudulent charges on the card I used there. It was a card infrequently used and the only place where the card was out of my sight. I didn't want to post if I was wrong  but just recently a friend had a mentioned how his card got fraud charges after paying at BJs this location with a card. This was too much to be coincidence so watch your cards and be careful when it's out of you sight!
Nerissa D.,Daly City  CA,90,142,824,8/3/2014,3.0,Had to take girls for dinner and BJs was the pick of the night. Food is ok! The pizza was just ok. Clam chowder was a tiny bit salty for my taste although it's very filling Service- we had several ppl and one of them was pretty helpful. Our waiter was attentive and apologetic for keeping us waiting If it's crowded see if you can just grab a table near the bar area. It's first come first serve. We saw ppl waiting for tables and when we walked in we found a table and say down. We are done w dinner and I see ppl still we airing for their table.
Yosof R.,Daly City  CA,1,21,52,7/14/2015,4.0,This review is a sum up of all the times coming here. First off  its a good location to meet if youre in the peninsula area for food. Next to mall and near freeway exits. The food is usually good  nothing special or a must have here. The soups should have MORE in he bowl but whatever. The better reason I dont even complain is usually because the waitresses are young and cute here. The one girl i got the other day could of been more of a talker but she was so broad. She needs to tell her boo thang to hit it right. The host was banging! Pretty face and bbw  damn. I wanna take her out but she might get it all the time. On another note  be careful who is sitting next to you. I get the feeling ex felons and drug dealers come here for their sit downs. Speak soft. Mind your own business.
Sandra H.,Bayview-Hunters Point  San Francisco  CA,66,4,,11/16/2016,1.0,"Used to love this place. But don\'t give your seat up to a single guy when you\'re chilling with your boys. As soon as they see you are not alone  they decide to disrespect you and call you every name in the book. Best part of it all  the manager Andrew (or whatever his ""real name is"" (good job on hiring practices BJs) tells you that you are kicked out for standing up for yourself. Wow!!!!!!!"
Mary-Helen A.,Daly City  CA,167,108,12,4/26/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I'm back... I barley go here and most of the time I don't have a problem  but I took my son out here today for his 5th bday. food was good! Our server on the other hand... He was missing ol not once asked how we was. I asked a few other severs for things including the check 3 times! Over heard the others asking where he was... No where to be found. well I mean that not my problem but we were scheduled to watch a movie after BUT now we missed it because of the lack of our server... honestly  it's not only the servers but it wasn't a full full house so managers be on top of your toes and keep watch of your staff. because customers like me would complain  I just didn't have the time to.
Wayne Y.,Daly City  CA,0,12,3,4/23/2017,1.0,Ordered Gourmet Five Meat Deep Dish pizza. The only taste is salt. Ordered Crispy Calamari. The portion was really small; you can fit the calamari into a small McDonald's french fry bag. The calamari was barely warm  and was soggy  not crispy.
Jill S.,San Leandro  CA,5,23,3,1/28/2016,2.0,Dined here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend & siblings.Service was slow & inattentive. *Unusual  it was not busy for a weekend night*Waited about 40 mins to get seated  (Used the text app to get alerts of when a table is available). We were finally seated  & got our drinks promptly.. But I felt like we had to wait another 30-40 mins just to place our order! So  by that time  our drinks are gone. about another 30 mins after we finally placed our orders  home-girl comes back around asking how we're doing & if there is anything else we need.. I mean  if you see all these empty cups on the table  and STILL WITHOUT FOOD... Yes darling  We're just F*CKN PEACHY. um  maybe a new server would be nice.Yeah  wouldn't come back here unless I don't have a choice.
Jenny L.,Jamestown  CA,0,5,,12/28/2016,2.0,This was my first BJ's experience and also my last.. service was poor due to our waiter watching the football game on tv instead of doing his job. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.. very dry.. my friend had the bacon cheeseburger with avocado  nothing special. They are overpriced for such poor tasting food.
Angeline M.,Martinez  CA,28,2,,12/11/2016,1.0,Maybe I'm just not a fan of BJ's. We were in the area and craved for their chicken wings (we usually go to the BJ's in Concord). However  our wings were super dry! We also ordered poke  pasta w/ meatballs and they tasted horrible! Brussel sprouts was ok though.. Service was very slow too... Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!
Cassie S.,South San Francisco  CA,269,1,1,3/12/2016,5.0,The food here was amazing. My omelette was perfectly shaped and well put together. Definitely recommend BJ's brunch menu. Our sever Russell was great as well. Greeted us right away and anticipated our guest needs very well. Definitely going back!
Bing W.,Daly City  CA,94,32,8,5/9/2016,1.0,Things have really gone downhill at BJ's and its no surprise to see so many bad reviews. Just went there today for lunch and stood in front of the hostess counter to get a table for 5 minutes without even being acknowledged. There were two hostesses there just chatting it up and didn't even care that customers were waiting on them. It's like BJs management just hires people for the hell of it and aren't supervised so these people are getting paid to socialize. Lucky them. After being ignored  I just found a seat at the bar instead. Service was slow as usual  tables sticky/unclean  and the menu is now a disaster. It seems as if BJs is trying to mimic cheesecake factory's menu but failed miserably. Ordered the new baked ziti dish and the bottom of the dish is literally all oil. I understand maybe some oil due to the cooking process  but the pasta was floating in oil. To say that least  I highly doubt I'll be going back. There are other places in the area that are at least cleaner and hostess more professional.
Merie M.,Marina  CA,23,9,1,5/8/2016,1.0,Kinda of disappointed. Chicken lettuce wrap... Not what I had expected. I've been to several BJs and I'm sure that they use ground chicken. The food wasn't satisfying. Not worth it here... I also ordered the calamari  the sauce was all over the plate. What waste of my money. They can do better- common guys- get it together like the other BJs
Lyz A.,San Francisco  CA,119,7,2,4/21/2015,1.0,"I had a moth in my salad- enough said. It\'s little tiny legs were still moving sprawled upside down with its wings lodged in my watermelon feta salad. We told our server and she shrieked with disgust. She said don\'t worry I\'ll take care of it... We got the bill  nothing was taken off. My boyfriend approached her and she apologized and took off fukn 4 dollars off the bill! Really!!? 4 dollars? My boyfriend told her to put herself in our shoes and she replied with ""I\'m a server"" what does that even mean? You see these dirty critters creeping around all the time in your restaurants food? On top of the unsanitary facility  the service was slow for a Sunday night at 830pm. Even when the busser said its a really slow night. Make a choice  come here or not- just be careful and make sure you check your food before you put it in your mouth becaus"
Jes W.,Oceanside  CA,18,30,,9/25/2016,1.0,I debated writing this review. We were in last night and I gave it a day to consider. I decided to write it because if I can save someone some cash  I'd like to. We came in last night for dinner and had apps and dinner. Food was subpar  but the server would never know since we barely saw him. It was the worst service I've ever had. I've never contemplated leaving no tip before last night  but I couldn't do that. I was under the impression that if you were a bar server  you had to be a phenomenal employee? We were never checked in  never got refills for drinks  and still spent $57. Unreal. Save your money  go somewhere else. And please BJ's  retrain your service staff.
Margarita L.,San Francisco  CA,58,18,8,4/30/2016,2.0,Steak sirloin burn from outside and raw from inside  kids cheese burger old lettuce and tomatoesServices the stupid waitressOverall not worth it
Leilani Z.,Lake Forest Park  WA,704,3,,10/28/2016,2.0,"I know how the restaurant industry works  so I try to be as patient as I can at restaurants. My experience at this location was very poor. We sat in the open seating bar area around 4pm and didn\'t get greeted until 413. Before then I had to get up and grab menus myself from the host. Since we knew what we wanted right away  we ordered with our first waiter. I get this is transition time  so 10 mins later the same server came by and introduced us to Lovely and said she will be taking care of us. Cool  no problem. We should be getting our drinks in 5 mins now. Nope. Add another 10 mins and we finally got our first order of drinks. For the rest of our evening our server checked in with us maybe every 15 mins. Or was at least in the same vicinity every 15 mins. So when I wanted to order my last drink  I had to bother a different server with a different section to have our server see us. I am not familiar with this menu  and on the first page of beers it shows one stout. I figured you guys only offered one stout so I ordered ""one stout please."" It wasn\'t the one I thought I was getting. My server should have specified which stout I wanted... Unless she is just new? She should ask what kind especially for beers  or any kind of alcohol that has different flavors with its (example  beer) family. To me  this problem is the same as me ordering ""one beer please""... Obviously the waiter/bartender would respond  ""which kind?"" Also  I know I could have approached my server to solve this solution but it wasn\'t until I got my bill that I realized the stout situation. Overall  I\'ll still come to a BJ\'s  but never this location again. Although this leaves me skeptical that other locations have this same inattentive service...."
Tamara W.,Lee's Summit  MO,0,1,,4/30/2017,2.0,BJs is a busy place. The staff is nice and was extremely busy. The food was fair to ok. I ordered a well done bacon cheddar burger. The burger was pink throughout on an oversized bun with hints of aged lettuce. On the plus side  the Jamison Amber Ale was good.
Shannon C.,San Mateo  CA,191,68,117,10/5/2015,4.0,Going to try and make this review quick. Came here twice.Both times food was good. I could do without the lemon zest chicken though. The buffalo wings are the best.First time I went  the waiter was absolutely terrible. I don't remember his name but he literally looked completely out of it. (-1 for that)Second time  the waiter was much better. He was helpful and nice. It was around 10pm when I came with my family and I was really happy to see that people didn't look annoyed that they were working a night shift. Go you guys.Overall  probably would come back.
Rochelle M.,Half Moon Bay  CA,88,118,177,6/16/2015,3.0,A great sports bar to meet up with friends and also a great place to have lunch with family. The food was ok  the pizookie was good and great to share with others. The staff was attentive and friendly. It took awhile for our food to arrive but it wasn't too long  maybe 25min at most. The fries I was a bit disappointed in. They are super thin and oily. I got more a bite of oil than fries. The burgers are good but also a bit greasy. Can't complain  I'll be coming back if I can't find a place to eat.
Ellie V.,South San Francisco  CA,6,15,3,11/18/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Really disappointing. Came in for dinner before a fun movie. Mozzarella sticks were cold. Potato skins weren't fully melted and also not hot. Endless wait for dessert. Server kept disappearing. The bathroom was a swamp. But hey at least the check came. Before the dessert??? Not sure it's worth coming back after this one.....
Vicky H.,Millbrae  CA,118,143,425,7/15/2014,4.0,"We went to BJ\'s for FIFA World Cup Final on Sunday morning  arrived around 11am and got ourselves seated at the bar area  right in front of the big screen TV. :D The bar tender/server introduced himself as Keith as we browsed through the menu almost as thick as a ""textbook"" (similar to the size at Cheesecake Factory). We found Keith being personable and put in an effort to engage in a conversation  asking which team we support and how we\'d see the outcome of the match. He maintained a smile at all times. We appreciated his courteous service and friendliness as he still attended to us given the chaos and packed crowd that later gathered and surrounded the bar area once the match began. At BJ\'s  their traditional wings are to die for  an appetizer I highly recommend. I also prefer their Great White pizza since I am not a big fan of red sauce. From their own line of brews  I\'ve always liked Jeremiah Red  an ale that is rich in flavor but not overly bitter  as well as Nutty Brunette  a chocolate-flavored dark ale  delicious! One funny incident worth mentioning is that the guy who sat next to me at the bar area wasn\'t from the neighborhood and it was his first time visiting BJ\'s. He was totally impressed by the menu selection (he ""studied"" for quite a while) and said it could be a dangerous place should he come more often. I could tell he was quite happy with the experience even though the team he cheered for ultimately lost--sorry Argentina!Overall  it was one good FIFA Final experience and kudos to Keith for the good service provided. I am glad that the crowd wasn\'t overly rowdy or obnoxious as people could get emotional cheering and rooting for their favorite team to bring home the trophy. :) It is a fun sports bar and restaurant to watch a game. One tip: Get there at least an hour EARLIER to secure better seating for big events like World Series  Super Bowl  etc. :P"
Scott L.,South San Francisco  CA,105,58,40,3/6/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Tom  the GM  immediately took care of the situation. The kitchen manager came out as well and they brought out an order that was made to perfection. It's amazing how better something tastes when made properly. It was night and day. If those boneless wings come out correctly each time  they will be my new favorite item. Like I'd said before  I hated leaving that review. There are amazing people who work here and I love coming back for good food  good beer  and good company. Faith restored.
Terry S.,Daly City  CA,80,153,112,10/18/2016,3.0,As much as I like BJ's  be forewarned of take out when ordering bowls of soup. This place is a big rip off when it comes to that. They really short change you with take out and barely give you 6 oz. What a jip
Katie P.,Daly City  CA,438,100,233,5/4/2015,4.0,I'm personally not a big fan of American... type Fried Food but BJ for sure one of those that are worth going back again. *Service: our waitress was the best! Her name is Xinia and she super nice. We had small conversations here and there and although she was super busy busting other tables  she still stayed a few minutes here and there just to chat with us. She always had a big smile on.*Food: We ordered a bunch of appetizers. My friend ordered this American Burger but turned out to be sandwich bread instead of burger buns  which I find odd. The Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wrap is really good  especially that sweet tangy sauce they have. We also ordered fried calamari and it was so crispy...! My favorite was that Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. We asked for extra jalapenos and it was just the BEST. The fries were soft and adding that cheese + jalapenos ... *drool. I can just eat the whole thing myself!*Atmosphere: super chill. It is that perfect sports bar but with lots of food along with it too. They have dim lights with lots of TVs channeled to different sports channel. Big booths with also good ground tables

Anne R.,Hercules  CA,5000,810,318,3/22/2015,3.0,Possibly one of worst customer service experiences ever. Came here pretty late and an hour about closing time so you would think service would be better  even though it was busy. We got seated right away and our server greeted us and asked for our drink order and shortly after we ordered our our meals. I will also add that the bjs menu is really large so you have plenty of options to choose from! Once we got our food  which was pretty good by the way  our waiter was never to be seen again. We waited around for about 40 minutes or so after wards and he still didn't come around  not even to refill our drinks. We he finally showed up to help the table across from us  we asked for the bill and he apologized for the wait as it had been busy. Overall  the food was good and the place was large and full of life but the service could have been much better as it was a bit on the slower side and the waiters didn't show much interest in the customers at all. So would I return? I would give it another chance because the food was that good but hope that customer service returns.There is plenty of parking as there is a parking lot right in front of the restaurant.
Saurabh C.,Burlingame  CA,0,21,6,7/18/2015,3.0,Good food  good service and overall a good experience.We all liked our food. The pasta  the soup and the flatbread were all satisfactory. My friend liked the beer he selected.Our server was very  very polite and took good care of us.What I hated was that two out of our six water glasses were extremely dirty (thankfully from the outside.) My friend's flatware was dirty  too but he got it exchanged.I do not understand how any place can slip up in something as basic as clean utensils? Makes one think how they wash them in the first place. If I go here again  at some point in the future  and I see clean utensils with everything else remaining the same  I might add another star.
Caitlin T.,East Oakland  Oakland  CA,287,37,39,2/13/2016,1.0,"Wow. Terrible experience. Food tasted as if it were made out of a box - I mean completely unpalatable. Mashed potatoes were tragic. ""Italiano penne pasta"" was confused. Calamari was rubbery. Sent one dish back. I could\'ve made better food at home. Needless to say  I will NEVER come back to this location. They totally ruined it for me."
Fiona B.,San Francisco  CA,1,45,109,10/27/2015,3.0,Walked in and staffs was kind of talking amongst themselves  they saw me but didn't say anything. Same time  a family of 3 came in  they were slow to greet them as well  but they were seated first even though I came in before them. This guy seated us  walked reallllllllllllly slow and allllllllllllllll the way to the back even though the front had seats  and our section smelled like garbage.Service was slow  waited 8 minutes til a waitress came to give us the menu and ask what we would like to drink. Another 5 minutes pass  we ordered. Waited for 15 to 20 minutes for the food and the food was just okay. . . Couldn't wave down any other waiter to get the bill. I don't know if I'll ever go back  unless if friends go there or I'm desperate 
Ashley F.,San Jose  CA,0,11,,5/28/2016,4.0,Here waiting .... I understand it's busy but lack of communication is the issue.. The waiter walks by 15 times looks at us and keeps walking ordered the drinks 30 mins later they come and 2 is missing 15 mins later they come and we order apps I had to ask the guy 30 mins after to please take our order. We have no silver ware menus are sticky! And are waiter just says he is busy! I mean I worked at a restraunt and this is just insane. Drinks are empty and still waiting for food. Such awful service ! Update!!!!! The Gm tom got my alert and came over to apologize to me and my party. The fact that he took the time to completely apologize and help out with our order. They were busy and I understand that. Thank you so much the fact that you recognized the issue and took time out of your duties to help us with our order was completely nice of you. Thank you Tom!Ashley
Tara A.,San Francisco  CA,1503,434,1140,5/16/2014,3.0,Came here for takeout on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy  but we got our food in around 15 minutes. I was a little irritated though because they got my pizookie order wrong... And I was really excited for the one I got haha (that seems bratty.. oh well). We ordered:Avocado eggrolls: my favorite!! I love them both here and at the Cheesecake Factory. They give you 3 big eggrolls and they are cut in half  so you can definitely share! They come with a sweet tamarind sauce that goes really well with the avocado.Hawaiian mahi mahi: Pretty disappointed in this dish. I think I paid $15 for it and the fish portion definitely did not look like it was worth $15!!! Maybe like... $7 lol. And that's being generous! The fish was also pretty dry and I didn't taste the soy glaze that it said it came with. However  the pineapple fried rice that came with this was delicious and made up for the lack of taste in the fish!Chicken bacon ranch pizza: Cute personal sized pizza. Didn't really taste the ranch so I wish it came with extra ranch for dipping hahahaChoc chip pizookie: Pretty standard  very delicious and soft even after we took it for takeout. We ended up putting it in the toaster oven to heat up and it was perfect! Still had crunchy edges and a soft inside. It was smart of them to give a separate container for the ice cream too. Only downside of this was that I actually ordered cookies and cream!!!!!!! :( Was so disappointed when we saw that it was chocolate chip.... Sigh.... Prob won't get over it until I actually get my cookies and cream pizookie lol.Only 3 stars because I was really disappointed with the fish for that price. All the other food deserves 4 stars! This place is pretty pricey thoguh.
John C.,San Jose  CA,102,95,3,9/27/2016,3.0,I stopped in for a quick lunch. Sat at the bar and had a nice French Dip with grilled onions  mushrooms  and Swiss cheese. Served with shoe string onions.It was pretty good. A l;ittle peppery  but I enjoyed it
Jeannie T.,Milpitas  CA,62,65,20,2/5/2016,5.0,I always have dinner at BJ's  so it's obvious that their food is amazing  but what makes me give this review a 5 stars is the server we had. AL was phenomenal! He took on a huge party of 40 for a gender reveal party on a busy Saturday afternoon! Not only did he get our orders correctly  but we looked forward to conversing with him the whole time we were there. If you go to BJ's  hopefully you get to sit where AL is serving. He should get promoted wink wink
Xuan C.,San Francisco  CA,1669,368,402,6/5/2016,5.0,Their fried calamari is really good. Tuesday they have half off their wine collection. Needed it since being in the hair industry is stressful.
Cassidy P.,Burlingame  CA,125,2,,11/29/2016,1.0,C'mon bjs. Terrible bar service. I know there was 6 of us but our server could not be bothered. Again  I know it's busy and the bar is complicated but we got fully ignored. Seriously terrible. Good food and good happy hour horrible service.
Tracy C.,San Francisco  CA,98,53,6,5/7/2015,4.0,Made a takeout order a few days ago: a half sandwich lunch special w/ fries and tomato mozzarella salad. When I picked it up and brought it back  my fries weren't in there! I sent in an email complaint just to let them know  and the next day Crystal  a manager  gave me a call and offered to offer my next meal free of charge. When I came back today  the manager John came out (Crystal told me she'd be out the day I wanted to come) and personally apologized and thanked me for coming in  and made sure to double check that everything in my order was there. Sure  BJs isn't the most upscale of restaurants  but I do appreciate the attention they took to rectifying the small mistake. The great customer service did not go unnoticed  and I'll definitely be back for more take out orders.
Carol C.,Newhall  CA,76,17,5,1/8/2016,4.0,Me and my friends always have gone to bjs to hangout and celebrate after grueling exams and also just for casual evenings. We have always had great service. So when a family friend wanted to go out for their birthday we suggested this place. When checking in at the front we experienced a customer service hiccup that left us feeling a sour taste in our mouth  but when bringing it to the managers attention he was apologetic and quick to address it. Our waitress Jessica was awesome and so nice ! She was very attentive and always kept us hydrated. The food was good as usual and the best part was that we got to watch the basketball game on top of the birthday dinner. I would go again and would still recommend this place to others :)
Kim C.,Pacifica  CA,1,27,53,10/16/2016,1.0,Friend suggested this place. For some reason I really didn't want to but decided to just go. Very minimal service. Asked for the strongest drink on the menu and it was watered down. Calamari was extremely salty. My burger had no sauce in it so it was super dry. No mayo no ketchup or mustard. Just dry. It came with fries that tasted old and stale. I asked for ranch and it was just as watered down as my drink. I should've went with my gut and suggested a different place. Was not worth it eating here
Bianca G.,Daly City  CA,143,4,4,4/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,They need to get nicer workers. Every time I come here  someone got an attitude. And they ALWAYS take forever with everything. Forever to take our order. Forever to get our food
Aliza W.,San Leandro  CA,83,65,38,4/2/2017,1.0,this BJs needs some work . The wait was okay . The service needs work as well im not sure if they were understaffed but just a little work on that maybe the experience would have been better . Our waiter kept forgetting about our table and he got our order wrong as well . Eventually the manager came to help him . The food was okay . I got a vegan soup which was nice and hearty and a hot tea   great for a cold night .
Ken W.,Sunnyvale  CA,119,181,1031,4/30/2014,4.0,Get a pizookieNuff said.
M Andrea M.,Bakersfield  CA,0,3,,11/12/2016,1.0,Where do I start? When we entered there was no one to greet us  there was NO clean tables and the ones that were clean were closed  the bartender couldnt recommend a good fruity drink so he handed me a novel which is the menu and.its printed so small you cant read it. Now we have been to many BJs especially Stockton where the food is AWESOME and so is the service. We finally got a table with no help from the staff and was ready to order  OUR Server Rob showed up with the brightest smile and personality which made things much more bearable. The bathroom was disgusting and no stalls had toilet paper. This was the worse experience ever.
Kelly B.,Daly City  CA,183,1,,11/9/2016,1.0,I usually never write reviews but tonight nick the dick deserve this one! I ordered a medium rare steak and got medium well.... when I told him to it was wrong he disappeared for a good hour and a half . Not only was my order wrong but the whole party's order was wrong. He wasn't around much to help us fix it. He didn't come to check on us. Another server is now taking care of us. We got here at 5:30 and it's now 8:32 and we are currently here because NICK sucked. We were sitting here for a good hour and a half with no service....
Jerianne G.,Daly City  CA,1354,374,701,1/27/2014,3.0,"I\'m rather surprised that I haven\'t made an actual review for this place  I\'ve been here a couple of times already.This place is basically like Elephant bar. Its family friendly  and its adult friendly  since there\'s a bar there also. The lighting here has always been dim  so be orepared to squint while reading the menu. The menu varies from pizzas  pastas  and sandwiches  to seafood  light food  and desserts. This place also has several ""customize yourself"" items.When this place first opened up  it really was something big. Over the years  their quality of food sorta went down in a slow descent. They added the ""small snacks"" portion  but some of these snacks do not fit the description of ""small snack"". They\'ve also increased the prices for many of their entrees  but the portions are always smaller than the price you pay for. Some recent additions that have been made are the additional tables outside the restaurant and inside the mall. More seats = more people accommodated = better business.Service here is amazingly slow. I understand that it gets way busy on weekends  but sometimes people who come here after you will end up getting their food before you. Some waiters here work well  while others don\'t. There was an instance where my family and I had waited about 30-40 mins for our food  and when they brought it to our table  they just slid the plates across the table rather than gently pass them to us. They didn\'t even have the nerve to apologize  they just walked off afterwards. I get that people have off days  but you chose to work at a restaurant that gets busy. If you can\'t work well under pressure  then throw in the towel and get another job.Some foods here are definitely not worth the price. Back then  their presentation of foods were on point. But over the years  that has changed. Their pastas sound so good through the description  but when they come out  they look like something anyone can cook within their own homes. I\'m not down to pay $15 just to eat pasta that looks like it was splashed in sauce and dumped on the plate. Recently  I waited for a California chicken sandwich and when it came out  it was just a basic sandwich with fries. Did I really just wait 30 minutes for a simple sandwich that I could\'ve made myself? That and the chicken was burnt also  it tasted like charcoal.Big ups though for the pizookies and other desserts. This is a place I would prefer to seldom go rather than be a regular."
Jayme N.,Embarcadero  San Francisco  CA,3,12,,10/7/2016,1.0,Seated before 5 pm on a Thursday and waited more than 20 mins with zero service even tho everyone around us got served  including 3 tables that came in after us. Approached a manger who basically shrugged it off. This location always has terrible service but this exceeded the usual.
Catherine T.,South San Francisco  CA,0,15,,10/21/2016,1.0,Terrible service. Incompetent staff  mediocre food and way overpriced. You'd be better off driving through a McDonalds then getting anything from here. Had to wait over 2 hours for 3 items to get delivered when I live minutes away. I called and the girl who answered knew nothing  just repeated it would be there shortly. As expected it was cold. Cost me $70 to wait over 2 hours for unsatisfactory food and even worse service.
Julie L.,San Francisco  CA,474,1061,2092,2/13/2015,2.0,Plenty of seats but we still had to wait a little. Hmmm.Appetizer sampler was a good deal since we wanted variety. Didn't enjoy the avocado egg roll which was too mushy. The mozzarella sticks  dip and etc. were ok.For dinner  I had the Atlantic salmon. As always  the fish turns out dry but the amount of sauce/butter ladled onto my rice made it yummy. Enjoyed that more than the actual entree. The veggies were a bit soft. I tried the other dishes and they were also dry. Prices of entrees range from $9.50-$22.00. Worth it? Not so much.
Nicole F.,San Bruno  CA,15,42,42,8/20/2016,1.0,Terrible experience just now. I generally like BJ's  but I'm super irritated right now. My mom  fiance and I came and were told we'd have a 25-30 minute wait. That really ended up being only 15 minutes or so. We got seated outside in the mall seating area  waited about 10 minutes or more and nobody came. Then a waiter who noticed we'd been waiting came and said he'd get someone to check on us. Nobody came for another 10 minutes or more. I finally decided to leave. When a waiter saw us leaving  he apologized and said he could help us right after delivering a plate. Not his fault  but we declined. We were already tired of waiting over 30 minutes so left. Moral of the story  if they don't check on you within a few minutes  leave.
Nancy M.,San Francisco  CA,1,4,,5/16/2016,3.0,Me and my best friend come here a lot to join ourselves. Everytime we come we have a great experience  but i don't know what happen today.We knew it was going to be busy (Warrior Playoff Game) so we called to put our name ahead like we always do. Nobody picked up the phone. So we did what the option told us (put our name on the app) It's was going to be a 45min wait. That's normal for a game night. We got to the host to check in. And we were told that the app doesn't work with the computer system. Why have it as a option if it doesn't work. The host (Blond Hair) told us that it was going to take 10-15 min. We were okay with that. We wait almost 35 min. We keep looking at her. She could have least apologize for waiting longer then usually. Finally we were seat. We already knew what we wanted to drink and eat. The section we were seated look like everyone was just chilling watching the game. We were like cool the serve will get to us faster. NOPE!! We waited 20 more minutes. We had to ask a Busser if he could get our waiter. We saw him go to our server and told him that we were waiting. He comes to his section but completely ignores us. He goes to check on his other tables and doesn't make eye contact or tells us anything. He finally comes to us by that time we were just over it. We order our drinks and all our food right away. We waiting another 15 min to get our drinks. The server only realize that we didn't have our drink when we looked bored. He comes and drops the drinks. Again no apologize for anything.I only going to give 3 stars because the drinks were super super BOOM! And the food was delicious. The manager on duty at the time did come  but me and my friend were just over the whole thing that it wasn't worth our time to explain everything. I'm sorry. Now I have 2 servers that I don't want them to wait on me or my friend. Still coming but if I get him or the other server I would be asking to either switch sections or server.
J L.,Fremont  CA,25,27,4,1/4/2016,1.0,"Second visit to this location.  First was okay  food wise  but service was below part  but first day on the job. This visit  I would question if ANYONE working here has ever been in food service before.  What kind of ""Hostess"" puts a party of 10 in a section where the Wait Staff has been working one day? Adding auto tip for ""large party"" seems like just another was to scam consumers. Doesn\'t it matter that TIP IS FOR SERVICE not an automatic ""gift""? Especially when the order is wrong TWICE!??!  Auto tipping should be illegal but it does guarantee extra income. Disappointing and costly to say the least!"
Gracie M.,San Francisco  CA,28,2,1,5/4/2016,5.0,5 STARS is definitely well deserved for the server we had tonight. :) My little family has been a loyal customer since our son was a baby (and he's 6 now!). It's our favorite BJ's location and we have a lot of memories at this place like multiple birthday dinners  staff lunches  and family Sunday brunches. We often are lucky to always receive good service here  but tonight was GREAT SERVICE. Our server NICK H. was the best! It's our first time having him and let me tell you... he was just so genuinely nice  quick  and my family just enjoyed our time after a long  busy day. I'm a working mom from 7am-6pm so I'm always on the go and family dinners are so important to my family and me.... So when we get service like tonight  I'm not going to miss a chance to blog it (and I RARELY post)! Also  the new manager Tom was so pleasant to talk to. He has really good vibes and he even set my staff's dinner coming up with no hassle. Again  I love this place... My hubby loves it (especially the root beer!)  and if my son loves it.. It's a done deal  we are coming here always. Lol This place deserves more stars. Good food  good bar  great service  and fun location. Ask for Nick H..... AWESOME SERVICE for sure.
Jack R.,San Francisco  CA,1874,1134,1271,2/26/2014,2.0,"I think my friend should have her own reality Tv show. Something that\'s a mix between The Real Housewives of San Francisco and The San Francisco Mafia Wives.She\'s tough  and when she says ""I\'ll cut you "" you best believe she means it.And though I haven\'t seen it  I\'m sure she carries a machete  chainsaw  and some Rocky and Bullwinkle bombs in her purse.So when she says she likes coming here  I\'m not going to disagree with her. At least  not to her face.We used to work together  and are here to catch up.She orders beer  and I order an ahi tuna appetizer  and spicy buffalo wings. I wanted to order the rootbeer float  but when I ask the waiter how much the rootbeer float would be as opposed to a regular rootbeer he says he doesn\'t know. And since he took away our menus awhile ago  and since I don\'t want a rootbeer float that badly  I\'m not going to fight with him. But when she starts asking him about what kind of vodka they have at the bar  and if he can make this or that drink  and he says ""I don\'t know "" I began to shake my head. I hoped he would see it. It was my way of warning him that he better run and get those drinks she wanted  and quick too. You don\'t want to get on her bad side  I tried to convey to him telepathically  as I looked at him  and back at the bar. Hinting that that\'s where he should be. Not here  answering ""I don\'t know"" to what drinks they can and can\'t do.Fortunately  he lived to bring out my appetizers  the tuna had no flavor  and the buffalo wings tasted like Tabasco sauce. Both mediocre. Like the service. But  unlike him  I\'m not going to say a word. I just sat there and agreed when she spoke about how stupid he was  and was thankful that she didn\'t break the cosmopolitan over his head."
Vanessa M.,San Francisco  CA,35,4,1,10/29/2016,1.0,The worst service ever !!!! Came in at 9 and left at 11 just because my food didn't arrive until 10:25. Never
Shin T.,San Bruno  CA,1,162,18,8/29/2016,4.0,Servers are kind. But the beer sampler came out luke warm. My complicated salad order came out right. All other dishes are delicious and perfect!
Bruce H.,LAKE VIEW TER  CA,0,88,217,2/23/2016,2.0,I eat a BJ's quite a bit when I'm on the road.  I dig there late night happy hour  and like the ambiance of sitting in a noisy sports bar when I'm away from home. This location was pretty bad. It took too long to get a waiter  then they never returned to see if I wanted another drink.  I get the Ahi Poke all the time. The one I got here for starters  looked like crap! In addition  the Ahi was cut too large and almost frozen. This place seems disorganized and possibly under staffed. Recently was working in South Sacramento and had been going to the BJ's in Elk Grove....awesome service  fast  good food.
Linda N.,San Francisco  CA,124,506,,1/1/2016,2.0,Lukewarm avocado egg roll appetizer that was probably placed in the microwave before being brought to the table. Lukewarm pizza supposedly straight from the oven. How can the pan be hot yet the cheese on the pizza is barely melted? All the toppings would fall off each time a slice was taken from the pan. The only thing that was at the correct temperature was my wedge salad. -__-I've been here many times and I don't remember the food ever being this bad. Perhaps everyone was hungover from nye celebrations? Service was alright for the most part. Worst $40 spent on a meal to start 2016.
Ryan M.,Port Hueneme  CA,0,3,,10/15/2016,1.0,This place smells terrible  like every beer in the world exploded on their floor and became rotten. We had to leave before we were even brought water. The smell was unbearable.
Alissa K.,Burlingame  CA,0,21,1,10/15/2016,1.0,This is the second consecutive time my fianc and I have had a terrible experience at BJ's in San Bruno. Last year we came here quite often and never had any issues  in fact we used to quite enjoy it. However we both agree the service and food at this location have gone downhill significantly in recent months.To sum up today's lunch experience:- slow  careless  rude service- flat  stale tasting beer- food so terrible we could barely eat any of our appetizer or entreeI noticed we weren't the only guests that were frustrated & unsatisfied. If this place wasn't in such a highly-trafficked location  it would have no chance at surviving. We definitely won't be back.
Jaymie G.,Redwood City  CA,138,143,17,1/31/2016,5.0,"Not sure why this place has such a low rating.... Anyways!Came here on a Saturday afternoon for my friends gender reveal dinner. We had a party of about 40 people which was big enough to make service slow. But that didn\'t happen!! Only thing that was ""slow"" was when we were actually getting our food. But come on! No one can bring out 40 plates at the same time. Lol. Our server was AL. He\'s the main reason I will come back to this establishment! Talk about a man with a sense of humor!! I love it when you go out to eat and your server can laugh and just have a good time. Not once did he give us an attitude about us asking for refills  to order more food  or bring out condiments (because let\'s face it  life would be too easy if we asked for everything at the same time. Lol)But really  AL was amazing! I recommend going here and requesting to sit in his section. I know I\'ll be back for a good laugh! Thanks AL!!!"
Katie N.,San Francisco  CA,103,82,82,7/29/2016,2.0,This place is almost always extremely crowded  especially if it's a big game night because they have TVs. Expect at least a 30 min wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The service here is hit or miss  if you decide to sit in the open seating outside expect to wait a LONG time. What really stinks is that my order has been wrong at least once when brought to the table  but if you're craving a burger and fine with waiting to be seated and have your order taken then sure why not come here.
Ale N.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,10/24/2016,1.0,"Sad to say WE has a HORRIBLE experience here at BJ\'s. My suggestion for every one wanting to stop by and eat here would be to just stop at Red Robbin. Your better of having a great family time and SERVICE!! We had a family dinner last Friday. My sisters food never made it to the table. Our appetizers arrive FROZEN to the table  not once but twice!!! Horrible experience. Lastly  the manager was not helpful at all. But ""our fryers must not be working properly""I made this yelp account just to write this review. Hope you all can see how disappointed we all were with this service and food!!!"
Cindy G.,Hamilton  Canada,119,133,538,4/27/2014,3.0,I've been to this location three times and the only word I can say is: SLOW.The first and second time dine in during lunch and it took forever to get our appetizer and then the entree. I would say a good 20 minute for our food to arrive. But wasn't satisfied with the service and the food was blend. The third time is for happy hour  again it was slow and waited for 5 minutes until this one server greeted and apologized the long wait. But the drinks came in less then 5 minutes and the food  for a good 7-8 minutes. I order the wildberry mojito for $4.00 and it was pretty good. Then the food: first the California club flatbread was good and crispy with various of toppings that is healthy but good. Then chicken potsticker are really delicious along with the avocado roll that has a kick of flavor but at least my friend and I had a pretty good dinner. Then the mini pizooki  I order the cookies and creme pizooki while my friend order the chocolate ghirardelli pizzoki which she said it was moist and sweet. As for the cookies n creme  very creamy and sugary. I would come back but only for happy hour since there is no chance that I'll dine in unless there training the server to be quick.
Bill S.,San Bernardino  CA,1,27,4,10/1/2016,1.0,Of course  I'm thankful because I know there are less fortunate out there that don't have the opportunity to eat out or even eat for that matter. Service at this place horrible  we came in on a Saturday evening  I anticipated it would be busy and it was. The patio had a lot of open seating so we opted to sit out there with the kids. We were seriously looking for other locations to go eat because after we sat outside  it took about 15 minutes for a server to come out. Our server was very nice and professional  the few times we saw her  it appeared she was a little overworked or maybe this place was understaffed. After we ordered our drinks and food  multiple servers came out with a little here and there. When the food finally came  it was cold. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich that I can equate to a gas station grilled sandwich. My wife's personal pizza looked decent  she didn't have any complaints. I like BJ's restaurants but don't be fooled by this one.
Robert G.,San Francisco  CA,13,4,,10/1/2016,1.0,Horrible service one bartender ignored me completely the other looks like Uncle Si from duck dynasty   the standards employers have set is why our work force is what it is SmH calamari was horrible left half the plate
tori c.,Oakland  CA,45,5,5,9/27/2016,1.0,Went for lunch for the first time with my team the service was awful we waited over 45 minutes for a meal they were only 4 people the restaurant was not that busy our food came out cold they overcharged us won't make that mistake again
Gee M.,Vallejo  CA,13,44,25,8/25/2016,1.0,If i could give this place zero stars I would. Our server seemed cool got us our first drinks...the food...cold food....no utensils ketchup or parmessan cheese or red pepper...after we asked for them. We asked for these things again and a refill on our drinks...he goes on break girl covering brings them over i ask for a box...she never comes back so I can ask for the check...check out my reviews i never really say anything negative but no this place has awful service...never coming back. The manager discounted everything but my two beers which is fine but still no not this bjs anytime soon.
Amber U.,Vallejo  CA,66,93,56,5/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I love this place. We came for the GSW game early to get seats around 4:30. Wanted to Pregame a little! Had happy pizzas and beers  mmmmm so tasty! But right as game time comes the TV we are closest to changes to a hockey game... WTH?!!! Asked our waiter to change it  he had to ask the manager. Thankfully she came over and we mentioned how long we've been waiting to see the game. Not to mention 90% of the customers had Warriors gear on.... Had it changed back to Warriors. All is well in the world! Thank you  much appreciated!
Roger P.,South San Francisco  CA,653,363,3591,10/29/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I came back to give it another try. I have to say it's been a big improvement since I last came. The menu has changed  the service is prompt and my food was hot when it came!The menu has taken on more of a fresher look to it. The grilled chicken  the new choices of salads  just a nice refreshing choice of food items. I had a nice grilled chicken pasta. Juicy chicken with broccoli in a yummy Alfredo sauce. I'll be back to try the other items for sure
Greta R.,San Rafael  CA,54,522,57,2/25/2015,5.0,We like the menu at BJ's but the five stars is for our server Al who was awesome. He check in frequently  made good recommendations  etc - all with a brace on how wrist that made carrying beer not especially fun. The BBQ chicken salad was excellent and the stuffed mushrooms we their usual yummy.I think it's the beer that brings is back to this chain on a regular basis. It's not super creative  but it's just good solid beer.  My fav is the piranha pale ale.
Joe P.,South San Francisco  CA,0,3,1,9/22/2016,1.0,Came in for a quick lunch after running around in the mall. My wife and I were seated pretty quickly since it was after lunchtime around 2pm. The server took our order fairly quickly after serving us the water and lemonade we asked for as drinks. My wife ordered the spaghetti and meat balls  and I the 'midnight burger'. As we waited for our food  a few minutes go by and we asked our server to add an appetizer  queso dip to our order. No problem so far.We waited  and waited  and close to 30 minutes had gone by and no food  no queso either. Then another person helping the server brings our food to the table. No queso. We asked about the appetizer  and the original server is asking us what we ordered? We simply said no need for appetizer anylonger since food was here already. The seemed to have misplaced our appetizer order.The burger was still warm  but the spaghetti and meatballs were cold  so my wife asks the server to please reheat it. The server takes the dish away. Meanwhile  I am now eating by myself as my wife sitting across from me watches. I eat slow waiting for the spaghetti to return. Waiting. Waiting. Server comes by and says the dish will be brought out by the manager. Waiting. Waiting.Server finally brings the dish back  no manager. My wife now begins to eat  meanwhile I am done and its my turn to watch her eat. Shame  we were supposed to have lunch together. Server says the manager will be by soon to chat with us. Waited. And waited some more.Enough. Asked the server for check. Paid the check and even tipped her (not as much as I would have otherwise). On way out  the manager was by the door  I told him to read Yelp this afternoon about our experience. The manager claimed he was not ware of this.  As we began to leave  on the way out  three servers by the door overhear my comment about Yelp. One of them very pronouncedly began snipping and making remarks about Yelp  and making fun of both my wife and I.We quickly re-entered the restaurant and faced the person  whom quickly left toward the back. We asked for the manager  and explained the treatment we as customers received by the servers representing BJ's. I asked the manager to have the server come out and apologize to my wife. To their credit  the manager and the server both apologized. Its one thing to have mediocre service  and another to ridicule paying customers. To the manager we wish best of luck. To the disrespectful young server  we wish you well too.  We too were young once.  Hopefully we all learned something today...me  to rethink patronizing this BJ's ever again.
Christine W.,Hamburg  Germany,125,331,263,1/14/2015,2.0,Where do I begin? Don't expect amazing unique food or stellar service either.I called ahead on a Friday night for a party of 5 and when I arrived they said it would take about 30 min. I'm not sure how long it would have took if I didn't call ahead and it looked like there were a lot of people waiting for a table.My family and I just browsed around the bookstore before our table was ready so there were no problems there. We were seated in their confusing 'patio' area which is pretty much part of the mall area. Though it was quieter then being seated inside  we barely saw our server throughout our dinner experience. When we were first seated by the host  it looked like someone spilled their drink or something and so the booth seating was wet so I asked if we could sit at a different booth. The host obliged but  they didn't do anything to fix the wet seat booth that we moved from. They sat a different party there and they said the same thing that the seat was wet and all they offered them was a napkin to place on the wet area. Anyways  for appetizers we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the cheesy fries to start. The appetizers came pretty quickly but we didnt have any utensils or plates. I asked the server and he said ok.....never did it....I asked again  and we finally got utensils  but by this time we finished the apps and had the greasy fingers to prove it.For an entree we shared a large pizza and it was fine. Standard pizza with a pretty good deep dish crust.Overall the experience was meh... I do love their beer offerings but everything else is not what I'm willing to pay for or have the patience for when thinking about where to go for a nice dinner.
Chelsea C.,Yolo  CA,0,17,1,11/26/2016,1.0,I love BJs but this place has one of the worse service ever. The guy hardly checked on us. We were literally done with our main meals and waited for 15-20mins before our server came by to check on us. He forgot he ranch after asking 3x. Ordered an extra side of fries when I asked for just an extra side of ranch and charged us for it. Forgot about my friends order who had a pazookie that came with her meal. Waited 10mins for our dessert. Another 10-15mins to get her dessert. Never refilled our drinks till the very end  asking us and we were done with our meal. He was no existent. We literally stayed there for a 2 hours when it should've been only 1 hour. Horrible. It's the holidays so I won't say our servers name but I hope he gets reprimanded for the crappy service he gave us.
Josh L.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,25,257,55,3/9/2015,2.0,Came for happy hour on Friday with some coworkers. We ordered one salad which was almost delivered to the wrong table (our server had to go back to the kitchen to get it). The presentation of the salad was terrible and it looked very skimpy on ingredients. We also ordered plain nachos  but ended up with a fritos/sour cream concoction (eventually the right order came out). I had the chicken wings  which were meh... they looked so small and weren't as meaty as before. The dipping sauces were watered down and had no consistency.Pizza wasn't bad and the servers were friendly. The kitchen staff needs more attention to detail and presentation.
Chris L.,Portland  OR,96,623,28,12/11/2015,2.0,Ugh  why did we come here after seeing the Yelp reviews. Probably because there wasn't anything else better at the mall. Anyway  the menu is huge and truly impossible to navigate & decide on what to get. Ultimately I opted for just a basic burger  which was just meh. The side salad was actually pretty tasty  but that did not make up for the mediocre foods nor the sub-par burger. A silver lining is the baked cookie with ice cream (I called these skillet cookies)  which was quite tasty. But I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.
Tim B.,Novato  CA,54,277,8,3/4/2015,4.0,"So  after our wonderful excursion to Cambria we drove up Highway 1 to Carmel  then battled obnoxious traffic coming into Santa Cruz. At first I\'d contemplating continuing following the coast to check out the newly constructed Devil\'s Slide tunnel just south of Pacifica. But the Big Sur experience had tested our patience - it being Presidents\' Day  there was more than the normal share of touristy drivers - you know the type  not staying at any consistent speed. Or direction.Because of that we elected to travel Highway 17 to Los Gatos  then 85 to Mountain View where it intersects with Interstate 280  and then travelled up the Peninsula until we reached South San Francisco and got off at ""Interstate"" 380  all 2 1/2 miles of it. That proved too long as we exited that freeway at El Camino Real and thrust our car towards the legendary Tanforan Park.Back in the day Tanforan served as the quintessential aging 1950\'s/1960\'s mall  and by the early aughts it was playing that role in an unfortunate way  as tenants were deserting the shopping centers like Bill Cosby supporters. The powers that be decided that a renovation was in order  and by the time I returned in 2006 after a five year absence  I barely recognized the place.One can argue about the goods and evils of renovating the center  but I do think the addition of BJ\'s was a boon - before all the shopping center offered was food courts and a few forgettable cafes. Our 2006 trip to this location was the first BJ experience we had (insert juvenile joke here)  although in the meantime we have also perused the Sacramento and San Rafael locations.This time  we arrived at about 2:30 - I was thinking it\'d be rather quiet  but it was about 90% full. In spite of that  our service was prompt and professional. We each ordered from the light menu  and were satisfied for most of the rest of the day. Buffalo Bison Burger  baby!I guess my only criticism of this location is that I wouldn\'t be able to distinguish it from the other franchises - maybe there was something to highlight the fact that it was in South San Francisco as opposed to Sacramento  but I missed it. And  you\'d think that something with the word ""Brewhouse"" in its name would  you know  brew its own beer. Perhaps I\'m nave  however it is good that the place is reliable and consistent."
Sandy N.,Presidio  San Francisco  CA,0,81,1,11/20/2016,3.0,If I saw my restaurant with less than 3 stars I would take action. Service has always hit and miss for speed and attentiveness. This day we sat for 10 minutes before our server arrived. Don't sit in the back of the restaurant it smells like a urinal  tho the bathrooms are quite a distance away. But please rework your system I can imagine your staff doesn't stay long.
Sam V.,South San Francisco  CA,0,11,1,2/27/2017,3.0,The food is pretty good here but the service ALWAYS sucks! It's super packed and seems like they cant hire good servers or the kitchen is backed up. Either way  if your looking for good service and quality food  I would go across the street to Jacks. If you want some decent happy hour deals but don't care about frustrating service  then go to bjs.
Gabe M.,Bloomington  MN,0,5,,3/15/2016,5.0,"Me and my family ate at this restaurant yesterday before leaving to fly home from the San Francisco bay area. What first drew us to BJ\'s was the attractive building. We were not even planning on going to BJ\'s (we were on our way to Red Robin) and I saw the attractive brick building with great landscaping and a cool  shiny beer vat outside. I said  ""Ooohh! Look! That place looks good!"" So we made a split second change and tried BJ\'s.And it was a great choice!Food was hot  tasty  and came out in a timely manner. Our server  Matt was AWESOME!! I haven\'t had many servers as genuine and as caring as Matt was. His hospitality sure as heck was not forced  but very  very genuine and real. He was at our table every few minutes checking in on us  asking if we needed refills  or if he could get anything else for us. He even had around 4-5 other tables while having us  a table of 6. But he treated us like we were his only table! He even gave us a free giant cookie to share before leaving California. He set an EXCELLENT first impression of BJ\'s for us! Thank you  Matt!"
Amy K.,Santa Clara  CA,41,8,11,1/27/2016,1.0,Slow slow slow too SLOW!! I came here with three other girls for lunch... We even ordered ahead for 11 o'clock... We got one salad by 11:40 am and the others came 10 min later......Our waitress  of course  brought the pizookies at the same time as our food... with three spoons. We asked for an additional spoon  and she disappeared for 45 minutes........ Don't even get me started on the time we had to wait for one to go box and our check..... At the end  the only thing we wanted was getting out of here.
Karleen T.,San Francisco  CA,14,4,1,4/21/2016,5.0,Always a pleasure to come here! The staff is always kind. Never have to wait for more then 5 minutes and super fast service!!
Jane S.,San Bruno  CA,0,18,,8/6/2016,5.0,I really like Bjs. I live right across the street so I like to come here often to have drinks with friends. But it can get a little pricey sometimes... I love their jeremiah red beer & most of their appetizers! My last visit here  my waiter was so great & attentive; his name was Billy & I also had a great conversation with one of the managers  her name was Rochelle; she was so cute & fun!!! I always a great experience at Bjs! So I don't understand the low rating! Cmon people! ;)
Roselle B.,South San Francisco  CA,0,2,,3/8/2017,4.0,After not receiving our ice cream for our piezookie with a take out order  the Manager actually called us to advise the ice cream was missed. To make good on the situation  the Manager offered us 2 free pizookies. When I went to pick up the gift  we actually were given a gift card and a free pizookie. Very nice gesture from the Manager cuz we weren't even going to say anything. Then 2 days later  after his time off  the Manager followed up to ensure we received our compensation. Very pleased with the service and follow up treatment. Always happy with our food from BJ's restaurant. Thank you for the good service.
Discourser T.,Daly City  CA,1,32,,10/25/2015,1.0,"My wife and I stopped to grab an early dinner on October 25. After a brief wait  we were seated in the back room. Our server appeared and said he would be with us in a few minutes. No big deal since we were both looking at the menu. He came back about five minutes later saying he was going to check on our drinks. I looked up at an obviously ""high"" employee and informed him we hadn\'t ordered anything. He mumbled something and left  returning a few minutes later with napkins for drinks. We ordered two waters and an iced tea. Since we were ready to order our meal we went ahead. We ordered tomato bisque in a bread bowl  an arugula beet salad  a flat bread pizza  and Mediterranean chicken tacos. Five minutes later an expediter arrived with a bowl of tomato bisque and a visibly dirty spoon. A second expediter arrived in the heels of the first with our salad. I was slightly irritated that our order was wrong. Mind you  I had heard the three surrounding tables complain that their orders were wrong as well. The manager had already come over to smooth over issues at one table. My wife could not get our server\'s attention and went to the bar to get an employee. The employee tracked down the manager who never was able to find our table. In the meantime  our ""high"" server made it to our table where I explained what we had ordered  requested it be filled correctly  and to bring clean silverware. By that time we were both frustrated with the lack of ability to take and fulfill an order  being waited on by a clearly intoxicated employee  and the failure of the manager to come to our table after being requested not once but twice by the same employee. We left our table and informed the host stand of why we were leaving. Not so much as effort to get the manager. It would appear this is a regular occurrence. This BJ\'s has been a toilet for some time and I will never step foot in this one again. I will also alert anyone who is interested in the pathetic service and poor cleanliness of this location."
Kai S.,Daly City  CA,90,97,18,12/29/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I've given this place a lot more chances lately & I honestly feel like the way that this place is set up now a days is so much better than it was in the past. I've received great service one evening from Camila R. and another from the server Tyler in the last couple of months. Their service alone made me completely want to change my review on yelp from one star to a whopping 4 star review. Whenever I was seated  it did not take more than 10 minutes to wait  the food came out as fast as possible  and I felt very attended to while I was dining once with my best friend  and once with my entire family. Both experiences were great! I've stuck with the same dish for the longest time: Parmesan Crusted Chicken with Garlic Mashed Potatoes & Broccoli & i always get the pizzookie trio at the end of my meals  especially to share. I've not once in the last few times I've come here felt like my food was subpar or there was anything wrong with it. My only complaint would be a question  WHY TAKE OUT THE BAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE SIDE :'( I loved getting that to pair with my meals  but I'll definitely live without it haha. I just was sad to see that it wasn't on the menu anymore. Besides that small factor  I'm very pleased with how my service was at this location and look forward to the next time I go to BJ's in San Bruno!
Nicholas M.,Orlando  FL,583,27,43,3/4/2016,2.0,The reviews are true. Service is painfully bad with the food being somewhat decent. We had to beg the waitress to take our app. plates off the table  food came really slow  water came even slower. If I do come back  it will only be for the dessert.
Ashley L.,San Jose  CA,0,15,9,8/30/2016,1.0,"Rocky was super unpleasant as a server. Not only did he get the order wrong  he charged twice for an item that took 20 mins longer than the rest of the food to come. Once we made him aware of the double charge  he then SNATCHED the receipt from my mom\'s hand. Rude! He also thought it was important for us to know he ""is being sent home early"" and someone else is taking over. That is no way to transition your customers from one server to another. Quite frankly  I understand why he was being sent home and why the other server was taking over. It\'s too bad it wasn\'t before he started serving us."
Nicole B.,San Francisco  CA,0,2,1,1/30/2016,5.0,Miguel was are waiter and he had really good customer service and made our time at here great.The food was good too.
Mom Of T.,Visalia  CA,0,9,,8/13/2016,1.0,"Veryyyyyy poor service tonight. Wait was so long and there were lots of empty tables. Got out food and my med rare steak was almost well done and the tacos with no cilantro were covered in it. We politely brought it to the servers attention and all he said ""ok"" and walked off."
Janice R.,Pacifica  CA,0,4,,5/31/2017,1.0,Bj's really needs to hire more competent people ! With better personalities .. the young short Filipino hostess has absolutely no emotion when greeted  and as far as the young clean cut short Hispanic waiter   VERY unprofessional to show favoritism to customers walking in and not paying any attention to others sitting or greeting others in the same manner . But then again it is only BJ's.. You get 1star only because you have to in order to continue. I made a reservation specifically for 10 people with 2 high chairs for my daughters graduation we were told that it would possibly be 2side by side booths or tables which we were ok with  and when we got there they took us to the back and we had what looked like a table for 4 with a smaller table next to it  not even the same size . It looked tacky and all the hostess stated was   that's all the tables we had left ! WTF?? Completely unacceptable!! Luckily we had 2 tables in the bar area while we were waiting for this reserved table .. This completely ruined my daughters celebration and hope for all of us to sit together as a family . The older gentleman we had as our server looked a lil over whelmed  but was very nice ( thank you )and again   thank you BJ's for for ruining what was supposed to be a preplanned good afternoon .
Frank C.,Southeast  Las Vegas  NV,96,14,9,7/28/2016,1.0,"One of the worst BJS restaurant Ever .. I was waiting with my brother in law and my nephew who\'s 2 years old only .. They let us wait for over 45 minutes because they didn\'t have a table for him ( ""a chair for him"") So stupid .. When he is just 2 Years old .. How sad this place is ! Just the waiter "" Taylor M "" saved the customer service in this place !"
Natali R.,Daly City  CA,9,52,9,10/28/2015,4.0,My boyfriend  dog  and I go here very often as it is close to his home and it has outdoor seating with a fire pit and heater lamps.Food is always good. I love that they have a late happy hour. I enjoy their avocado egg rolls and craft beers (Jeremiah Red is a good one). Staff is mostly friendly but not always. Depends on who you get. Our food and beverages arrive in a timely manner. On one occasion  my boyfriend and I went alone and sat inside. We ordered a pizza and a couple beers. The chef comes out a few moments later to explain that his staff burned our pizza just a little bit on one of the edges. He said that he is making a brand new one himself and that he did not want to send something unacceptable out. Wow! We were impressed. He said they would offer us a discount for the delay. Great  thanks! We probably would have taken the slightly burned pizza  but it was nice to know he cared!I would hate to ever run into a problem here  because I love it!
Audrey K.,Los Angeles  CA,167,267,267,1/2/2015,4.0,this is my go-to place for american food! You can never go wrong with a menu full of selections. What I love is that they are consistently updating their menu here and there. I've tried many things  from appetizers  to salads  to pizza  pasta  and the delicious and oh so deadly desserts. My go to appetizers would have to be spinach artichoke dip with chips  avocado spring rolls  calamari  and the bruschetta.My go to salad  is the crispy honey chicken  it's so deliciously good! (If I want to be on the healthier side haha)And go to entrees would be the chicken alfredo(sometimes it's done nicely  and sometimes it can be bland). Pizzaaaaaas are always deep dish! Because it's delish! Went with the bj's favorite  which consists of onions  olives  bell peppers  mushrooms  tomato  pepperoni  and sausages. It's so good and I normally dislike pizza  but when it's gourmet and deep dish.. I can't say no. Can't forget about the dessert! ALWAYS  pizzokie. When I can't decide  I go for the trio(consists of 3 of your choice). But  established that the white chocolate macadamia is always going to be the number 1.
Jeff S.,San Francisco  CA,0,44,,11/4/2015,2.0,This place has really gone downhill. Seems like management has lost control of their staff or they haven't trained them properly. The wait times for food are ridiculous lately and the last time i was there they completely screwed up our orders.I always get great service at the bar though.
Melissa S.,Reno  NV,33,148,43,1/14/2015,4.0,I go here when it's late and I'm hungry  because it's open until midnight.The service is sometimes slow. Nothing to really complain about.I really like that they have plenty of different things to choose from. Pizza  sandwhiches  burgers  soups  salads...... And a lot of alcohol. If you don't like to watch drunken people eat  do not come here.However  if you enjoy decent food or need to get something to eat after a mall trip  then this is a good place for you.I'm a sucker for salmon. I recommend their Atlantic salmon and their avocado egg rolls.
Melissa C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,1,8/5/2016,1.0,First off  BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants and I absolutely love the food (especially the pizookies). However  today was not a good day for them.I placed a to go lunch order online at 11:30am and indicated a 12:15pm pick up. I got the BBQ pork sandwich with a side salad. I figured 45 minutes would be enough for one sandwich. WRONG! I got there at 12:10 and was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes  because there were several large orders ahead of mine. I did not leave BJ's with food in hand until 12:55. It took them AN HOUR AND A HALF to cook my one sandwich and a small salad. There were two groups of people ahead of me and each bad 10-15 entrees PER group. So I had to wait while 20-30 entrees were prepped ahead of my ONE sandwich. While I absolutely understand the importance of making orders as they come in  this was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. One sandwich should not have taken an hour and a half to get to a guest. I waited to arrive to pick up my food for 45 minutes  and then I waited another 45 minutes in the restaurant. Not cool. The only plus is that the employee at the take out counter was friendly and kept apologizing and volunteering to go check on my food for me. I will not do a to go order again here.
Ahmad K.,Daly City  CA,14,6,7,2/5/2016,1.0,"This location is the worst place I have ever been in.. BJ\'s is known to be great.. Food always tastes good.. However the front disk at this location is awful  unwelcoming & total waste of time.. They always lie to you about the time u need to wait.. & even after you wait longer you get someone rude to tell u ""Well we paged ur waiting device but you wasn\'t here"".. This is not one time thing.. This is like something I know I will have to deal with every time I go with my children..I done with this location today.. I will make sure everyone I know will hear my story.."
Joyce B.,Daly City  CA,0,6,,8/16/2016,1.0,"Service was extra slow today  not sure why since it was after the lunch rush. Asked for a free pizookie since I have rewards from the app  took about 30 minutes or longer to get it sent to the table. I also had to ask for a booster seat 3 times before one was brought to my table. Server was rude as hell. My aunt had asked for some sugar and the server\'s response was  ""I asked you earlier if you wanted some and you said no."" WHAT THE HELL? You don\'t ever respond to a customer like that. Suck it up and bring the damn sugar. It\'s not my fault you signed up for this job! I won\'t be coming back here."
Francisco G.,San Francisco  CA,46,53,1,11/3/2015,1.0,Hella expensive  rude service  just straight shit.Unless you want a cold burger and cold fries for $50 bucks I recommend McDonalds.It's like they just stopped trying and knew you would pay just on location alone. I mean they don't even wipe the tables off anymore.
Brannon T.,San Jose  CA,227,11,,8/22/2015,1.0,So you may be wondering of why exactly I am giving BJs a 1 star review. Well basically  my girlfriend and I used to come here on a pretty regular basses even though every time we come  the service is literally the worst! Management I really hope you are reading this because I am sitting here right now  20 minutes after being sat  our waiter still has not greeted us. This happens every time we come here. I go to a lot of BJs in the South Bay and never have this problem. The wait staff is rude  don't know the menu  ignore you when you are trying to get their attention  and this is the best one. Countless times when we want to order and our waiter is no where to be found and we ask the hostess to get our waiter or waitress  we ALWAYS get an eye roll.We stopped coming here because of the completely awful service even through the food is good. I hope you read this review to your staff at line up as I too were in the industry for awhile in order to put them in check or something. If you want to talk more feel free to message me  but this has seriously got to stop!
Carina M.,San Francisco  CA,481,319,27,9/10/2014,3.0,I like BJ's for a drink - especially a beer and to catch some sports television However  with drinking  especially beer  one gets hungry! I just don't really like the food choices here - for the price  I feel like I'm eating way overpriced frozen food :/ What I do like is 1. parking is free (yay)2. lots of parking3. lots of space4. tv's with games of all types on5. beer selection
Akayla C.,San Francisco  CA,476,10,25,6/30/2016,3.0,BJ's is my go to favourite place- however  I'm really upset that they changed the happy hour regulations. I use to be able to order from the Happy Hour menu in the dining area but now it's only if you're seating at the bar area.
Jia A.,South San Francisco  CA,9,32,5,10/12/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I haven't been here for a couple years  and BJ's never fails to disappoint me... Why did I go back? BECAUSE AGAIN JACK'S WAS CROWDED. Why do I keep making the same mistake?! Here are my issues:- I ordered one of the lunch specials. It came with a salad of your choice plus a personal one topping pizza. When I started to eat the Caesar salad  the lettuce was wilted  rotten  soggy  and not crisp. Yum. Wtf?! So I sent it back. When I received it the second time  there was no difference. And by that time  I was over it. My pizza was honestly whatever. - My mom ordered the chicken wings. They were SALTY AF and way overcooked and dry.- My boyfriend ordered the BBQ plate  which isn't even worth reviewing. The fries were the best part.-The service still sucks. So over this place.
Stephanie B.,South San Francisco  CA,73,140,37,8/31/2014,4.0,-Been going here for years-Good food  ok prices-Classic American-Large Menu -Lunch deals and happy hr ate good value-Good service  kind management  - Must try; Pizza  Parm Crusted Chicken and Chicken Alfredo Pasta and Mini Cheeseburger Sliders.
Riana C.,San Francisco  CA,243,196,14,11/9/2015,4.0,The food is standard BJs.This location seems to be consistently busy so make reservations!Had something happen with one of the orders in our large group  but management handled the situation very very well. Great to see customer service as a priority and management that takes the time to reach out to clients.
Tyler H.,San Francisco  CA,192,130,6,12/4/2015,2.0,It had been a bucket list item of mine to actually visit a BJ's  and I'm beyond disappointed.Our server meant well  but was just inexperienced and poorly trained. Took a long time to take our order  bring us drinks  etc. It was the middle of the day  not too busy and I was in a party of six.They completely forgot the order of a college. By the time his food came out we had all finished. Even after we paid  all of our dirty dishes were still our table and it was just a mess. We walked away and saw the dirty dishes piled up from the people next to us who were leaving as we sat down. Such a poor experience. I'd rather go to Subway.
Joseph D.,Pittsburg  CA,0,8,,8/8/2016,4.0,I will make this short and sweet: If you have come to this restaurant and have not had an enjoyable eating experience GIVE THIS RESTAURANT ANOTHER CHANCE. They have a new guy in charge at this restaurant (Eugene) he seems to have his act together and has a real concern about the people that come to Bj's. We had a great experience here and I recommend this restaurant.
Thomas W.,Pleasanton  CA,0,3,,1/20/2016,5.0,For my first experience at a BJ's restaurant  I could not have asked for a better experience.I went in with an open mind  unlike most first time customers in restaurants these days; however from the moment I sat down until the moment it was time to leave... my expectations could have never been more inaccurate. For me  it's all about the service. I'm a people person  who hates people. Weird right? But like anyone out there  I create a great relationship with someone who shows interest in me and my friends and provides an environment that I feel as comfortable as eating at home in my own living room. My server Chaz  was more than I could ever ask for. I felt as if he was my best friend from the moment we sat down  receiving an oddly-familiarwelcome from a very unfamiliar friend... and I use the term friend loosely because regardless that I had never met him before he left such an impression that I felt inclined to invite him out for a glass of wine with my group after he got off work. He was unusually personable  in a great way  and it was one of the most pleasant experiences I've had at a casual dining restaurant in this area.Bottom Line/TLDR: Go to BJ's in San Bruno and ask for Chaz  and whether you are expecting a fun dining experience or not  you'll definitely get one.
Richard C.,Carmel  CA,26,8,10,1/2/2017,1.0,Slow service and the staff seemed to be just hanging out. We had a 40 minute wait while there were empty  but dirty tables. There were also other empty tables  but not sure why they weren't seating people there. The Salinas location is much better will not be back to this one.
Uel L.,Fairfield  CA,40,99,192,8/15/2015,4.0,I always come here for one reason. To eat their calamari and the ahi poke. They also have that pork chops and rib eye steak that my family loves to eat. Their clam chowder and tortia soup are their best in my opinion. I don't get tired ordering my favorite food if I'm in the vicinity.
Denise I.,San Francisco  CA,26,38,19,5/29/2016,2.0,Ended up here yesterday b/c my out-of-town  ex-inlaws chose it. Service was slow and inattentive. Took at least 45 minutes to receive our food  they forgot the fries  never refilled the empty water glasses. Food was solidly mediocre  but wasn't expecting much to begin with  so on that front it didn't disappoint.
Tim O.,Evanston  IL,11,28,1,12/31/2016,2.0,Every single time I eat here something goes wrong. Whether it is he glasses that don't feel completely clean or a waiter that forgets about m3z. I go here for work  but other than that this is not a great option.
Johnny B.,Reno  NV,57,352,73,10/13/2015,2.0,I've never been so disappointed in service at a BJ's brewery as I have when visiting this location. It took over an hour to get our food from when we placed our order. We watched other people that arrived and ordered after us receive their food which was really frustrating. Had we lived in this town we would have just left and not waited. Unfortunately  we were from out of town and weren't familiar with the area which is what brought us here in the first place. I will give credit where credit is due  the manager did come out and at least acknowledge that it was an unreasonable amount of time that we waited for our food. He offered us a Pizookie on the house  I countered with what I thought was a fair resolution and he obliged. The food was still decent  once it finally arrived. Saved them from a 1 star review. I won't ever return to this BJ's.
Kanoa U.,South San Francisco  CA,99,85,362,9/18/2015,2.0,"I\'ve been there a few times a typically they are fine. But I ordered their kale and Brussel sprouts salad and it just had the Brussel sprouts in it (with other things) but when I told the waiter that they didn\'t have any kale in this just lettuce and arugula  the waiter assured me that the arugula was their kale. In what world is arugula kale? I was so shocked by his genuine response that I couldn\'t even argue with him. Somehow he genuinely convinced my friend that I ate with. When he left I pulled out my phone to show my friend what kale actually looks like and what arugula looks like. Anyways maybe I\'m making a bigger deal out of this than I should... But if I order a specific salad  I\'m hoping to get what\'s on it. That wasn\'t really what made this a 2. The pizza was really bland. It was their ""most popular"" combo one we ordered. I love pizza  and I actually try not to judge a place too hard on it  although I\'ve had decent pizza from BJ\'s before. That was the most disappointing part. Not sure what\'s going on over there but I hope they can turn it around. If you\'re going to grab a beer and watch the game  then it\'s probably fine  otherwise maybe just stick to their pizookies (pazookie... Or however you spell it). #Disappointed"
Maria C.,San Francisco  CA,96,14,6,10/17/2015,4.0,I see this place has got some not-so-hot reviews. I've always had a good experience here; but I feel like you gotta know some things. 1st this place is ALWAYS busy! So if you come during regular hours or with a big party  expect to wait. I generally come here with my BF and we always come after 9pm. We've never had to wait for a table. 2nd we almost always order the same thing: avocado egg rolls  the BJ's Classic pizza and the Southern Fried chicken; we've never been disappointed!If you know when to come and what to order  this place is pretty good!!
Doris M.,San Bruno  CA,0,31,,12/4/2016,4.0,Was kind of leery coming here after reading the recent reviews about the poor service. We only had to wait a few minutes before getting seated. Matt took our order for food and beverages and both came in a timely manner. He finished his shift during our meal and introduced us to Asia  his replacement. We received thoughtful service from her. I had finished my food but asked for more water. Asia brought 2 waters in to go cups so that we could take it with us. My husband needed a box for his left over French Dip sandwich. She provided a container for that as well as one for the au jus without us asking  which is rare in any restaurant.
Maria O.,San Bruno  CA,1,10,1,7/13/2016,2.0,"Had lunch on a Wednesday with 5 friends. First problem was our drink order. Asked for a margarita top shelf. All I could taste was the sour margarita mix. When we let the server know he said "" we can remake it or you can order a shot of tequila. We got the extra shot with a x bill for 9 dollar. So the margarita was 19 dollars. Sean asked for Long Island ice tea. It was also weak. Then to top it off one order was skipped. We waited and waited. I\'ll skip BJ\'s in the future"
LON B.,Oakland  CA,1,14,,9/16/2015,1.0,Very poor service  i ordered my meal  it took 30 min to come  and when it did the waitress threw it at me. I had done nothing  when i complained to the Mrg about it he said there was nothing he could do.This is the only Bj this has happened to me.
Ro A.,San Francisco  CA,26,9,7,6/24/2016,1.0,WORST service ever!!!!! HORRIBLE!! Took them 45 minutes to bring a wedge salad. I ordered a rib eye steak and an hour & 15 minutes later and still no steak. We finally had it and complained to the GM. He was very apologetic and offered to pay for our meal. That's the only good thing that happened. If I could give them zero stars  I would.
Eric C.,Outer Sunset  San Francisco  CA,122,24,16,5/31/2016,5.0,Heriberto M  the waiter was extremely friendly. He even offered and helped my friend wipe down his jacket because my clumsy friend spilled water all over himself. Jimmy and Dahlia our server was extremely nice and our food was served in a timely matter. I highly recommend coming to this restaurant and definitely give them a little more tips!
Carlamae R.,Burlingame  CA,27,42,9,9/4/2015,1.0,Ugh I do not know why we come here. Maybe cause of the pizookies. But service sucks. Got here at 8pm  it is now 10:30... We are just sitting here waiting for our bill to be given to us. Not like we are a party of 12.. Its only us 2. Food is meh.Service is horrible. Pizookies i love.
Sarah L.,San Francisco  CA,31,4,,3/31/2016,1.0,Waited for over an hour just to walk away from our table. Normally we would have waited but seriously the front of house staff need to learn not to roll their eyes at guests or give so much attitude. We came here to have a nice family dinner  not to get turned around by such poor customer service. All I wanted to do was feed my kid. Jasmine  I hope you learn how to be courteous to your patrons next time.
Steve J.,San Francisco  CA,12,22,20,2/7/2015,4.0,This place brings back the delicious memories from childhood of devouring a deep dish personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut - I mean that in the best possible way. Bear in mind  I wouldn't touch Pizza Hut today unless I was absolutely desperate. But 20+ years ago  Pizza Hut deep dish was the best!I've been here three times now  and each time I've tried a different Deep Dish. The Veggie continues to remain my favorite - the the buffalo chicken is a close second. To top it off  this place has a nice in house craft beer selection. My wife and I split two full flights (4 lights and 4 darks). I've consistently landed on the Oasis Amber as my favorite. Service is on par. The Pizza will take a bit before it comes out to the table (maybe 30-45 min) - but that's always a good sign IMO.
Vivian T.,Outer Sunset  San Francisco  CA,0,1,,6/20/2016,5.0,I came here on a busy Saturday afternoon with my friends and we were seated in the indoor patio area in the mall. Why there was an outdoor patio inside a mall  I'll never know  but it was so worth it because we had the best service through our waiter Matt. He was approachable  kind and attentive with us. I had no idea what to order because I wasn't very hungry  but Matt recommended the Chicken Tacos and it was perfect. I have also been watching my weight for the last few weeks and it was both a tasty and lean meal. He also recommend that my friends and I share a pizzookie for dessert. Probably the best thing I've ever eaten in my entire life! Overall fabulous experience.
T M.,Richmond  CA,0,25,1,6/19/2016,5.0,I have been to a number of BJ's and haven't had as good a service as I received last week from a young man named Tyler. Tyler immediately helped my friend and I as we entered happy hour on a busy weds evening. We had  had reservation for 8ppl in the larger part of the restaurant but a few people cancelled and the service was SOOO good we remained in the bar. As our friends trickled in Tyler promptly took their order  he checked on us regularly and even let us know when he went on break. We will surely be back the food an drinks were equally as good!!!! Best BJ's by far!!!!
Jackson L.,San Francisco  CA,3,5,3,7/24/2015,1.0,"Vegetarian gets rash from Portobello Burger. Poor service overallAs a vegetarian  I was very limited by my options. When I ordered the vegetarian-friendly Portobello Mushroom Burger  I bit into it and found a piece of beef patty in it.Immediately  I asked my waitress to check on my burger. I asked her  ""Is this beef? She confirmed it  and I told her that menu said the burger was vegetarian-friendly and only include mushrooms.She responded  ""No  it\'s not "" and walked away without honoring my complaint. I will not return to this restaurant. If a vegetarian cannot order the only thing the menu that\'s vegetarian  then something is not right with the restaurant. The $12 Portobello Burger gave me a rash."
Robert T.,Alameda  CA,0,51,2,6/28/2016,4.0,Good food and great beer. This may be the only chain restaurant that I really love. The beer is excellent  I wish they'd sell it outside the restaurant  particularly the red  brown and Pirahna pale ales.
Amanda N.,San Francisco  CA,0,6,,1/12/2017,1.0,This location seriously is need of a serious clean up. Upon entering the restaurant there is a terrible smell  like mildew or something. That smell just ruins the appetite. They should shampoo the rugs  wipe the tables thoroughly and mop the floor by the bar area and of course clean the bathroom from top to bottom.
Alvin J.,San Francisco  CA,236,79,206,6/16/2014,2.0,"Our family came here on Father\'s Day (since our father craved pizza). There was about a 30-min wait when we arrived around 1pm  but that was expected.  The hostess (w/glasses) was nice  warm  smiley  and accurate with our estimated wait time and once our hand indicator lit/buzzed - we were off to be seated. That day had a give-away. All the men at the table were given a beverage glass commemorating Father\'s Day. I thought that was very nice!We did have a few mishaps during our lunch. The first one was that the booth wasn\'t entirely wiped down and clean. That was a bit awkward. One side still had come crumbs and grease on the bench. So we had to wait for them to get a rag to clean that off for us. Once seated  we decided to order three pizzas:Gluten-free thin crust pizza; w/artichoke hearts  roasted garlic  and cilantroHand-tossed pizza - BJ\'s Classic Combo (Pepperoni  Italian Sausage  Mushrooms)Deep Dish pizza: Chicken Bacon Ranch (Grilled garlic chicken  Applewood smoked bacon  jack and cheddar cheese  red onions  diced tomatoes and a drizzle of ranch dressing.While waiting  we were brought our drinks and soon after our plates.The second mishap was that the plates they brought were still dirty. It may have run through their dishwasher  but there were dried up cheese residue on a couple plates and specks of ""I don\'t know what"" on another. The waiter promptly replaced them after I addressed it. This time  the plates were perfectly clean and spotless. We had a well-mannered and polite waiter.It wasn\'t too long a wait for all the pizzas. Looked good  but I didn\'t hear any ""mmmms"" during the meal. I was average at best....but not terrible. The deep dish tasted more like a pan-style pizza and had some crispy edges similar to Pizza Hut. That had good flavor. The hand-tossed was a bit disappointing though. It was as plain as it gets and the crust was flat in both texture and taste. It reminded me of carnival pizza. I didn\'t try the gluten-free pizza (which was for my mother). She said that it tasted fine  but they forgot the cilantro topping. That was the third and last mishap. I did notify the waiter who offered to sprinkle it on  but I just asked him to take it off the bill which he did.The place itself had high ceilings  nice crowd  and lots of TV screens for World Cup coverage and the Giants game. Also - nice that there\'s a B&N next door.I really really really wanted to give a basic 3-stars  but there were just too many mishaps and I feel I need to rate based on my overall BJ experience yesterday. However  minus the mishaps - I\'d give it 3 stars."
Diane C.,San Mateo  CA,55,1,,6/24/2016,1.0,Ordered a pizookie to go today. That was it. Not only did it take 40 minutes to get it  when i opened it up the cookie was burnt to a crisp  hard as a rock. The ladies at the take out counter were rude and seemed uninterested in helping a paying customer. Ok  maybe i didnt order the entire menu but I do frequent this restaurant...was hoping to get treated better...
J G.,Burlingame  CA,59,26,10,5/15/2016,1.0,Terrible experience tonight  and we've been to BJ'S many time. For starters we had 7 in our party  appetizers came pretty quick and we're good. Drinks also came  we'll 6 did the 7th took about 15 minutes. Meals came 5 and of 7 INCORRECT  Asked for no mayo  my burger came fully loaded with mayo. My mother asked for extra mayo and wedge fries  hers came with no mayo and skinny fries. Both of those are manageable  so we ate with no complaints. My 2 young daughters had kids meals  one with chicken strips and apple sauce  of course they bring it with fries and no applesauce so my toddler had a meltdown. They finally bring her applesauce but NO SPOON  we asked 3 different people for spoons  another 15 minutes with NO spoon. Another meltdown.My other daughter ordered the kids cheeseburgers  they come and NO LIE  the burgers were about the size of a half dollar (one bite) and the bun was trippen the sz  we all laughed about it but the server or manager did nothing about it. Last but not least was my teenager ordered a turkey club with no sauce  garlic  mayo or ranch. She hates sauces/condiments of course it comes with all the white gooey garlic/mayo sauce dripping from it  she wanted to puke. We told the server which of course they had to make another one. By the time it came  15 minutes later  everyone was done and wanted to get the hell outta there she took a few bites but was no longer hungry. You would think they would compensate something but nope nothing  our server didnt even care about all the screwups..we spent over $125 for Shitty service  and mediocre food. Not to mention 2 got diarrhea and I have vomited twice since coming home. It's going to be awhile before we go back to any BJ's.
Chris S.,San Francisco  CA,6,96,33,5/15/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I've consistently had really bad beer that lacked carbonation and any depth of flavor. I'm not just talking about their own brew but also any other beer on tap like new castle or boddington. Also this isn't the first time that I felt this way since the last time I came it was the same experience. It even happened to me when I came here for a work lunch and ordered a soda. Even that was flat and desperately needed carbonation. Lastly the service is always horrible at the bar where the bar tender don't acknowledge you. I'll never return!
Liz E.,Elk Grove  CA,91,43,1,5/13/2016,2.0,"2 stars for the useless call-ahead service. I called at 6:38 and was told it was a 35-40 minute wait for a party of 2. Get to the restaurant at 7:08 and then I\'m told it\'s another half hour wait but I\'ll ""be at the top of the list"". Fast forward to 7:55 when I have to get up and ask them how much longer because they\'ve called 6 parties of 2  a party of 7  and a party of 3. Girl checks the computer and realizes we called ahead and they finally seat us. Ridiculous if you ask me."
MJ C.,San Mateo  CA,0,44,1,7/6/2016,3.0,I am giving this a three star simply because of my server  Joe. He was friendly and professional. He made up for the could-not-care-less receptionist with the eye glasses. Quality of my ribs was also good. Too bad no free bread. My side of steamed broccoli was a total of two pieces - really?!I have been to the same restaurant in Bridgepoint  San Mateo.... i will never go there again. Noisy and service bad and always makes a mistake with the order.
JD G.,Austin  TX,239,164,52,7/24/2015,3.0,This place is ALWAYS packed and the experience is never that great. It starts out in the crappy mall parking lot that needed to be re-surfaced 10 years ago  with no parking. Once you're actually able to make it inside  you have to wait forever to get sat. This would be understandable at most popular restaurants as they can't seat everyone at once  but when you do get sat eventually  you realize that the reason you've been waiting for an hour is because the kitchen takes an hour to even bring out your food once you order it.I went with a couple friends and after telling us the wait was 30 minutes  it ended up being an hour. The greeters were apologetic about it  and once we were sat  the server was very friendly. We ordered our food and waited...and waited...and waited. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich  which is pre-made  with fries. My friends also ordered entrees that would have been pre-prepared so there was really no reason for the wait. What made it worse was once I got my sandwich  it had maybe a spoonful of pulled pork on it. I never ask for a manager but I did to ask if that was a normal portion for that meal  and he took one look at it and before I even said what was wrong  he apologized and took it back to get a larger portion  which took another 15 minutes. He was extremely apologetic and  while I didn't ask for any compensation  he gave me my meal for free. The pulled pork  though  was amazing! And the fries are so good as well...definitely some of my favorite fries of any restaurant (except McDonald's of course).I've been to this location several times and the experience has always been similar (friendly staff but long waits). I like the food  but the experience keeps me away unless my friends are hellbent on eating here.
Elaine Y.,San Francisco  CA,421,828,1298,7/1/2013,3.0,BJ's has a very large menu (upwards of 15 pages) and serves a real hodgepod of items ranging from Asian fusion entrees to more traditional surf & turf dishes. Many of the dishes are calorie-heavy  so watch out. I've come here multiple times and some of my choices were real hits while others were just mediocre. This particular time  I ordered a bison burger and subbed the coleslaw for a watermelon arugula salad. My salad did not have arugula...it was a spring mix of spinach and red leaf lettuce topped with cubed watermelon and feta cheese. I found the mix very tasty. As for my burger  I ordered it medium  but it was definitely overcooked and almost tough to eat. I tried a bit of my mom's thai chicken mango salad. That was delicious. It had mangoes  avocado  sesame seeds  and a mix of bell peppers. Yum. I also tried a little bite of my dad's pulled pork sandwich. It was swimming in BBQ sauce  not really my thing. My brother had the chicken fried steak...it was a HUGE plate. It also definitely looked like a piece of steak compared to other places that serve it as a deep fried hamburger. It came with 2 large pieces served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of steamed zucchini and cauliflower.All in all  BJ's in comparable to the Cheesecake factory...but features some more unique dishes. It's also just a tad cheaper.
Eman D.,San Bruno  CA,0,11,19,6/18/2016,2.0,We come here for the pizookies and Mark the waiter (who never disappoints to be awesome). It is loud and the wait is usually long on the weekends  holidays  and when any major game is on. Gluten free pizookies are worth it though!
Octavia B.,Pittsburg  CA,0,4,1,3/20/2015,5.0,John the manager was amazing! They have a really great team and I can see why! Alicia the server did a great job at making sure my order was correct and I am so happy with that because that's really hard to come by! Overall everything was great and if you want to go to a BJs come to the one in San Bruno! They are truly awesome!!Sincerely a well more than satisfied customer :):):):)
Donald W.,San Francisco  CA,117,186,1318,8/5/2014,1.0,I've got to say that this is by far the worst BJ's that I have ever been to  and I personally used to love this location. This is now the fifth time that my wife and I have come to this particular location in hopes that Service would've become better and within a year and a half span it has only gotten worse.The only reason why I didn't that place a one star is because of two really good employees. First  is the senior manager named Brandi Jordan who's leadership skills showed that she cares about the customers  and although the issues didn't happen on her watch. She made sure to comp our dinner and even invite us back for much better service in the future. Second was a wonderful waitress named Kelly Liu. She wasn't even our waitress been made sure to constantly check up on us after our poor service and continued to apologize as well as do her best to make us happy. It really meant slot because her section was on the opposite side of ours and yet she still made sure to make a terrible situation decent. Now back to the review. It first started off badly when it took 30 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge the fact that we were sitting down in a booth waiting to be served. I had to forcibly grab a waitresses attention just to be given our water. As she was delivering them she gave my wife and I terrible attitude and begin to roll her eyes as if we were disturbing her at her. Really  you have an attitude because paying customers wanna be served. Get over yourself lady.I then asked to speak to the manager on duty which was Brandy. She was just as troubled as to why there was such awful service. This is now 45 minutes into being at BJ's and we still have not received one dish yet. It took another 15 minutes to receive our appetizers by then it had been a full hour since we arrived and we just received our appetizers. Unfortunately for us the cheese sticks were barely warm and the spinach & artichoke dip we ordered were completely cold. So cold and that we sent it back after one bit.An hour and a half after we arrived we finally got our main dish and our mixed drinks. I was truly disgusted to find cakes on filth surrounding my drinking glass. So bad it was everywhere as if know one attempted to wash the glass. I had to send my drinks back. But once again Kelly made sure to apologize for the mix up and made sure that our main course was hot and satisfied our needs. She even brought over new drinks for us and would leave until we were happy. She constantly kept a smile on her face and made sure to explain what was going on. I've learned that no matter how many people they hire and how much time goes by the service at this particular location just continues to get worse and worse. Occasionally you'll find a few diamonds in the rough like Kelly  who really take their job seriously and treat their customers with compassion but unfortunately there's not enough of her to turn around this said establishment. In my opinion if you do go to BJ's only go when it's slow. Otherwise you will be set up for disappointment and considerable letdown. At this point I'm done with this place and refuse to go back  no matter what!!!
Baylie C.,San Carlos  CA,14,15,,1/14/2016,1.0,I've been to this location numerous times  and every time it's been a failure. There's never silverware on the table  and it takes about 15 minutes AFTER your food has arrived to receive any. The front desk people are so unorganized. There will be 3-5 people standing there and they'll do nothing  while 1 employee does all the work. It seems like they hire underage staff who know nothing  just for their looks. (Most of the girls have resting b*tch face) (One girl with a star tattoo on her neck seems to be the only one who knows how to do her job and has customer service skills) I'm absolutely fed up of giving this location chances.
Cassie T.,Western Addition/NOPA  San Francisco  CA,415,92,111,10/5/2014,4.0,I really have no complaints for this restaurant. Good food and good service! I shared calamari with 3 other people  then split a Black and Bleu burger (so good!) and the Cajun shrimp pasta (even better) with someone and spent about $20 including tax and 20% tip. Not super expensive  and pizookies are always a good dessert!!!
Samantha K.,San Francisco  CA,22,14,3,5/15/2014,1.0,Look at the last picture  a friend ordered calamari to go  she got a little ways through and then looked at the piece she had just bitten into.....there was blue gunk oozing out of it.Long story short  she has been in the hospital with Food Poisoning. BJ's you are REVOLTING!
Shaun E.,Milwaukee  WI,469,295,670,6/29/2015,2.0,Great atmosphere! The service was wonderful! The employees were so  so nothing special. Food was ok.
Nile A.,Carlsbad  CA,212,93,32,5/19/2014,2.0,If you live in the area and you're looking for a place to meet up with some friends and grab a beer  then it works.But if you're looking to sit down and have an enjoyable meal  forget it. Service sucks and food takes forever to come. So disappointed I almost want to say I'm never coming back but.. Pizookies!
Rachel A.,Goleta  CA,137,2,,5/31/2016,4.0,Sienna wants her manager to buy her dinner. This place is fine. Pizza was cheesy. Beer was boozy. We left content
Leah H.,Killadangan  Republic of Ireland,0,2,,6/14/2016,3.0,Took an hour to get my food  it wasn't busy  everyone else got their food  terrible service at first as our waitress went walkabouts for about an hour and didn't come near our table. Eventually the manager Erin came out and personally apologised to us. I got my food and didn't have to pay for it at first  I had a previous review up complaining about the service and when Erin saw it she immediately came over and insisted that we not pay for our food. We got a free meal in the end. Erin is very good at her job and dealt with the problem very well.
Donna L.,San Francisco  CA,66,131,172,9/22/2015,3.0,we had the deep dish pizza and other appetizers a couple of weeks ago. The drinks and apps were fine. The deep dish pizza tasted like baked bread with toppings on it. I prefer to have my crispy crust. oh well.
Jillian C.,South San Francisco  CA,174,12,20,3/5/2016,1.0,Literally just left BJs because we were seated for over 20 minutes and no one acknowledged us. I even made eye contact with servers and the manager and nothing. The tables around us were being tended to except us. And just as we were getting ready to leave  the server from the table next to us comes over to wave n play with my baby then walked away. No asking of drink order  no asking if we've been helped or I'll be right back to get your order. Nothing. Thanks BJs. My kids are now hungry n tired from waiting so long.
Nayo M.,Santa Rosa  CA,73,8,21,7/18/2015,4.0,The calamari is always delightful and the drinks are strong. Good experience and reasonable service each time.
Debi L.,San Francisco  CA,0,104,,12/22/2016,4.0,Went here today for lunch with my mom. Being that I am a gluten-free girl  it's always a dilemma of where to eat (gluten is hidden everywhere  not just in bread). Low and behold  BJ's has gluten free items on the menu. Even better  they have gluten-free hamburger buns. This made my day so I ordered a burger. The burger was good. Instead of fries (yes  they can be gluten-filled if tossed in flour) I got a house salad instead. The salad was a good size and very good. My overall experience was great. Our waiter was also excellent. I would go back again. Also  the prices are very reasonable.
alexandria s.,San Francisco  CA,5,42,,11/7/2016,1.0,I went with my friends to celebrate our birthdays. The service was lacking. It took a long time to get our drinks and our food. Food was cold. My friend's salad had wilted lettuce and chew holes in it--I do not know how that got past quality control. We had like 3 different people serving our table and they did not know what was going on with our order--really big lack of communication. We ordered an entre to go and twice they brought it out on a plate. We asked for our dessert like 3 times before we got it and it took forever to get it. The bill took a long time as well we had to keep asking for it. The lady at the table next to us  kept having to ask for her drink. It was an overall unpleasant experience :(
Johnny M.,San Francisco  CA,11,14,,4/28/2016,4.0,I love going to BJ'S to watch the game and drink but the food is kind of basic. .. don't get me wrong it is really good but it would be better if it were a little more like Cheesecake Factory. Service was decent and this def a good spot to eat for a bday but better for a game day!!!!#
Alexis B.,Alameda  CA,243,9,2,5/21/2016,5.0,Jasmine  I think that's what she said her name was  was the sweetest person there! She was definitely very helpful and charming. I give her 5 stars!!!
B T.,Tracy  CA,0,203,52,10/14/2016,4.0,Good came out cold  had the food returned and the assistant manager had everything remade and food was perfect. Great sirloin good service friendly staff. We did not have to wait at all when we walked in.
Josseline M.,Daly City  CA,0,11,4,3/8/2016,1.0,3 people got food poisoned from this place!!!people be aware my mom  my sister and i got food poisoned from this place!!!!! be careful peoplecalled today to make a complaint manager acted like it wasn't a big deal plus she kept hanging up the phone !
Matthew R.,Manassas  VA,16,14,4,5/15/2016,1.0,Wow  should've paid closer attention to the other reviews. Bathroom was nasty which for a guy that loves dive bars is saying something. Additionally  our server forgot our orders  we were told the kitchen was backed up and the manager came out to apologize. The apology would've been nice but he didn't even offer to comp the drinks or the app we ordered (so kinduv an empty apologize). In total we spent $60 for a pretty shitty experience.
Chele D.,Campbell  CA,0,4,,6/15/2016,5.0,We have been to BJ'S about a half dozen times to the San Bruno location. Tonight was by far the best service we have had here. Normally drinks  appetizers and food take way longer than expected but Jimmy made it happen tonight. He was attentive and on it with the service. He was on top of every table he had tonight that was around us. Super friendly and personable. The only way we are coming back to this BJ'S is if Jimmy is our server again!
Michelle T.,San Jose  CA,46,54,67,6/15/2015,3.0,We had the saddest looking (and tasting) Watermelon Salad here - greens weren't fresh and were swimming in Watermelon juice  along with Ahi Poke  also not fresh  Crispy Calamari and Pizookie Trio (wouldn't miss that!). Fortunately  the (pizookie  as well as) staff here are attentive and nice  which somehow made up for the subpar quality of food preparation.
Dave R.,San Mateo  CA,0,9,11,12/12/2016,5.0,I do not get out to eat much anymore but I think BJs has come a long way. I really do not like to eat anywhere else. Everything I try is pretty good!
HEATHER S.,South San Francisco  CA,43,3,1,4/30/2016,5.0,Went to BJ's today for dinner and our server Jessica was amazing! Her bubbly personality and attentiveness made this dinner stop worth while! Would come back again just to have her as our server!
Mike L.,San Francisco  CA,1130,1114,1709,10/18/2012,3.0,Generally speaking  I try to avoid chain restaurants if/when I can. It's not because I think their food is terrible (although it can be at a few places)  but rather a preference to go somewhere unique...and likely better. The two places I'd make the occasional exceptions for? Cheesecake Factory and BJ's (insert dirty joke here).While I generally don't expect much from chain restaurants  the food at BJ's isn't too shabby (Cheesecake Factory is better though). Granted  I've only tried a few things  but it' has been better than what little I've had from places like Chili's and TGI Friday's. While taking in a Giants game after work  my friend and I decided to split an order of the Artichoke Dip appetizer and the BJ's Favorite Pizza (oven baked meatballs  pepperoni  sausage  mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions  and roasted tomatoes).Compared to the Artichoke Dips I've tried at other chains  this one wasn't all that different (yelp.com/biz_photos/FMGN). The dip was a little salty and rich  but I can't complain with the amount of cheese they threw in  nor the amount of chips they gave us. As for their pizza  it's probably the best bet for something good (yelp.com/biz_photos/FMGN). The dough was a little fluffy  but not overly so  and I liked the mix of ingredients (it's essentially a combination topping pizza). Perhaps it was a little heavy on the tomatoes and salt  but no worse than some other pizza joints out there. Really  no complaints.With a solid beer selection (both outside and house brews) to go with their decent food menu  I certainly wouldn't be opposed to making future trips back to BJ's (especially since Gordon Biersch is gone). A beer  pizza  and a giant TV to watch whatever game is on? Sounds good to me (especially if my team wins). Too bad there always seems to be a long wait for a table though.
J L.,San Mateo  CA,0,20,5,5/12/2016,1.0,"Our waitress was horribly rude. We ordered ""boneless wings"" and they came out cold to the touch. The waitress told us that was impossible  and picked up several to feel for herself. She finally takes them back  and when she brings them out  they are 3 different colors. We said we were no longer interested in the wings (for pretty obvious reasons  I\'d say) to which she lectured us that they are not ""wings "" but in fact ""nuggets"" and refused to take them from our table. After waiting 45 minutes for our table  we left without eating."
Edward G.,San Francisco  CA,1,24,17,6/9/2016,4.0,The Southern Fried Chicken sure is top of the line. The boneless  thin slice sits on mash with the works. The caveat is the portion- sadly only one piece. However  this dish makes fried chicken possible on a date or important meeting.
Ahna B.,Montara  CA,661,137,11,8/6/2015,1.0,Wow! I am not impressed at all with this place. BJ's used to be so good when it first opened. Not sure what happened.Service is not so great anymore. Pretty disappointed food taste like its from the freezer and I am not sure who cooks at these locations but yucky. Used to love this place. Don't think I will be returning; there are to many places in the bay that provide quality food  cocktails and service. Server needs to remember he is at work not on the street not to mention he doesn't remember what people ordered and having one bartender during a game does not work after 5 pm. Waited 30 minutes for my cocktail. The only person providing exceptional service is SHAY out on the patio. She should be a manager and she should get a big fat raise. She's efficient  consistent and a very good multi-tasker. I had to send one of my cocktails back because the soda was so flat that it tasted like plastic.
Kristen F.,Washington  DC,64,59,,6/3/2016,3.0,"We stopped in on our way to the airport for some dinner before an east coast flight. Service was good  but a little slower than we hoped. The food was good. The new fried cauliflower appetizer was really good. The place did have a ""wet rag"" smell."
Chris S.,San Francisco  CA,123,121,76,3/18/2016,2.0,The service here sucks. It took several minutes for a server to come with menus. We ordered two drinks and buffalo wings. The wings took over an hour to come to our table. I've always come here  but it seems like the service just goes down the drain each time. I'm taking my money across the street to Jack's!
Mam C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,47,14,10/30/2016,3.0,Good variety off beer  numerous selection. Porter is smooth and chocolate  Hefeweizen is citrusy  wide range in between. Food good but pricy for the portion size
Jaymee F.,South San Francisco  CA,0,6,4,5/1/2016,1.0,Today is the first time my husband got so pissed of with a server/host that he decided to leave and eat somewhere else. It was me  my husband and our 11 mos baby thats sitting in his stroller. We come in at 11am the place is not yet full and there's 4 of them at the door. My husband said table for 3 with a baby  the guy didnt say nothing then looked at the girl beside him  disnt even bother to greet us or just say ok or anything!! Then ny husband told him that maybe we could just leave the stroller somewhere so he can sit us already cos he heard them talking about our big stroller. Then he AGAIN did not bother to say anything. Then they sit us in a round table without a highchair  do you want us to carry the baby while we eat? I dont know whats wrong with these people. It seems like they're not even thinking at all! Worst restaurant ever!!
Merly I.,San Francisco  CA,8,133,14,3/16/2016,2.0,Typical sports restaurant/bar chain.. Would suggest going for the Happy hour deals -check on their website for times!. Today  I was passing through San Bruno and decided I wanted to watch sports  so I decided to stop in BJ'S . My waiter at the bar area was swamped with tables and I had to flag him down just to refill my water!. :(I ordered the Ahi-Salad!. Surprisingly  the salad was enough for one person!. the Ahi slices were fresh (could had been more) ;( but it was full of flavor and texture for my enjoyment.So  during all that time from me flagging down waiter to refilling my water ...he never came back to see how I was doing? Or if I needed anything else?!. I am One paying consumer if I get Great Service I tip very well!! :D in this case  sad to say..I tipped waiter way under (sorry to do that) due to his lack of attention to my table..I was ready to hand him a $10.00 bill..that changed to $3.00 :(
EL P.,Daly City  CA,0,31,70,11/9/2014,4.0,My wife and I come here about once every 1-2 months. The last time we ate here  my wife ordered Thai shrimp lettuce wraps  and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. Thirty minutes later  our food had not arrived. A kitchen manager then came out to say that the shrimp did not pass their quality testing  so the kitchen was making another plate of shrimp lettuce wraps. My wife was given a free bowl of clam chowder while I ate my burger. The shrimp wraps came out shortly thereafter. The kitchen manager also gave us a free pumpkin pizookie (the reason we came for lunch was to try the pumpkin pizookie!). Later on  another manager came by to apologize for our wait and offered to take the shrimp wraps off our tab. I ended up just having to pay for my burger. We will likely still come back. My wife wishes the pumpkin pizookie was on the menu year-round!
Maysa S.,Sacramento  CA,224,4,,5/27/2016,5.0,Tyler Mack is literally what we have been waiting for as a restaurant!!! He's been the best server ever and so sweet!! Thanks Tyler for a great grad experience!! B
Pj A.,San Francisco  CA,620,136,5,4/2/2016,3.0,Been here many times and every single time I always end up regretting what I order due to everything being over priced for the portions taste  and quality of the food. The place is nice. The service can be a little more attentive  but maybe they were having a bad day. eh.
Ana O.,Miami  FL,0,7,5,11/6/2016,1.0,I'm on vacation and this place was convenient. What a terrible experience this was. From the service to food quality  everything lacked. Our order was wrong  very delayed and consequently it was cold when it got here. We asked for the manager twice. When she finally got here she was very apologetic and covered the bill. Overall a bad experience.
workout n.,San Francisco  CA,0,8,1,4/23/2016,1.0,Bad night for BJ's called in the order got there after 35 minutes had to wait another 30 minutes to an hour for a takeout order
Lisa W.,Pacifica  CA,20,3,,5/23/2016,5.0,My son and I went for lunch this Saturday. I love the food here  but usually the service is slow due to the volume of customers. Russell was our waiter and he was an excellent server! For being such a young man  I was very impressed with his attention to detail and promptness. I asked to speak to the manger Andrew to praise Russell's work ethic. They were both very appreciative to get the positive feedback.
Lana T.,San Leandro  CA,46,18,24,3/26/2016,5.0,Shoutout to the best servers James and Rudy for your awesome service tonight! You guys seriously made my night!!
Paul B.,San Bruno  CA,6,18,,4/6/2016,1.0,"This is the LAST TIME I will ever eat at a BJ\'s Restaurant! I keep returning  hoping it will change but it just gets worse. I have operated businesses for over 20 years and can\'t think of a chain restaurant in more diss array. The management obviously doesn\'t care about their customers or the business. Here\'s what\'s wrong with BJ\'s: 1. Food is below average at best!...always undercooked  overlooked  missing standard ingredients/accompaniments  2. Slowest kitchen in the area  hands down  3. Your order will almost always be a mistake  4. The manager will be non existent & often playing with his/her staff in the BOH or FOH  with no regard for their actual job  5. Your waiter/waitress will be brand new with little to no experience and often leave for lengths of time with out checking on you  6. YOU WILL WAIT (on avg.) ""1 hour"" MIN TO RECEIVE YOUR FOOD  7. You will ask to talk to the manager about your food delay and he will cower in the BOH & never come out to address the problem.  8. You will make a reservation only to find out that once you arrive  you will wait another 20-30 minutes while they lie and say ""we\'re clearing your table now"" (that means they never took your reservation).Bottom line....been here probably 12x  with varying size parties  always a problem  managers are a joke  wait staff untrained at best  food is substandard  food is always a hellacious wait  restaurant is dirty  and overcrowded. I feel like applying to run this restaurant as it has so much promise but so much of it is broken! Does the Regional Manager even know what\'s happening with this restaurant? Does the corporation even care? Whomever is the CEO of BJ\'s should be ashamed of this location! It\'s down right awful. I would never recommend this restaurant to even an enemy!!!!"
Tim L.,Honolulu  HI,18,527,3175,6/13/2014,4.0,I just drank here so no food review. BJ's has a large selection of draft beers including Guinness. I was about to do a Guinness but tried their dark beer (forget the name of it) and went with a pint of the home-brewed dark. It was quite good. I happened to be there in the late afternoon and got the happy hour pricing of $4.00 for a pint. Great deal!
Michael K.,Honolulu  HI,39,45,,12/17/2015,1.0,Waited over an hour for our food tonight. Unacceptable when you have a hungry toddler. Yet could have at least gotten her food out first. When our food got here  they forgot my wife's pizza. Waited another 20 min and still no pizza. We decided to leave without it. Asked for water. Never got it. The thing that kills me is all the servers walk around like they don't care. They don't care that you've been waiting over an hour for your food and it shows in their demeanor. If i could  id give this place zero stars. Don't waste your hard earned money here.
Jason S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,4/30/2016,3.0,we've been going in this restaurant for a while now. every visit is different. worse experience is they serve food w/ out water  and utensils on top of that our food is served after 1 hour we ordered.great experience is just recently w/ the server named lovely and she attend us very well.
Elizabeth S.,San Carlos  CA,332,765,335,3/23/2014,4.0,This place has pretty damn good American fare with a page numbered menu. -quite a novel here! There is literally something for everyone  and you can have some good beers or interesting beer concoctions with your meal. I tried the Irish Berry Burst with the Berry Cider and Guiness. It was kind of sweet yet refreshing. -probably not for guys though. My bf hated it.Honesty  all the food we ordered was great. They have a plethora of enticing appetizers. So we did it tapas style and feasted with a menu on the side in case we were hungry for more. The Thai shrimp wraps were about as Thai as the lemongrass included but really scrumptious all wrapped in butter lettuce with a sweet soy sauce to dip in.The stuffed mushrooms... We inhaled them!The Santa Fe spring rolls were filled with chicken  black bean  red peppers and other fresh ingredients resulting in nuances of flavors. They also came with two delectable dipping sauces. That avocado one and some sort of spicy aoli were so good  we were dipping the fried artichoke hearts in there too.All this was not enough  so the bf ordered a cup of chili and me the minestrone. What a way to end a fun meal. The chili was robust and flavorful. My minestrone totally exceeded my expectations with the loaded vegetables  kidney beans and some fusilli. It came with some parmesan to sprinkle on top too.This place is super big and lofty. It has a fun atmosphere with tons of TV's  festive beer motifs and some ornate accessories like fancy mirrors and chandeliers. The murals on the wall are great too. This was our first time at this location  but our server was great. I wish I knew his name  but he was an older bald Asian guy with glasses. -very attentive  personable and solicitious. He got me to sign up for a rewards card and explained the point system. All this great service and knowledge with a joking personality to go with! You bet we'll be back!
Cathy G.,San Bruno  CA,19,43,,3/20/2017,2.0,I used to really love coming to BJ's  but the last few times I have come  it just has not been that good. Today was by far the worst service I think I have ever had. My daughter and I arrived before 3:00 to find the hostess on the phone  which is fine...she stated that she would be just a minute. Also fine. At least she acknowledged us. Fortunately there was a couple of servers up by the host station  and one of them seated us. Our waiter came almost immediately  which was awesome. My problem starts after we actually placed our order. Because of a rainy day  my daughter and I decided to stick with the chicken tortilla soup. Great soup kind of day. Gave our order to our waiter and proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for two bowls of soup. When it arrived  the bowls had hardly any soup in it and what was there was barely Luke warm. Mine had one piece of chicken and one tortilla strip in it. My daughter at least got two chicken pieces in hers  but alas  no tortilla strips. It's really too bad because the tortilla soup is really good! I also had a cup of coffee  which no one ever came back to see if I wanted a warm up or another cup. Our waiter only came back to give us the bill  which he promptly picked up. Took a while to get it back though. By this point  we could hardly wait to leave. I was really very disappointed today
Marcela M.,Daly City  CA,0,15,1,11/13/2015,1.0,Very bad service. Ask for a little something for a friend that was his birthday took them 40 min to come to us and to top it off told us they don't do those things in there. We had about 4 different people in our table. Servers need more training. He was really worry about us paying the check and forgot about providing a decent service. After I talked to the manager which was really nice and hope they will something about it. Don't plane to go back any time soon.
Eva K.,Daly City  CA,267,18,4,3/31/2016,5.0,Antonio is hands down the best server at BJ's. He makes me feel welcomed and at home. He knows the menu inside and out. When I asked for a recommendation he quickly knew what I would like. I would definitely come back because Antonio made my experience worthwhile.
Joey V.,San Mateo  CA,43,5,,4/27/2016,1.0,I just tryed the new hickory bacon burger took 4 bites out of it and had a freaking screw in my burger I mean seriously a screw in my food... I'm pissed right now what if I swollowed that shit... It was even a clean screw it was a dirty one... This is not sanitary just be care what u eat and eat slowly...
A M.,San Francisco  CA,0,27,1,10/24/2016,2.0,It was my first time there. I made a reservation 3 hours in advance and ended up waiting an additional 30minutes. We went because it was online as a sports bar and we wanted to watch the baseball game. There are tv screens all along the perimeter but they are on all different channels. We had to request a table and wait longer to be able to get the area to view the baseball game on a specific tv. My reservation also had the request but we didn't get seated appropriately. Don't ask me why they couldn't change the channel. Anyways  too large and noisy to enjoy a game anyways. No captions on any tv with no volume. Do not go there to watch sports!!! The 20 televisions are just for decoration.
Jimmy R.,Easton  PA,15,17,,10/24/2016,2.0,Had / Has potential....just too much bad to write about...a bad night for BJs...Let's just leave it at that.
AJ C.,Daly City  CA,47,101,302,5/25/2015,5.0,Al is the best server ever! Thank you so much for giving my table a lot of attention. You made my night
Hen A.,San Mateo  CA,2994,3104,4663,1/27/2015,3.0,quite busy and long waits for tables  but open seating at the bar...bar stools or tables mostly full  but pretty easy to spot a table nearly finished...literally under a minute and finding a table at the bar...same menu and better view of sports on the screens...various burgers  pizzas  brews and more...similar larger scale chain restaurant to a gordon biersch or elephant bar...calories on the menu items making choices quite hard...taking the lower calorie option  $10.50 bison burger with a slaw salad...actually quite good...quite juicy...other taking the $11.25 jalepeno burger...gut-busting  messy and good...fries to add even more gluttonous calories...decent food  large space  sports and good cheerful crowd...plan ahead if you want a table...very busy weekends...
Jim C.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,,11/6/2016,1.0,Absolutely horrible experience. Ordered large pepperoni pizza  got slab of dough with almost no sauce and only a little cheese. And one pepperoni per slice. Don't waste your money on this dive folks! Sad  because the chain in Southern California is fantastic.
somel y.,San Francisco  CA,0,21,,10/1/2016,1.0,"Do not understand why people eat here. Why oh why are there lines!?! Actually waited 45 minutes for cold fries  lukewarm appetizers (oh wait  make that part hot  part cold  part something in between)  and funky fish. The ""deep dish"" pizza was all dough  very little toppings. However  unlike the other reviews  my server was actually on top of things and friendly."
Audie C.,San Jose  CA,188,11,1,12/6/2015,4.0,The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was good. I enjoyed it. The waitress was nice. Her name was Daniela T.
Thomas P.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,1,4/16/2016,1.0,Waited over 20 minutes just to get my waiters attention JUST for a dessert ..... 40 mins later I got the dessert horrible just horrible
Jessie F.,South San Francisco  CA,150,43,5,8/16/2015,5.0,Great place to eat at! Got the potstickers for an appetizer and the burger with cheese. Everything was as expected and we had a great server.Will def come back here again!
Bella J.,San Francisco  CA,1,5,3,4/10/2016,1.0,Came here for lunch today with my family and it turn out the service and food quality went down hill. We ordered the bbq chicken salad  bj pizza  shrimp panne pasta and 2 kids meal and some drinks. We waited almost an hour and all the entree came and the pizza was not hot and the bbq chicken salad was still not ready so we end up canceling the salad. After eating I started having a up sad stomach!!! Probably will not come back again!
Bill F.,Burlingame  CA,0,31,,1/13/2016,2.0,I was there early before the lunch hour with a party of 7.  The food was good but the service was poor.1.  After ordering  we had to wait 40 mins before our food arrived. 2.  We had to ask for refills for our drinks.3.  Our glasses were not clean and still had lipstick on some of them.4.  We had to ask for our check twice.It's a great location and I like the interior of the restaurant but service needs to improve.
Kimberly E.,Hercules  CA,935,175,494,1/1/2015,1.0,Very  very disappointed about the service AND the food tonight.My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner here after a New Years Day adventure. And wow... I don't even know where to start. First off  we found an open table at the bar area  so we sat down and waited for someone to serve us. Not long after  someone came up to us  cleared the table and asked us if we would like anything to drink. We ordered two beers  she checked our IDs  and then left us a menu. Just one. And by the time she came back to give us another  we were already set with what we wanted to order. For appetizer  we ordered the the deep fried artichoke hearts. For entree  my boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and I ordered the soup and salad combo (I picked clam chowder and a house salad with vinaigrette on the side). First thing that came to our table was my boyfriend's pasta and my clam chowder. The moment the soup touched my lips  I knew it was not the right temperature. I mixed it and tried to see if it was just the surface that was cold  but my second spoonful clarified that the soup was in fact lukewarm. When the next food-runner came and brought us our appetizer (yes  our appetizer came after our entrees)  I sent my soup back to be warmed. Keep in mind that I ordered a soup and salad combo and my salad still hasn't shown up. Since my boyfriend's pasta was fine  he was pleased. I decided to try the deep fried artichokes. And let me just say... everything in that dish was sour. The artichokes were sour. The dipping sauce it came with was sour. The lemon they garnished the plate with was sour (hahahaha). I ended up asking my waiter for ranch  because it was overbearing. When my warm soup finally came back out  my salad joined in and by that time  I was already losing my appetite. I did take a few more spoonfuls of the soup and a few bites of my salad. But after that  I gave up. Overall  I don't expect much from chain restaurants. But this was just a huge miss.
Alan S.,Redwood Shores  CA,66,58,69,11/6/2015,1.0,Went to BJ's at 1pm on a Friday. Not busy at all  and we were seated promptly. Things kind of went downhill from there. Tried to order a Coke  but they don't serve Coca-cola products. Ordered a root beer  and was told the taps were broken(?). Finally able to get an iced tea. Ordered a bison burger and chicken flatbread. Items took a bit long to arrive  esp considering the place was not busy (I'm guessing it was 20 min?). Then the topper: the server delivered my meal  but then proceeded to pull a hair out from the burger. Yep. I guess it was good that he spotted it  and he did ask the kitchen to re-make the order  but it was pretty gross... Burger was delivered a few minutes later by the manager (why did it get delivered so quickly this time?)  but kind of lost my appetite at that point. Took forever to get the check (server seemed to be talking with another customer throughout our time at the restaurant). When the check arrived  we expected the burger to have been taken off the menu at least  but instead  we were charged TWICE for the order. Finally able to get the second charge taken off but no offer to take off the first or even an apology from the manager.I have thought long and hard about writing this review  especially given the rating  but I think it's completely appropriate given my experience this time  and the 3 other times I've attempted to give BJ's a shot (two other times at the Foster City location  another time here). Every time I've had either lost/wrong order  slow service  food return  etc. I don't consider myself picky  but just not acceptable. Message to BJ's: you are really a disaster. Maybe I've been very unlucky  but I'm not coming back here again and recommending against anyone ever wanting to go there. Your prices put you in competition with places that offer far better quality of food and customer service. I hope you figure it out for the sake of the longevity of your company  but it will not be with my support.
Tori M.,Alameda  CA,29,28,21,11/22/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I talked to the manger Tom and he was very apologetic for the poor service. He accommodated me with a gift card to dine there again and the service and food was great this time. Definitely will be coming back. I appreciate how he reached out to me. It shows how they strive to please their guests.
Mona A.,Daly City  CA,17,34,46,3/25/2015,5.0,I always get good food and awesome service when I come here! The food was very fresh & tasty. I was seated within 2 minutes of walking in. Btw  Alaa is an awesome waitress!
Andre D.,San Bruno  CA,15,70,23,2/19/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Just got here they seated us and had us sitting in the back for 10 min before some one asked us if we had a server. We said no. Waited 5 more min and walked out. I'm goin to round table!!!
Marie M.,San Diego  CA,0,101,4,3/14/2016,2.0,We were starving and in the area so we popped into BJs. Unhappy that I didn't read the reviews first. It was pretty busy so we grabbed a seat in the bar. Our server came over and because it was raining we chose not to risk drinking. We ordered waters and we got an eye roll. It may have been imagines so I ignored it We ordered dinner and my mothers meal was incorrect. She ordered tacos and got a sandwich. The runner said he'd look into it. Our server came by a few minutes later and said she misheard but then said she only ordered to what my mother was pointing to. She never pointed to anything  her hand was resting on the menu She said the order would be expedited and it would be 5 minutes tops 15 or 20 minutes later as my food sat iced cold she said that shrimp took a long time which is why it couldn't be expedited. It was sauted shrimp 3 minutes on each side. The entire meal and evening was ruined by someone who couldn't do their job
Nunya B.,Chatsworth  CA,0,11,,3/25/2015,2.0,I was looking for a nice place to eat close to my hotel & thought I would check this place out. First  several parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Then I realized if you go here with children of ANY age (mine was 11)  you will be exiled and made to sit in the indoor 'patio area' directly in front of the malls main entrance. At this point the restaurant feel is gone as you watch herds of shoppers coming in and out of the front door  not to mention the loud echoing  which overall makes it feel like an overpriced meal in the mall food court. When directly asked about the children issue they denied this was there tactic. I went to this mall the next two days and all the tables on the 'patio' were filled only with families with children. So wrong.
Chito D.,San Mateo  CA,0,2,,10/6/2016,1.0,Worst service experience yet. Waited for more than an hour to get a dinner table and another 30 minutes to wait for a server to give our order. We just left. Cant wait any longer. There were vacant tables and they are not short of servers.
Ema M.,San Mateo  CA,0,11,,3/28/2017,1.0,This place is ridiculous. I called on a Saturday and asked them if they would Be able to accommodate a party of 9. They said it would take an hour  so I put my name on their wait list  showed up an hour later and when checking in they told us they can only seat us in two separate booths that are next to each other. I had explained to them that when speaking to someone who put my name and party size on the wait list that I was not told it would be in booths. The host called over the manager and she talked to the host right in front of us and then the host relayed the message  the manager didn't even have the curiosity to talk to us (we were literally standing two feet away). The host said their tables were booked for the whole night and said they only had booths and told us to next time tell them we want a table. Why would a party of any size want to go out to eat to be seated separately ?! Needless to say we had to find a restaurant last minute to accommodate our party.
Amber Leila E.,Norristown  PA,22,13,10,3/2/2016,4.0,Decent mojito good aps!decent mojitos.. Don't muddle mint properly. Good appetizers wanted the avocado egg role but it's like1080 calories!! Nice server
Natalie M.,San Francisco  CA,281,453,250,4/3/2014,4.0,I personally enjoy BJ's. The food isn't AMAZING but it's pretty consistent  but it's pretty darn good.Get the stuffed mushrooms  and try the lettuce wraps with shrimp. Delicious. Also  deep dish pizza anyone? They are so great. I've tried the bbq chicken  and vegetarian. Deep dish is so delicious. They also have great flatbread appetizers (California club).Their happy hours are at random times (I think even at 10pm on some days)  but they have great drink specials. Some of their drinks are strong. They have skinny margaritas as well. Woo! Fun place but it gets super duper crowded. Sitting at the bar  you don't have to wait as long but those seats fill up fast. Expect to wait from 30 min to an hour.
Luke S.,San Mateo  CA,416,1198,,3/30/2014,3.0,This place has great beer . I gotta give it to them for that.  The ribs I thought were pretty bland   very easy to get off the bone tho and the baked potato was ah okay.  I like the crowd here and all the tv's they have . The service is really good too cuz although they get really busy they make sure to still give excellent service.
K T.,San Francisco  CA,4,62,27,6/23/2015,4.0,MAIN COURSE: 3 STARS DESSERT: 5 STARS I ordered the sirloin with cheesy mashed potatoes and string beans (about $16...this steak dish comes with two sides that you can choose from like soup  fries  mashed potatoes  veggies  etc. ) I was very excited  but when I got it  everything was in very small proportions--I was shocked! The string beans and mashed potatoes were great  but the steak was not. When I order sirloin elsewhere  it is not grainy (for lack of a better word...please reference my pictures). It was juicy  but the texture was so off putting! It did not taste like steak at all. The dessert was AMAZING. We ordered a 3 pan pizookie plate (about $10)  and it was so worth it. You get to choose which three cookie flavors you'd like to have. We chose the double chocolate  white chocolate and macadamia  and a regular cookie--all topped with vanilla ice cream. The white chocolate was surprisingly less sweet compared to the other two. The double chocolate wasn't as sweet as I had expected it to be. The regular cookie was my favorite though. Bottom line: -BJ's can be pricy  but there are more budget-friendly meals on the menu. -do NOT order the sirloin -GET THE 3 PAN PIZOOKIE PLATE. SO WORTH IT.
L D.,Raleigh  NC,0,37,,9/9/2016,1.0,By far the worst service we have had at a restaurant in a long time. Waiter was happy to take drink orders  awhile later took food and drink refill orders. We were a table of four  it took about 45 mins before everyone was fully served. First food came out after 20 mins  next order 10 mins later and last order 15 mins later  only after we flagged someone down. Then came the drink refills. And the place wasn't even crowded. Only go here if you aren't really hungry or in a hurry. Def we aren't returning. Oh  no apologies from anyone nor a manager-type to visit our table.
Kevin Z.,San Francisco  CA,124,33,13,12/28/2014,1.0,Mediocre service. I brought my girlfriend in for dinner and after waiting  we were seated to a table that had not been cleared and cleaned yet. Waitress paid no attention to us it took 10 minutes before she approached us to offer us beverages or starters. We were given dirty plates with dried sauce still on it  to use for the pizza. After telling the waitress  she disputed my claim by saying that's nothing on the plates before I corrected her and gave me replacements. It didn't help that she came out with the wrong size pizza I ordered and tried to blow it off by saying it was what I ordered. This is not to mention  she never came back with the ranch dip i asked for! 30 minutes later and I'm still sitting here waiting for my pizza. Also  beware of the sanitation of the restaurant staff. My girlfriend saw a waitress in the restroom not wash their hands before returning to work. YUCK!
Don M.,Corona  CA,0,6,5,11/30/2016,1.0,If I could give it a zero I would. This is not typical of service I would expect at this restaurant. This was a not overly crowded night at all  we were seated immediately. I had to get up out of my seat and ask another server to locate my server after several servers passed by. The service was slow  And although our server was nice it was overshadowed by the slowness and inattention to getting orders serving the food and overall non-customer friendly atmosphere. food was OK  at least we didn't get sick  and my strawberry lemonade was lukewarm with approximately five ice cubes in it. I had to ask for water twice before I received it after another long delay. there was no silverware at the table. When I receive good service  I will be the first to write about it  but the service was absolutely unacceptable. If not for the fact we just arrived out of town on a flight and had no other restaurant alternatives nearby we would've gotten up and left. I intend to write the corporate office and hope that this location will be contacted and some additional training or soft skills maybe offered to it's employees. if I could have located a manager I would have expressed my concerns and dissatisfaction to them but there was none to be found. You've been warned.
Jose O.,Belmont  CA,34,17,2,2/2/2014,1.0,My girlfriend and I walked in and there was no wait. We were sat right away and were greeted by the waitress within a couple minutes and had our drinks a couple minutes after that. We ordered cheeseburgers  figuring that they'd be fast. 20 minutes later  still no food. The waitress walks by and apologizes for the wait. 20 more minutes pass  people that showed up well after us got their food. The waitress completely disregarded us and even walked the long way around when she picked up dirty plates. I waited 5 more minutes and walked out. Horrible service. I'll never go back.
Coco C.,South San Francisco  CA,50,97,2575,5/17/2015,3.0,My hubby wanted to eat lunch here today and the service is never consistent. Good thing our food was great and yummy. As far as our waiter that looked like Pierce Brosnan...he was so unpleasant  I should have something to the Manager in charge. 04.29.15
Rick K.,Sunnyvale  CA,14,104,33,12/7/2015,2.0,"Been to the bar here many times for sports events. Never had a problem. Dining at this location has always been a crap shoot. Last night\'s experience was no different.  BJ\'s is ""churn and burn"". Servers are young and often inattentive. They attempt to take your entire order  stack each course up on the table before you\'ve had a chance to enjoy or barely taste your appetizer  salad or soup. There were 4 of us this evening and no one got a refill  2nd beer  ice tea  etc without first flagging down a staff member who then called our server. Being familiar with this style of service  I simply don\'t order all at once which forces the server to space the courses out a bit and actually allows us to enjoy the food. It wasn\'t a Friday evening with a long wait. There were several empty tables in our server\'s station and he could have done a little better. Our appetizers were tasty  but my wife\'s Asparagus salad didn\'t come with its asparagus. We mentioned it... but it never came. Another member in our party never got her salad either. Once again  we mentioned it  but it too  never came.In the end  a manager ended up crediting us for about 1/3 of our bill. We didn\'t ask for this  but clearly he was aware of the mistakes  which didn\'t seem to stop. We skipped dessert."
Lisa D.,Elk Grove  CA,0,10,2,12/10/2015,5.0,Love their egg rolls come here all the time friends family its awesome service is great I recommend to come to this restaurant with friends family
Donyell A.,San Tan Valley  AZ,153,35,36,1/26/2016,3.0,Stopped in for a quick bite during happy hour. I've been here plenty of times. I ordered hot wings ( flat pieces only) and something for my daughter. My order came and it wasn't as I ordered and the waitress said they didn't have any extra flat pieces?????? This is not my first time here or ordering this way. The waitress ordered me a new plate so I was satisfied.
D M.,San Jose  CA,29,8,1,3/4/2016,2.0,More of bar food rather than restaurant food. Calamari was not seasoned but sauces were provided on the side. They had very small crispy fries which might as well be called potato sticks/chips. Meat lover's pizza was extremely salty with an overwhelming flavor of ham. Service was okay but a long wait for the food when it is pretty packed.
Hank F.,Rialto  CA,20,20,,7/24/2016,3.0,The food is good  service is a mixed bag. All all friendly but it's kinda messy upfront getting checked in no real line people get help out of order. Mostly putting this review out because the carpet really stinks. Especially the whole back area. Please  steam it or just get rid of it!!!!!
A. J. Dex C.,San Francisco  CA,145,27,6,2/2/2015,1.0,Walked in the bar which was empty at the time. Instead of getting helped  was ignored by every waiter that insisted on helping everyone who had sat down after me....I wouldn't expect amazing service in a self seating bar  but I am incredibly disappointed in the wait staffs inability to communicate their assigned tables to each other. Sitting for over 20 minutes waiting for someone to help me is a bit past forgiveable. Being curious I waited for how long it would actually take. Once she dropped a menu she proceeded to help two other tables that had just arrived. It took about 30 minutes to get my drink on a slow Monday. Let's not even talk about how long it took to get my food order in.Sad.
Sonny Q.,South San Francisco  CA,0,77,17,11/16/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Ordered avocado roll  spinach artichoke dip and fried calamari. Got the spinach (bland) and calamari (average). After a few minutes they brought us a wrong order for the avocado roll. Name of server is Alexis. I end up having the avocado roll for To go. We ordered also hot green tea and raspberry ice tea. When we got green tea  it was warm & on a mug. Usually they give you an envelope of the tea & hot water. Alexis probably just re warm the mug after we complain. Also I asked for refill of my raspberry tea & she just added water over it or the refill tank for the tea was empty. Poor quality of service. We were suppose to get entry food but end up going home. Try Jack's across the street or Crepevine in Burlingame next time.
Caitlyn C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,10,12,11/22/2016,1.0,My boyfriend and I tried to give BJs a second chance after a bad previous experience months ago. When we came in tonight we waited 25 minutes to be seated  neither of us minded. Our waiter was amazing and very helpful  but when it came to the food it was DISGUSTING and I would never come back because of it. I ordered a gluten free bacon guacamole burger  when it came out the first time it was on a regular bun...our waiter took it back and was greatly apologetic for the mistake. We waited 15 more minutes while his food was on the table getting cold. When I received my food again the bun was hard as a rock  I told our waiter and he offered to get me a new bun but I was so hungry I declined and contributed eating. As I took a bite nearing the center of the burger I found myself with a mouthful of cold uncooked ground beef. Although the staff was willing to make amends for the food  I would never come back again.
Janet T.,San Mateo  CA,3288,189,1,10/7/2014,3.0,Oops....almost forgot to write this review from last week.Met my BFF here for just a beer and the Avocado rolls here after we went shopping for an upcoming event. It was one of those HOT days  we decided to drop in since my BFF lives not far from BJ's.Anyway the Avocado rolls were delicious and darn that beer (Corona) tasted good. But service was a little spotty. But that's typical. I've been to BJ's many times over the years.Parking was tricky. BJ's was very busy!
Andie T.,Glendora  CA,262,5,,3/16/2016,5.0,ate dinner on the patio tonight and the service was great! Ordered a beer and a couple appetizers and the meals were coursed perfectly! Our server  Charles  checked back regularly to make sure everything was great. The manager Krystal came by and touched the table and made the experience that much better. Would definitely recommend!!
Jay D.,Concord  CA,93,37,1,3/15/2017,1.0,So I have a number of issues I have experienced during the last month which is funny since we go on non peak times when most of the staff are just standing around. Being the supposed decent dessert place opened late in San Bruno  its not like there is another alternative to go elsewhere so apparently give BJs more chances than it deserves  though HOOTER's San Bruno has permanently burned a page in my book. Honestly you'd think the pazookie was one they have mastered and could not screw up. WRONG! So we ordered a total of 5 pazookies  which normally they are cooked well with crispy bottoms. though these was really doughy  had a grainy consistency and by morning I at least know two of us experienced stomach issues. It honestly does not seem like things will get better  which I agree with other posts that if it wasn't the closest thing that sold dessert opened late  it probably wouldn't still be in business. You can view by amount of dislike for the brand that if another late night spot like a buffalo wild wings came in that it would destroy the BJs since people like Diane who work there give it a lousy name though she is one of a few people who work for the BJs brand who experience a piss poor attitude and lack of urgency that they experience more time fraternizing and ignoring the request of their clientle. Probably also would have been better if they at least acted like they wanted to help and smiled. I hope BJs does what Chipotle did and hold a company wide meeting to improve quality and the face of their brand. Oh and I forgot to add that my appetizers tend to be non existent since they usually are burnt beyond the point of where they can even be consumed where my potato skins essentially were literally just the skin since they were burnt to the point where the potato itself didn't exist anymore.
Liz G.,Bayview/Hunters Point  San Francisco  CA,0,11,4,7/7/2015,5.0,I love Bj's its my favorite restaurant so far!I always get the parmesan crusted chicken. Tastes so delicious and the drinks are nice it would be nice if they always had special drinks tho but cant complain love this place!!!Forgot to mention the staff is very nice and accommodating  the service is usually busy but to me they always try their best to give customers a good service
Yesenia C.,San Diego  CA,625,236,106,11/22/2013,3.0,Bj  love coming here mainly because I absolutely love the avacado egg rolls and the wedge salad is super good. This location has a pretty small bar and not many TV's it's actually overall a smaller location so it gets really really busy.The service is just ok I been here a few times and nothing too special. You can call ahead and put your name down over the phone as long as your there with 30 minutes.
Christina X.,Millbrae  CA,247,45,11,1/5/2016,4.0,great atmosphere! servers are usually super nice and helpful. the seating is super comfy. good place to watch sports! the bar is the best place because the TVs might be hard to see in the regular seating area. The bar is first come first serve so it might be a little hard to find a place to sit on game days. Happy hour is extended when there's a football game on! Great place  but I give it 4 stars because they stopped putting a sugar rim on the cup of my strawberry lemonade.
M T.,South San Francisco  CA,0,191,,8/22/2016,4.0,Lots of menu choices for food  beer  and drinks. Prices reasonable. Portions large. Service was excellent the night we went for dinner in August 2016 (party of four). Bill was $113.90 before tax and tip  for which we got: 1 appetizer  4 entrees  4 alcoholic drinks (one glass of wine  two beers  one prosecco)  and 2 desserts (both single scoops of ice cream). The most expensive entre our arty ordered was the full rack of BBQ ribs ($22.95). The least expensive entre was the beef sliders with fries ($11.50)  but even at that low price there were four medium size sliders and a lot of fries (a good value. I will return.
Robert F.,Daly City  CA,1,5,,1/18/2015,2.0,Went there for Sunday Brunch. There was no wait and our server arrived promptly. He politely took our drink orders and came back with our drinks and took our meal orders. That's when our good luck ran out. My coffee arrived in a dirty cup and with a soup spoon. We got that resolved when our waiter finally brought the appetizer but were then left to enjoy it with our hands until the waiter swung by again to check on us and noticed that we had no utensils or napkin setup. This was also resolved with its attendant wait so that when the food arrived  we were ready to eat. Unfortunately  while the food was just fine  my order was incomplete. This took more time to resolve. We had earlier mentioned to our server that we would be ordering more food to go and when we added this to our order  the waiter took great care in making us believe that he was paying attention to get it right. Unfortunately  when the check came  it was incorrect. We got this additional problem resolved and decided to not protest the $3.25 charge for toast that I thought came with my meal. We're were treated to watching the folks at the table next to us arguing over their check with their waiter and wondered if there is a training issue here or a deliberate pattern. We finished our meal and did not have to wait long for our takeout. We discovered that the $5.25 charge for Mac-n-cheese bought us about 7oz in a 16oz cup. The drink was $9.95 and the Bison Burger was un-satisfyingly small. My final impression is that while the food is fine and the waiter personable & accommodating  the sheer number of issues that needed to be resolved  coupled with the cost  and wait all combine to put this place on my avoid list.
Richard S.,Fairfield  CA,0,8,2,3/8/2016,1.0,What a miserable experience. Mens room was something straight out of a nightmare. Urine all over the floor plus after mentioning it to the bartender nothing was done even after he said it was. Kind of hard to eat a meal after you use the restroom wash your hands and feel like you need to shower afterwards. Never again will I eat or enter this place again.
Sheila M.,Daly City  CA,0,6,4,9/4/2016,2.0,First and most likely last time here. Swrvice was very average. We sat waiting for our food for nearly 20 minutes and our server never really checked in to see how we were or let us know what was going on. Yet he was *very* attentive to the table next to us. WTF? Food was not thrilling & when they brought it  one of the sauce containers had spilled all over the entree. Definitely NOT coming back. Ever.
Joan H.,Moorpark  CA,0,20,,9/3/2016,1.0,I was visiting my daughter and before dropping me off at SFO we decided to stop and get a late lunch. It started out fine  got seated quickly  waitress took our order. When our salads arrived they looked great. As we started eating a beetle crawled out of my daughters salad! I tried to flag down a server with no luck. I went up to the front and interrupted 2 employees chatting. The guy came to our table and saw the beetle crawling on the plate and removed the food to the back and said he would have someone come over. After waiting 10-15 minutes and no one coming to our table I went up to the front and asked the hostess to get the manager. I waited there for about 10 minutes and asked again for manager. She said he is in his office and said he should be out soon. I waited up front a while longer and could see the manager coming this way but stopping to talk to some staff along the way. When he finally got to me he asked what I wanted. I told him about the beetle and instead of apologizing he asked what type of beetle it was and what it looked like! When I told him I didn't know what type and did that really matter  it crawled out of the salad! He said he would give me a gift card if that would help. I did take the gift card but I'm not sure if I will ever go to a BJs again and I know for sure I will never go back to this one. This was the worst manager I have ever dealt with and they need to have better kitchen health department checks.
Chef B.,Belmont  CA,46,12,5,1/2/2015,1.0,UNSANITARY alert : I ordered the jalapeo burger MR and fries. Took 45 minutes to arrive 1) the food was cold ..not even room temp..it was cold  when I asked the waiter to throw it back on the grill I got major attitude he took it and came back 5 minutes later with the same cold burger..I was too hungry at that point so I just started eating it ..BUT..the major and very nasty thing happened when I realized there were bits of white paper towels (not the same color of the napkins that are on the tables ) IN my fries...I mean it looked like they tossed the fries with bits of white paper napkins...when I told the waiter he looked at me like I just cursed his mother and asked if I wanted another one....when I said no just take it off the bill   I got nothing but more attitude ...Health code violation seems to be a norm here   I know because I'm a chef and have worked in the field as a professional for over 10 years ... Not only is the food nasty  service slow  and waiters awkwardly rude  but don't be surprised of you find unsanitary things in your food. The front of the house manager replied to my complaint by saying ; yeah I'll let the kitchen know ...if those where my cooks  they'd be written up/fired so serving unsanitary things.I'd recommend no one to waste money or risk a food borne illness from this place. I still feel a bit sick after eating here . Waiters are awkwardly rude  service sucks  food is unsanitary and management doesn't seem to really care . Hopefully they get a health dep. inspection in the very near future .
Amelia D.,San Francisco  CA,63,15,80,7/19/2015,4.0,We went here for lunch time and we had to wail long time ( about 1 hours) for food . The food is great but the services have some problems. I hope they improve not to keep customers waiting !!!
Jacob K.,Fresno  CA,1,4,,2/16/2016,1.0,Horrible service. Got seated and waitress forgot about us and got other people that had been seated after us their orders first. Food was ok but nothing to brag about. Just got back into the US and was hungry and it was not what I was hoping for.
Haley F.,Plymouth  NH,0,1,,3/13/2016,5.0,First time coming here while vacationing from New Hampshire. I've heard all about the pzookies so when I saw one was near our hotel I knew I had to try it. Our server was Tyler and he was super friendly and very attentive. We got an appetizer and then we waited a little while for our meal  but we were both fine (I'm a waitress so I understand when things can take more time than others). Even so the manager made sure to stop by and apologize for the wait. Food was all absolutely delicious  overall a great experience.
Lynne F.,San Jose  CA,5,40,,9/28/2014,3.0,"It\'s reassuring to read everyone else\'s reviews about the horrible service because I couldn\'t believe how badly we were treated like at this place. BJ\'s San Bruno: A series of unfortunate events:1) 10 minutes before we had anyone come to our table and ask us for our drinks (11:40am on a Sunday)2) Our server handing me 5 sets of utensils to distribute to the rest of our party instead of laying them on the table3) Our ""deep dish pizza"" looking like DiGiorno\'s in depth and taste 4) Our server saying that that really is how they serve deep dish pizza and pointing at the pizza tray as if ""deep dish"" refers to 2-inch baking sheets and not type of pizza we should be expecting. (For the record  we\'ve been to other BJ\'s locations that had true deep dish pizza  in baking accessories and in actual pizza.)5) Another server admitting that there was something wrong with their fridge which is why the pizzas weren\'t coming exactly like they normally do  but doing nothing to improve the situation.6) Our party looking for the manager and finding no one.7) Overall douchiness of our server. Think Mendez from Orange Is The New Black. We were really debating on whether or not to pull a LeSean McCoy and give a $0.20 tip. We didn\'t end up doing so  but I totally understand where he\'s coming from.3 stars because the tomato bisque soup  french toast and spinach and artichoke dip were actually decent. Don\'t get the Happy Hour boneless wings because you\'ll get 6 teeny pieces of chicken."
Cameron C.,Tustin  CA,0,14,1,3/1/2016,1.0,Just arrived to the unmanned reception. Waited 7 minutes and got a lecture from the hostess. Sat outside another 15 watched people seated afterwards get served. Finally gave up and left. Never again!
Kelley w.,Pacifica  CA,17,24,24,11/17/2015,5.0,I don't know why people bash this place. It's pretty cool with a large menu and TVs everywhere. 5 stars for a nice clean bar and great job from Keith made my meal great.
Annie J.,San Francisco  CA,283,116,,3/27/2015,4.0,I like this place! Always easy to pop over for a drink  and the bartenders are super nice. Pizookies are awesome (be careful  they are little but pack a punch). I've also had the deep dish which was OK  but overall great place to come in the san bruno area if you want a quick bite and good atmosphere. Also a great place to come for a game.
Silvia B.,San Francisco  CA,0,6,,11/4/2015,2.0,This used to be one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants. The past couple of times we have gone the brought the wrong order to our table and we had to wait almost an hour for a hamburger while all the people around us got their food right away. The waiters don't seem to be as attentive as before. I wonder if the Manager has changed? services seems to be going downhill for sure!
Michael C.,Daly City  CA,269,31,,1/5/2015,4.0,Pizookie: Hot Cookie + Cold Ice Cream. Also pasta  pizza  sandwich  original beers on tap.Family and friends will enjoy this place.
Liz D.,La Riviera  CA,110,410,40,1/19/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Every time I come to BJ's sit at the bar. It's more entertaining. Keith is ALWAYS awesome. My sister and know him on a first name basis. He's super friendly. I see how he introduces himself to customers. Dante is also super. I thought Dante was a bartender  he's not. He's working to get promoted to waiter. He should be  he's ready. Very friendly and helpful. It's the great service that keeps me coming back at BJ's. I do wish they offered more vegetarian options such as a portobello or a roasted vegetable sandwich. I usually ordered appetizers that have no meat. Also I love the Grand Cru beer. It's their seasonal beer and it becomes permanent. It's super delicious.
Jeremy E.,Pacifica  CA,85,11,,2/24/2016,1.0,Called in order for pick up at lunch was told be ready in 15 mins. 5 employees standing around no acknowledgement. Poor customer service all these chicks were mean mugging. Food still not ready 90mins later.When finally got food SURPRISE...ITS Cold. The entire experience made me lose my appetite. Go to RED ROBIN!!
James A.,South San Francisco  CA,0,2,,8/22/2016,3.0,Been coming here for a while and man  it sucks that the quality of this place has gone down quite a bit. The service is alright  but the food is beginning to taste a bit plain. I'm worth giving it another try but only as a last resort for a night out.
Tina M.,South San Francisco  CA,0,2,7,2/2/2016,3.0,Last Saturday we were there for dinner my friends and I. At the beginning the service was terrible!!! There was a waitress by the name of Jasmin. She must have been the rudest waitress  the way she talk to my friends. My friend asked to talk to the manager. The manager's name was James  he was very respectful and helpful. After we had an encounter with James. The service was much better. The waiter we got his name was Miguel. He was a very good waiter. James the manager made sure that the night would be pleasant for us. If more managers like James in restaurants would have a five-star review from other guests!!!
Tina C.,San Mateo  CA,15,27,55,10/26/2014,1.0,Literally was just at this BJs like 20 mins ago. When we walked in the hostesses just looked at us like why are you here? They didn't say hi or anything and we had to ask for a table for 2. We got seated and after a few mins the waiter came over and asked us if we wanted drinks and appetizers. We ordered waters and told him we were all set to order. He said okay and then he left without taking our orders. Then 5 mins later another girl came and brought us water.The waiter didn't come back so we drank the water and left. Now we are at Chili's down the street receiving much better service.
Allison M.,Daly City  CA,3,17,4,11/16/2014,2.0,The only reason i am giving this a lower rating is their service. Where do i begin...I LOVE BJS. I have been to many bjs and was excited to find one in tanforan. Boy was i wrong. I will not be going back. This is my 4th shot trying this one out .... And i know why my boyfriend hates coming here. Service is slow.. They always forgrt something... Their drinks are... Eh.I ordered a side salad last time. Did not arrive. I ordered appetizers this time... They tried to put them AFTER our food came out  apologizing that they never made it out.I think i will pass. So unfortunate because i truely love a pizza or appetizers and drinks here.I tried!!! And now i wont be back... Maybe just to go.
Jean Paul D.,Daly City  CA,140,1,,1/14/2016,5.0,"Today was a good day. Rome was not built in one day though if your server\'s name is Leggio you may find yourself in the best seat in the house with classy  friendly service that makes you want to eat as slow as possible. Haha  it was really good service today though. My girlfriend and I had a bogo entree that expires today at 3. We walked in  did not have to wait at all. The hostess carefully walked us down the busy walkway and that\'s when Leggio noticed my awkward gait and offered to seat us in his section. ""VIP"" he adds. He chose to seat us at a large booth that could have accommodated a small family or a group of friends. We had a lot of space which was great for me because I hadn\'t taken my medication yet and my legs were hurting. And so we ordered a Dr pepper and a glass of water which were promptly delivered. We then started with calamari and potato skins. For our entrees we chose the unlimited soup and salad and the portabello burger with thin fries. Before the appetizers came out I finished my doctor pepper and Leggio quickly notices and refills ""back with the doctor"". Just what I ordered. The food was amazing. By far  one of the most memorable experiences at bjs. My baby and I can eat here forever. :) Build dat rome"
Lourdes A.,San Bruno  CA,8,44,2,6/29/2016,2.0,Slow service that is all I can say!!! Waitress does not come to our table to ask if we need anything else or how we are doing. Need to hire more waiter/waitress
Charlene H.,Chicago  IL,0,23,,10/17/2015,2.0,We are on vacation and tried this restaurant. The ambiance and modernization of the building is enticing which is how we entered the restaurant. The host was non friendly. Our waiter was nice enough but slow with our order and revising out table. This is all forgivable. The problem was the food. Everything was overcooked. Out calamari came out dark brown and super crisp. Then our chowder came out watery. Then the ribs came out overcooked and dry. And last our dessert the cookie came out overcooked and hard to get out the pan. We complained to the manager who was very apologetic but this did not change the quality of the food. If you like dining out and want a wow experience run from this place.
Brittney V.,San Francisco  CA,60,32,,9/23/2014,1.0,F!! F F F!! I've given this place so many chances and every time I have had shitty service. Waiters are slow  hostesses have attitude  and every time a manager has to step in (which is often)  it's always someone new. Hmm...I am done with you BJ's. I don't care how close you are to my apartment. And your tap water actually tastes like tap water!!
Shadi K.,San Francisco  CA,93,167,114,11/7/2014,1.0,Ordered some food to Go. Half way thru the salad  long black piece of hair appears. Group had to stop eating and dispose of all the food  waste of money and time. Sanitation is a MUST and should be taken more seriously. Please don't tamper with people food and enforce a better cleanliness policy because apparently the existing one isn't working.
Samantha T.,Berlin  Germany,217,136,17,12/31/2014,4.0,Love this place!!! They have a huge menu and everything I have tried has been delicious. One star off because their house klsch would make a real german sad  but their other beers were better. Service is good  food is yummy  atmosphere is fun  and prices are justified.If you're coming here for dinner  prepare to wait! This place is usually pretty crowded at night.
Kirandeep S.,Stockton  CA,14,13,11,8/12/2014,1.0,"Where do I even begin.... This BJs restaurant  is probably the worst restaurant I\'ve ever been to in terms of service!!!I asked for a spoon and the waitress NEVER came back with a spoon for my soup..So I sat there and stared at it  until I could get another server\'s attention  and he took his sweet time too. I\'ve been to this restaurant about 6 times  each time I go in hoping for things to be better but I\'m disappointed every time.Also  BEWARE  sometimes if you ask to speak to a manager  some of the servers will come to your table posing as a ""service manager"" to try and resolve matters on their own without involving the REAL manager!The food here has not been satisfying  either...almost as crappy as their service! DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
Toni S.,Daly City  CA,3,28,28,8/27/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Horrible horrible service. Server was non attentive  order was wrong  couldn't get the attention of the server to even make the correction. When the order finally came it was burnt and had to be sent back  which took another long wait. Really don't plan on coming back........
Emma L.,Tahoma  CA,28,27,2,11/1/2014,2.0,2 stars because our server was nice. But the pizza would have been better if it was made out if card board. My mojito was 9.50 and literally had no alcohol in it I'mOffended and will never be coming back
K G.,Shreveport  LA,0,1,,8/6/2016,4.0,Mark made our visit perfect! Between his fun conversation  great food recommendations  and directions to local attractions  this first stop in the San Francisco area was perfect!
Michael L.,Oakland  CA,1250,558,2237,5/30/2011,5.0,I love BJ's. Probably even more than the next guy.  I really think a general rule for most writing reviews is to give chain restaurants one less star just because it's a chain restaurant. I refuse to fall in to the category.The BJ's here at Tanforan mall is a great place to meet up with friends  enjoy good food  and hang out. Not formal at all  so my jeans and t-shirt work fine. Flat screens all around to satisfy my sports needs. When with a date  the game is a great way to change the topic with my date if I don't like where the conversation is going.The buffalo wings and avocado rolls are scrumptious. Southwestern Pizza is a delicious  high caloric nightmare-ish treat. And if you want to leave feeling like a real fat a-s  a baked potato and a pizookie will finish the evening off perfectly.At BJ's you are gonna get good basic brewery food. Don't expect Joel Robuchon to be cooking in back. Expect pretty decent bar food  with good beer  and ok service.
Allie W.,Alameda  CA,162,96,10,11/4/2014,1.0,"I was just going to let Sunday pass  chalk it up to  ""Its a stupid chain like they give a shit about food."" But when your WHOLE TABLE gets FOOD POISONING the next day  SOMETHING IS UP. - Forgot we signed up for a table  when we checked in 20 min later to show our buzzer the front desk claimed we never signed up. ???? How do we have a buzzer if we never signed up? Yeaaaaaaah...- Two of our cups of water and one of our forks were filthy. Like...Food caked on it filthy  what the fuckery. - Food was meh  I had cesear salad and clam chowder. Tasted like everything came from a can  including the lettuce. My brother asked for avocado on his sandwich and only one side had it - had to flag down the waiter to get an extra piece. My boyfriend was happier that he was done with his sandwich and didn\'t have to deal with his meal vs ya know...actually liking what he was eating. - Oh yeah  the food poisoning. Had a great night spewing shit outta both ends of my body. Thanks BJ\'s!"
Dale B.,Shingle Springs  CA,9,58,3,3/15/2015,2.0,Service lousy  ribeye mostly fat. Mashed potatoes stone cold. The server never even came back to see if everything was ok  after forgetting the silverware and my NA beer. This place has truly gone out of fashion. I'm being generous with 2 stars. The local small sushi places knock this out of contention normally. But I was feeling like a decent steak tonight...Fail! I always leave a tip but I can't even do that here tonight.
Dustin P.,Millbrae  CA,0,17,27,5/9/2015,5.0,Krystal the manager and Rob our waiter provided us with excellent service! They treated us extremely well and made our dinner fun and enjoyable! Thank you Krystal and Rob!
Jeremy O.,Mountain View  CA,1,15,,10/3/2015,4.0,I eat here very regularly like probably twice a month. The only reason I do not give five stars is I have had subpar service once but usually the service is great. I love the food here. The Baked Beignet I think its called is great for dessert. They have awesome ribs here. They make great pizza. Drinks are all good. I highly recommend this place and I am actually surprised it does not have better reviews overall. This place is definitely a lot better than the two stars I see a lot of people giving them. Maybe not worth five stars but definitely 3 to 4 stars. Kind of feel when I read people's reviews that have been here multiple times they obviously like the food but get one subpar experience and only do a review then.
Justin B.,San Francisco  CA,117,115,197,8/1/2014,3.0,I have been to this Bjs a few times and had good experiences. The food is always consistent and fresh. They have great lunch specials that hit the spot and are very affordable. Service is pretty good and we usually get seated quickly during lunch. Most of the time we are in and out within 30-45 minutes. Great location too  right off the 380 and 280. Today we ordered the bbq lunch slider special and was delicious. Only $6.95 and came out 10 mins after we ordered it. They also have a great rewards program where they give you free desserts based on points and sometimes discounts.
ramon p.,San Francisco  CA,1,14,2,7/26/2016,4.0,We came here Sat evening and as expected the place was packed. We personally received outstanding service and the place was spotless clean. Pizza  soup in a sour dough bread were pretty tasty. My Jambalaya was a bit too spicy for my taste  but not bad. Salmon was cooked to perfection. TVs for me were great  not a date night for taking ladies. Full bar  very convenient for us coming from San Francisco. Beer and cocktails about normal of what you expect for a big place like this. I felt this place was low priced. I love the atmosphere.
Leina K.,San Francisco  CA,67,388,400,11/19/2013,3.0,ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS BUSY!No matter when you want to go  it's always busy. The best thing to do is to do call ahead seating where they will put you on the waiting list as though you were there. I will usually call an hour ahead and still end up waiting 5-10 minutes.
Lawrence S.,San Francisco  CA,0,15,2,1/24/2016,5.0,Rochelle is fabulous Daniela is equally amazingThanks for your help! Word of advice to management  keep them around.
Venus L.,San Bruno  CA,182,566,1124,6/30/2013,1.0,"After my visit to this BJ\'s  I came home sad and with a tummy ache. I know that experiences at restaurants could be a hit or a miss depending on when you go and who you get as your server. In this case  I guess it was a HUGE miss. First off  we had 7 people in our party so they sat us as one of the booths on the right side. Unfortunately  my dad is a pretty big person so one side sat 3 people and the other side sat 4. It was painful since we were pretty squished even with ""skinny girls"" and another guy. We weren\'t able to put a chair at the end of the table because that\'s considered a fire hazard which we totally understood. But it was just a painful dining experience. Next issue? The pizza. We ordered a large BJ\'s favorite and there was barely any toppings on the pizza which led us to think that we had gotten the wrong pizza. (We didn\'t. Boo.) And the pizza crust seemed WAY thinner than usual. Seriously? It became our least favorite thing on the menu. The rest of the food came out about 15-20 minutes after the pizza. And well  I\'m not sure about the others but my grilled chicken pasta came out cold. Not even slightly warm. Just... cold. And the chicken was dry. Needless to say  I was bummed but choked down the meal with the help of my root beer.And service? Our waiter was not in tune with our needs. And most of the time we had to flag him down. Which was not cool  especially since we saw him ask the tables around us repeatedly if they need anything. We felt ignored. So overall  eh. We agreed that it was gonna take A LOT for us to give this place another chance. I dunno. Maybe it was just a miss this time and next time it\'ll be a hit? We\'ll wait and see."
Alex L.,San Francisco  CA,482,105,12,2/22/2016,1.0,"BJ\'s typically is your average 3 star restaurant... on a good day. Came here with my dad for breakfast  what a mistake that was. It started from the point of ordering. I ordered the California scramble  and my dad ordered another breakfast entree. The kicker is when they asked him how he wanted his eggs done. He replied poached. First  off the waitress did not know what poached eggs were  then she said they didn\'t do that here and it is not on the menu. Fun fact  none of the style of eggs are on the menu  I didn\'t see  ""choose your style of eggs  sunnyside  scrambled  over easy."" Anyway  they ""accommodated"" us  which lead to the manager coming over saying how they had to ""accommodate"" us since poached eggs is not a typical option and for us to not expect it in the future. I had no idea that poached eggs were so difficult. Following the egg debacle  the service continued downhill where they didn\'t refill our drinks when we asked them to. Furthermore  we had asked for a pizza to be prepared to take away at the end of our meal  that was forgotten  extending our horrendous dining by another 20 minutes while they made it. The list goes on and on. They deserve negative 1 star for this experience and management needs to get a handle on their employees."
Tiff C.,San Francisco  CA,1120,1042,1688,4/17/2011,3.0,BJ's is ALWAYS packed.. and I seriously don't get why?? I mean yes it's better than EBAR.. thats for d@mn sure.. but the food is mediocre.. when there are games on like the other day when I went... the place is full of bandwagoners who like to go out and grab a beer or two and ACT like they are watching the game..We had a 30 minute wait which is pretty ridiculous.. and usually I wouldn't wait that long for a place like this but we wanted to be at a place where we could watch the game while grabbing dinner... what IS cool about BJ's is that they come around every so often offering mini slices of pizza to their waiting customers.. that's good CS right there. Ended up getting a seat at the bar area since its first come first serve... service was okay.. kind of slow.. food was okay..
Russ T.,South San Francisco  CA,17,20,,3/21/2015,1.0,Usually  we get good service & good food here at BJ's. Tonight is not one of those night. Tonight  my wife got the pulled pork BBQ sandwich  the thin fries & an ice tea. I got the unlimited soup & salad with a diet Pepsi. My wife's dinner was fine  but had to ask for sugar; no problem. But I asked for the chili & a house salad; the salad wad fine but the chili was a bit too salty & not very good. Then the waiter picked up the dishes & my wife had to remind him I got the unlimited soup & salad. I ordered a broccoli & cheese soup  a caesar salad & a refill on my drink. First came my drink  then the soup but the salad never came. The soup wasn't good either & I had enough bad service. I asked for a box & our check. The waiter knew him blew it & sent another waiter to deliver the check. Just as I paid the check  the salad came. The perfect end to a crappy meal. Get some better help  BJ.
Jonathan W.,Western Addition/NOPA  San Francisco  CA,150,4,7,2/21/2015,3.0,Went there last night. It was busy and a long wait so I hoped in the bar area got a seat pretty fast.The Food. I order shrimp tacos. The are on the shrimp did not have any flavor. There was only 2 tacos and some chips and salsa. Should have had 3 tacos or more chips wasn't full after eatingThe drinks. I had a strawberry mojito pretty good The desert. Mini bouzouki I think that how it's call pretty good ice cream on a warm cookieThe SERVICE. This is why only put 3 stars Our server was attentive at first then disappeared after ordering. My friend order a salad to come first and he had to tell her again. Then the salad shows up a min before the food. Then we finish eating and waited 20 min until we got our check.
Rich L.,South San Francisco  CA,5,24,1,7/4/2014,1.0,"Very disappointed. I\'ve been to a few other BJ\'s locations and they were much better. We had a party of six and one in a highchair. We asked for Gluten Free menus ( which they advertise they have) but were told by the manager that all they had were ""these"" and were handed a nutrition information flyer. She also said that some of the things on the flyer weren\'t available here  but never said which were or were not available. When we did receive our order one entree was wrong (why would you put onion strings on a Burger you acknowledged and referred to as Gluten Free)  one was missing and didn\'t arrive until everyone else had finished and we never got a refill of our drinks. The place was packed and had a wait of about 30 minutes for a table  so they have no real motivation to improve things. Won\'t be going back to this spot...ever!"
Casey T.,Santa Monica  CA,0,3,,6/13/2016,2.0,waited for a solid 10 minutes before they even acknowledged us  very dismissive service and I am not impressed. all I wanted was my Oreo pazookie and I am leaving very sad
Jordan S.,San Francisco  CA,89,41,16,12/8/2014,1.0,One star  only because of their service.I've been to BJ's many times throughout the years  and the food is reasonable  and I like their Pazookies. However  today the service was really bad. It was bad enough for me to finally write a review. My girlfriend and I were very patient with our waiter  Mark  and he completely ignored us throughout our time there. We counted 6 specific times he checked on everyone in our section EXCEPT us. We were planning on eating dessert but the wait was so long  and basically killed our entire mood there. I had to physically get out of our booth in order to pay our check. Huge disappointment.
Peter A.,Pacifica  CA,22,157,15,10/16/2014,1.0,I sat down for a brief lunch here last weekend and it was so cold I had to go back amd get a jacket. I ordered the cheese burger and fries. The burger was small and the fries so greasy I could not eat them.The menu is so big and the place is very loud dont waste your money. Better options are near by but this mall is a schlock fest of lcd everything.
Howard K.,Redwood City  CA,48,15,6,6/12/2016,2.0,The watery Queso Dip showed up cold twice (even after sending it back) - so gross. Bathrooms covered in urine. They did let me order the Chili Burger off menu - they was cool. The kitchen simply could not execute.
Christian B.,Hayward  CA,5,7,12,8/19/2015,3.0,I went here @8/17 around 1ish. I was with my girlfriend. Knowing I had work in an hour 1/2 I tried to squeeze in a quick dish and dessert and see if they would serve pretty fast. We were seated right away and took a quick second to look at the menu. I was able to use the restroom and the server still did not come to our table yet. He took about 10-15 mins. Joseph our waiter had a very soft voice like he didn't want to be there/careless. We ordered a personal pizza with one topping and a salad side and a cookies n creame pizookie. Salad came out pretty fast but the pizza took a little long and our pizookie didn't come out until I had to leave. I just wish our waiter was little more caring about his job. The pizza was delicious but my topping was like only 3 pieces of pepperoni while my girlfriend had a lot of pineapples.
tere p.,Daly City  CA,24,20,35,6/11/2016,1.0,As of 330pm today. We went to bar area lounge  server serve as water then took our order. Wings  grilled cheese  chicken tacos  avocado rolls. After that  he turn to other table to take order. Time passed like 10 min or less. The order infront of us arrived and our server went to the restroom. Time passed by like 12 to 15min and i asked help from a busser/server to assist following up with the food. And the busser said yes. But he went instead to the bar and took the drinks to serve in other tables. One woman server I asked help again. She mentioned table 802 when i pointed where we were seated. And our server I saw coming out from the restroom. I asked him for follow up on the food because my 19 month old baby is hungry. And he said he is also waiting fot the food and turn his back right away. HE SAID THAT WITHOUT EVEN GOING TO THE KITCHEN AREA AND CHECKING OUT. HE SAID THAT THEN and went to THE TABLE infront of us to TAKE ORDER!!. Pissed us off right away. We walked out and talked to the mgr on duty and the mgr is offering us food and I said no more. So here is your YELP REVIEW. No wonder it's 2 stars only.
Kjeld P.,San Francisco  CA,74,8,,9/28/2015,4.0,I'm writing this because this place doesn't deserve a 2.5 stars rating. I think the expectations for it  is high  because the way the place looks  and a bit on the prices you expect maybe a little more. Most complaints have being on the waiting time and on the food not being close to the amount it costs  their prices are on the 10 20s range  the salads could be less  and cost the same amount of the burgers. I always went with a burger and a beer  and left satisfied  if their selection has fewer things they could maybe get a better rating.I never had the waiting be too long  maybe came here on a weekday and lucked out.But again if you compare a 2.5 star place with this you know this is better  and I'm happy to have it as an option as there aren't many places like it around.As for the people running  -less on the menu  make it tastier  fresher-keep the good waiters  they have them  be more efficient on unattended tables.
Christopher X.,Millbrae  CA,53,91,86,9/29/2014,4.0,I'm being nice with this place by giving them 4 stars because I know they can do better. First off  the food was great. They screwed up on some things  though the pizza was fantastic. I ordered the bison burger with fries  and it was delicious! A bit over-cooked  but what do you expect from a place like this? I can tell you that our server was nice  but she left for her break in between without warning  and came back later! This place is also prime vampire territory. I know it's for the ambience  but the restaurant is so poorly lit I might as well guess who I'm talking to. Overall satisfaction for me. Drop in for some good finger food and football.
Dean N.,San Francisco  CA,39,108,95,6/5/2016,2.0,"Walking in I was struck by the lack of character. I was not expecting much  however I had a recommendation and their previous recommendation was not horrible. Then I got my hopes up remembering a great microbrewery in Boston and a couple in NYC. I didn\'t have any beer there  so maybe if I had then my experience would have been different. However their home-brewed soft drinks were undrinkable. I would list those drinks on my ""the worst thing I ever ate"" list  so even if I tried their beer I doubt any changes. appetizer was potato skins  which I almost stopped ordering because they are horrible so many places  these came out looking good  but no sour cream and fake bacon. Glad I was hungry. For entree I had a steak  potato and asparagus. Steak was cooked almost correctly  at least rare and two bites were amazing. If they had talent or skill amazing things could have happened in their kitchen. Baked potato was blah. Asparagus tasted liked they scraped their shrimp sauce off before serving  even served cold. Finally  for a tie breaker I had dessert  and since national donut day was last week I decides to try their beignet. I mean... how can they mess those up. Well they far exceeded their incompetence. The gelato was one of my favorite brands  but hidden under their canned whipped cream and strawberries that were sour  and had a weird oily covering I guess to supply the flavor that was lacking. Two stars for the attempt to cook a steak. At least they achieved a correct internal temperature and two flavorful bites."
C K.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,2,6/19/2016,1.0,"Horrible  service and food. Unfortunately I took my boyfriend here for brunch on father\'s day only because he didn\'t want to wait 45 to an hour for all the GOOD food places we stopped at. Like Jacks across the street. We came to bj\'s and sat in the bar area. We waited 10 mins before someone came to clean the table we wanted to sit at and another 20 before someone took our order. Mind you I had to stop someone in the area and ask who\'s the waiter or waitress. After no one acknowledged our presence. That guy ended up taking our order. They were no where near busy. We ordered from the brunch menu. Bj\'s should not have brunch as a part of their menu! Eggs were rubbery and the cheese I asked to be scrambled into the eggs was almost nonexistent ""Apple wood smoked bacon"" was thin like paper and French toast was blah. Coffee was watery. I\'m not a huge fan of Bj\'s already this just confirmed why."
Ed U.,San Francisco  CA,4142,3790,28673,1/17/2011,3.0,I have to admit that the only reason I've ever come to BJ's is the convenience of its location en route to SFO. There is really nothing distinctive about the menu compared to a Chili's or a Hard Rock Cafe or an Applebee's  and the service is basically the same as those chains as well. What struck me about my visit there was the prominence of the calorie counts under each item  and the fact that they actually influenced my choice. Y'see  I was on my way to the airport to start a 2 1/2-week holiday in Iberia and Morocco fully recognizing that I wasn't going to make nutrition a huge priority when I crossed the pond. In fact  I could have used a calorie count on the bowl of snails I ate at a random food stand in the expansive night market in Marrakesh. BJ's doesn't offer snails  but they make decent Fish Tacos. Panko-crusted and lightly fried fish served in corn tortillas with a chipotle mayonnaise  Santa Fe dressing  and shredded vegetables (see photo). It was satisfying especially with some tortilla chips and a couple of dipping sauces - avocado cream sauce and fire-roasted tomato salsa. I added a side salad for good measure  dressing on the side of course (see photo). It was a perfectly acceptable pitstop on the way to the airport  and the timing was right since the baby brigade started rolling in as we were about to leave. I was particularly impressed with a young mother who tried to feed her two toddlers only to have one boy shrieking like a banshee and forcing her to abandon her plans of a quiet lunch. The snails don't seem so bad now  do they...FOOD - 3 stars...like pretty much any other chain that serves basic brewhouse fare but at least with a calorie tracker AMBIANCE - 3 stars...what you'd expect from a family-style mall eatery SERVICE - 3 stars...I honestly don't remember TOTAL - 3 stars...if you need an inoffensive bite before your flight
Vivian L.,San Francisco  CA,72,127,39,7/22/2014,2.0,Went here for the first time with my family today. We got calamari appetizer  full rack of bbq ribs  salmon dinner  and shrimp scampi pasta. The calamari was great. Very crunchy and decent sized. The bbq ribs were nothing special. Salmon dinner smelled really burnt and was the size of my palm. Shrimp scampi was the most disappointing of all. I looked at it and knew it wasn't going to be good and i was right. It was flavorless. Everything looks better pictured in the menu. The shrimp scampi  ribs  and salmon dinner from elephant bar are 10x better than this place's. Service was ok. Bill came out to be $75 not including tips. Extremely overpriced for the poor quality food. Will not be returning.
R. A. D.,South San Francisco  CA,38,71,107,9/13/2014,2.0,This place is always overly packed in weekends. Which is why I did a call ahead. Called ahead and was quoted for 25 min wait time. Added name and arrived 20 minutes later. Checked in and quoted for another 25 minutes. Call ahead was extremely pointless.Two stars are for the location and the usual food I always order.
Alyssa M.,San Bruno  CA,88,77,26,6/27/2015,1.0,I would like to start off by saying I have only been to the San Bruno and Foster City locations. Foster City: service is slow. Staff is attentive to their designated tables. Good customer service. Sometimes I've had to flag another waiter to get my tables check because our waiter went MIA. Overall descent. San Bruno: service is slow. Staff is not attentive to their designated area. Customer service lacks any sort of quality. The wait is always long because it's a smaller location inside a mall. On my most recent visit  I walked in and saw an empty booth I wanted but was dirty. I stood there for a few minutes and no one came. So we sat at a high top table. There were 3 servers all helping tables around where I was sitting and it started to feel awkward when we weren't being helped. It was out lunch break and we didn't have time to sit and wait for someone to never help us. After 5 minutes a waiter walked over to the table next to me  that sat down after me and he took their order. He walked right by me and wouldn't make any eye contact. If I was sitting at a table where no one was working  one he could have told me he would take care of us or had us move to his section  maybe a table over. But no. Him and 3 other servers kept walking past us. Didn't ask us anything and weren't planning on helping us at all. I walked up to the bar and the bartender just so happened to be extremely apologetic and hospitable. However my order came out wrong and it took forever to fix and by the time I got it and started to eat we had been there for 45 minutes! I do not recommend the San Bruno location at all. I overheard a server say it was going to be a good day for him because he got 20% on his first table. Wow. There were guys that sat down after U.S. But behind us and they got up and left about 15 min of waiting and no one came to help them. As a former server  I felt so angry at the workers for not informing me someone wasn't here yet  they could have helped me! But they didn't and they just lost my business and anyone I ever talk to!
Marion S.,Berkeley  CA,21,8,43,1/21/2015,1.0,"I\'m with a group of nine. We\'ve already had to change our waiter. The service is EXTREMELY SLOW  our first waiter was a caught by the person at the end of our table rolling his eyes and sighing after being asked for something by the person at the opposite end of our table.When the manager was told how we felt like our table has been neglected  he\'s simply said "" let me see what I can do about that"" then simply changed our waiter. No apology  or anything. The second waiter tried to make up for the first one. He did ok  but our table is full of dirty dishes as I type this.Oh  we accidentally knocked over a half full glass off soda  none of the staff offered to help clean it up and didn\'t even offer us a towel. I had to ask for something to clean it up. Then when he (the first waiter) returned  he just dropped a stack of of small square napkins on the table and walked away. If we weren\'t hear celebrating something  and NINE of us  we would have just left..... The manager never even came by the table to check on things after changing our waiter. Smh..Oohhhh  now that were asking for the corporate number the manager comes back out and now offering to comp our bill. We would have taken better service!!"
Aileen C.,Cupertino  CA,242,97,337,2/28/2013,4.0,Great food and great company!!This was my first visit at the BJ's in San Bruno  and I have to say that the food was better than my expectation. I have been to the BJ's in Cupertino a handful of times and each time I went  my expectations were lowered. I came here with a party of eleven (three children) for lunch on a Sunday. When I first came in  I went straight to the hostess to ask for a table; she told me that it would be 30min to 1hr. She never mentioned that we could sit outside  which would be immediate seating  until the rest of the party came in. -______-If you sit outside  it does get a little noisy  as the airplanes land. As a group  we shared various appetizers. We had the buffalo  orange chicken wings and boneless wings  and potato wedges. The potato wedges were BOMB!! very crispy  right amounts of cheese  bacon  and green onion. I think the best thing I ate that afternoon. I also shared the Cajun chicken with my cousin.  When the plate came out  the food was very hot  which I LOVE! I had imagined it to taste some what like jambalaya  but it just tasted like grilled chicken :( I also had a rib  which was DELICIOUS! :)
Jackie M.,South San Francisco  CA,16,77,31,6/14/2014,1.0,"This review is only based on the service we received tonight. I come here at least 3 or 4 times a week and we always have great service especially with Kelly my favorite here but tonight our server was Jeffrey  didn\'t check on us until 20 minutes into eating my food  didn\'t bring us silverware had to ask another server for it. And when I asked for a re fill I over heard him saying ""It\'s not even finished"" to the bevtender. I\'m a server also so I know what good customer service is and him thinking he\'s such a great server makes him an even worse one. Rude and fake service."
Rebekah T.,El Cerrito  CA,4520,1969,9923,1/20/2011,3.0,I had not been to Tanforan in years and since before it was BJ's  but I had to go to Target and needed to pick up some dinner. Deciding between the food court or chain restaurants. :I A place called BJ's Restaurant that serves beer and steaks? That's where I'm going.I ordered a BJ's Harvest Hefeweizen with my 1/2 pound Grilled Sourdough Angus burger with cheese and grilled onions. I asked for medium and the burger came out pretty good. The beer was fantastic  crisp tasting with hints of orange. Went well with my meal.He ordered the Flame Broiled NY Strip Steak with the Gigantic Baked Potato and a small Chicago Style Classic combo pizza. The steak was good  but the pizza tasted exactly like Pizza Hut. It was pretty average and forgettable with a oily crust and I didnt eat more than a couple bites.There were some great points to BJ's and for a chain restaurant they have good beer and decent steaks and burgers.
Kay M.,Santa Barbara  CA,0,11,3,9/18/2015,3.0,I come here often out of convenience and its late hours however  the service is just ok when sitting in the dining area. My boyfriend and I prefer to sit at the bar  the service is better your food comes out faster and you've got drinks in front of you to make it all 100 times better. As much as I would love to give this place 5 stars for being that convenient  awesome  I'm obsessed  I can't. PS DO NOT ORDER THE GOURMET MAC N CHEESE (it was less than half a cup of microwaved hard rotini noodles slopped with bread crumbs and bac) my advice is make your own at home and it will probably come out way better
Christian R.,San Francisco  CA,0,22,36,2/10/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Ever since the manager  Ryan  has taken over this place  customer service and quality of food improved drastically. It is one of my favorite places to hang out with coworkers.
Mimi M.,Redwood City  CA,2,11,,12/24/2014,4.0,I love BJ's! (You can take that absolutely any way you want and you're probably not wrong) I'm a fiend for the Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I can never finish it and always have leftovers for the next day or later that night but I always forget to get the darn Pizookie!!!!!! Some day.... I'm a hard customer  though! (Gosh! So many references!) keep the refills coming and the tips are sure to come!
V W.,Las Vegas  NV,569,601,197,5/14/2014,2.0,I really wanted to give BJ'S at least 3 stars  but unfortunately I can't. Here are the two reasons why I'm giving them 2 stars. I came in last weekend with my husband and I ordered an asian salad off the light menu and they got my order wrong twice. I had request no onions or bell peppers in my salad and both times my salad arrived with those items on it. By the third time I was just starving so I ended up picking out all the items off my salad. In all honesty I would have enjoyed my salad if I hadn't spend so much time picking through it.The other thing that made this visit very memorable in a bad way is that a few hours later my husband began to feel queazy and we figured it was the burger he had. He ordered a bison burger done medium well and it was obviously undercooked and or mishandled. My husband spent the entire night vomiting with other symptoms  which only means 1 thing. Food poisoning!!!I'll say that I've been to other BJ's many times and everything was about a 3 star review  but this visit was probably the absolute worst and most likely I will never come back or recommend this place to anyone.My idea of a positive dining experience includes not getting sick. This place is definitely without a doubt 2 thumbs down and if you come here don't say you weren't warned.
Erika C.,Sunnyvale  CA,133,30,3,5/25/2016,2.0,So lets start out by saying we informed the waiter we were on a time restraint. Our waiter was this young guy by the name of Michael B. So I wanted to get relaxed as I was catching a redeye flight to Miami. First off there were three of us that had ordered alcoholic drinks. Michael felt the need to have me go back out to the car to get my I.D ;however he didn't card my sister or my other buddy. Michael literally didn't put my drink until I returned with my I.D. Okay  maybe he really thought I wasn't 21!!! Hmmmmmm So we put our order in 20 minutes had passed and the waiter had yet to give us utensils or go and check on our order. The manager was soooooo compensating for this young punk's arrogance ass attitude. My sister had waved to get our waiter's attention and he sent another staff to help us out. As a matter of fact all the other staff was very helpful accept our own waiter. So now I'm growing impatient and I ask the waiter if he could see how long b4 our food was ready. He stated that he hadnt had a chance to check on the food. MICHAEL B had checked on every customer 2-3 more than he had on us. The manager again stepped in and apologized and had comped some items due to dumb dumbs lack of customer service. I had asked the manager if she could get our bill because we needed to leave. The manager complied and got the bill for us. As we sat there our waiter again  continues to ignore us as if we weren't sitting there..I go up front to pay the bill and the young lady tells me only my waiter can close out my bill. The staff goes to relay the message as she sees that I'm frustrated and growing impatient. Michael B comes to close out the bill and literally starts walking slow  talking to his co-workers and just taking his sweet time to swipe my card. I had to just be silent; otherwise I would've grabbed him by that punkass ponytail and went Bam Bam on him!!!! I am very gracious and good about compensating and giving waiters tips but this imbecile deserved absolutely nothing but a punch in tha face!!! If I should ever go back to that BJ's I will refuse service if he has to wait on me. It is very sad to have an asshole like that while all the others are working diligently to satisfy the customers! His parents must own the establishment because I do NOT understand why he is still employed there!! MICHAEL B  YOU are exactly the first letter or your last name!!! I'm so glad that I have grown to become a bigger and better person and for that I Cant not DEAL WITH YOU!!!!
Michelle B.,Daly City  CA,3,34,86,11/20/2015,1.0,Friendly staff but horrible ticket times. Not even a sorry your shot is taking 20 minutes. Food is great but not worth the wait. Prices are booboo  too. Go to Elephant Bar in Serremonte. More for your money and time.
Johnny G.,San Francisco  CA,288,214,38,4/21/2014,1.0,"Everytime I come to BJ\'s  it\'s a disappointment. The wait for a table here is outrageous.Honestly  if you want a place to kick it with friends over beer and food  BJ\'s would be the ideal place right? This place looks great based on their menu but their service is SLOW and the wait here is stupid LONG. My friend got here at 7PM on a Thursday night to grab a table for 7. Keep in mind that it\'s Thursday night and the tables weren\'t even filled. I arrived at 7:45 PM  45 minutes after my friend already put his name down for a table. As soon as I arrive  I asked the lady in the front how much longer and she said 15 mins. So I sit back down and wait patiently. 20 minutes later  I ask her again and she tells me another 15-20 mins. Ok...you said that 20 minutes ago and we already waited a little over an hour. How about you give us an accurate time? 20 minutes later  I ask her AGAIN and she tells me they\'re ""setting"" up the table. Long story longer  we waited damn near 2 hours for a table here. My friend got here at 7PM and we didn\'t even get seated til damn near 9PM. Funny thing is they decide to open up the back tables after WE were seated. They had a bunch of OPEN seats in the back.There are definitely BETTER places to go for dinner/beer with your buddies. THUMBS DOWN for BJ\'s."
Alize R.,Sunnyvale  CA,99,114,37,9/7/2014,4.0,Food was good. The pazookie is delicious! Tv's everywhere so you don't miss a game. Service was lacking. I think we had 3 different servers. I liked the first one the best.
Marcus F.,Daly City  CA,307,4,17,11/4/2015,3.0,I usually like the food here but today it was just ok. First of all they took one of my favs off the menu the shrimp scampi. Second  I ordered the deep dish ziti and it looked like a flat bread pizza in a deep dish container. It was tasty but not nearly what I expected or what it looked like on the menu. Lastly and what topped it off  my sister ordered a portobello and asparagus salad  instead of getting portobellos she got white mushrooms and didn't bother telling her! Luckily we all noticed and they did get the right mushrooms but gave a lame ass excuse for not putting the right mushrooms on in the first place. It wasn't a total loss though. We got $50 off from the rewards points and the baked beignet was pretty good
Tajanee D.,San Francisco  CA,0,10,6,11/16/2015,1.0,Came to BJS last night for dinner with my baby and friend. I will first begin by staying I have been to BJS on multiple occasions. But this experience was by far the worse. I always get the same thing: Shrimp and Fettuccine Alfredo  but this time it was different. The Alfredo sauce was not creamy at all  it was very very watery. Usually that have a while grilled chicken breast slices on the side but this time it was chicken chunks in it that tasted like something out of a frozen TV dinner. I had to wait 15 minute for a waiter to even come say Welcome to BJS would you like a drink ? Then an additional 10 minutes for some type of silverware. Every Time the waiter came he left before I could finish what I was saying  sometimes in the middle of it. We waited forever for a salad  forever for our dinner  for ever for water  forever for him to get dirty dishes. The service was horrible. I have them 1 star because the garlic knots  my friends steak dinner & our desserts were delicious (minus the they were too heavy with the salt on the Salted Caramel Pizzooke. It was super crowded as always but since we called ahead we were seated promptly but that wouldn't matter based on how slow the service was. DIM after he gave us our bills he apologized for the service because he was working two sections? Too late for that buddy. I'll probably come back if I'm desperate but no more pasta ... AT ALL.
Van N.,San Leandro  CA,0,379,480,11/4/2014,3.0,Drinks are not strong. Not as strong as if you go to local smaller places.AMF sure was blue [correct] but tasted like juice  so no.Margarita might be a better choice.Ordered nachos in the apetizers. SO small. and they werent nachos. they were fritos. literally.The pizza is great. Shareable.Ton of parking.
Jenn T.,San Francisco  CA,85,96,32,10/8/2014,1.0,Worst service ever. No one ever came by to take our order  some waitress dropped off TWO glasses of water for our table of 5 and just walked away to help a table that was sat AFTER ours! Didn't say I'll be with you in a minute or anything. Just dropped off 2 glasses of water and walked off. (This was after 10 minute wait already). We waited another 5 mins another waitress took an order of the table next to ours (which just sat down). We left. I always have really bad food here (nasty mushy burgers) and just God awful service. Trust me your job is not that hard. Figure it out. Never coming back again. Gave it a few tries. Not worth my time or money
Maybo L.,San Francisco  CA,324,159,208,6/9/2014,3.0,I guess I should expect a 45 min wait from a restaurant inside the mall  but at least there's a Barnes and Noble right across where you can look around and check out some new books for a bit until your table is ready. Even ended up finding a book I wanted to read and I usually don't have time to read! I ordered a medium rare steak and when it came it seemed as if it was more like medium well. I barely saw any red parts. This was probably due to the chef overcooking it since the waiter knew I ordered a medium rare when I told her it was overcooked and tough. My friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was really good but it had a whopping 1790 calories! One sandwich is almost a whole day's meal worth of calories! Crazy! It didn't seem that fattening though! Service is bad  I got two knives on my steak order with NO forks... I don't think anyone eats steak with their hands. It's not ribs. It was hard to flag down my waiter to ask for a fork  just a bit frustrating when you have waited so long for a table and food and just want to finally eat! Even though the food is mediocre and service doesn't seem to exist  I always end up coming back for their pizookies! Its just so good!
Mr.biggalsworth D.,Daly City  CA,85,12,1,10/14/2015,3.0,A bjs. Better staff than most. During lunch it can be a hit or miss in terms of speed of service. Recommend only coming for happy hour and for sports games. ALSO! shots are overpriced  mixed drinks aren't so bad. Definitely  you are better off just getting beers $4 dollar happy hour $6 dollars regular price. Their seasonal beers are usually really good so please don't forget to ask  you may miss out on something great.
Christan G.,Daly City  CA,7,5,1,8/4/2015,1.0,The food is decent  most of the time. But good takes long. Service is the shittiest I've ever had. It's always packed. And the food is way overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Jack's
Jason C.,Manhattan  NY,309,477,352,12/9/2012,2.0,Gone downhill over the years.Buffalo wings were just chicken tenders with some sauce poorly tossed in. I can still see the breading.Pizza was poorly made. Toppings were all just on one side of the pizza. The pizza was hardly even cut. Pizza no longer served in pan.Took 10 mins for server to refill drinkPizookie was still good.
Judy P.,Moraga  CA,1,13,1,6/5/2016,1.0,"This is the worst BJ\'s ever! It is hard to mess one up  but they mastered it. Horrible service  45 min. to just get my dish  Mahi and shrimp  but my husband\'s ahi salad  had not arrived yet. How long can it take to make a cold Ahi dinner? The Mahi was Luke warm when it arrived  inedible . The garlic knot was hard as a rock. Called the manager. She said she would get me something else... Let me remind you the ahi salad... Still not arrived. So I ordered the kale brussel sprout salad  which she said would be ""super speedy"". 15 min later both showed up. Unfortunately you could not eat the brussel sprouts because they were not cooked fully. I guess that would have taken another 15 min. No wait  it\'s a cold salad and they should have been ready ! Good news is the ahi salad was edible . They also charged us for everything which if they were smart they might have at least in good faith have given me the salad. Oh and the bill it took 15 min after asking the waiter for the bill for it to arrive. Never will we return!"
Petunia L.,Pacifica  CA,658,499,298,3/28/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Super bad experience  ordered a burger & it was horrible  complained to the manager(Tracy) who promised to rectify the situation & nothing... We were promised a new meal etc & we never received anything....we didn't eat our meal and waited anticipating our new meal and after 30 minutes got impatient and left....Horrible!!!!
Margarita M.,San Francisco  CA,26,40,12,6/12/2014,1.0,"Should I even put a star? If there was an option for no-star  that\'s totally what I would put.Here\'s the reference number for the receipt: 0612010000452Feel free to contact me for more details. I hope you all don\'t just ignore your customers on social media.First  let me start off by saying I totally understand that today is a busy day. Game 4 Spurs vs Miami  you know everyone is at BJ\'s trying to catch the game. We ordered food for pickup and our friends went ahead and picked it up for everyone in the house.This is what we ordered:1. Bison Burger2. Shrimp Scampi Pasta3. Cajun Pasta4. Shrimp TacosOnce there  my friends were told that the order will be ready in less than 10 minutes. An hour later  they were still waiting for the Shrimp Tacos. They left before the game started and came back after half-time (imagine that-- 10 minutes my ass.)Secondly  when the food arrived  we found out that the Scampi Pasta wasn\'t even there. We got Alfredo Fettucine instead. SERIOUSLY?! It was already an hour long and then you couldn\'t even get the order right?!Then when we tried to call Mr. William Morthole  the Senior Manager (he provided his card and told us that he will take care of us next time--thanks for the gesture) and he was busy on the phone and couldn\'t call us back. We called again to get assistance from a different manager and the ""best"" she could do was price adjust the meal. I\'m sorry. That\'s not the best you could do. I ordered a Shrimp Scampi and got forced to eat a bland fettuccine alfredo. What if I had been a pescatarian  would you have told me that the best you could do was price adjust my meal that I couldn\'t even eat? Should I even be paying for a meal I did NOT want? NO. This meal should\'ve been given to me for free. And as I just got off work and was ready to eat dinner  I ate it. I sucked it up and ate a meal i did not want. This is what I think BJ\'s should\'ve done:1. Don\'t tell us that the meal is ready in ten minutes when its not. Say it will be ready in an hour if its going to be ready for an hour.2. Don\'t offer your card and contact number if you have no interest on following up.3. Don\'t let your customer pay for food they didn\'t order -- clearly this is a fuck up on your end--this means it should be on the house.Oh  this incident literally happened just about an hour or two ago. Wound is still very fresh."
Kimberly T.,Valencia  CA,10,43,71,9/10/2014,5.0,Jalapeno burger is amazing. Chicken post stickers were delicious and the pink lemonate is just the best.
carmela s.,San Francisco  CA,5,41,16,7/12/2015,1.0,The wait list here is a joke! We called ahead and were told we would be the first to be seated upon arrive. 30 min later and 50 people later we were still waiting! You need a new manager who knows how to run a restaurant. You should also invest in training your staff  especially the front staff.
Katie P.,San Francisco  CA,565,439,235,11/21/2012,1.0,You get what you'd expect at BJ's. If you're stuck in San Bruno  this is unfortunately one of the only places to grab food & beer. I think they hire people without any waiting experience  which would explain why their waitstaff is aloof and confused.The host ignored us. The table we were seated at had food and what appeared to be love stains all over the seats. I had to ask for cloth napkins to lay down because it was slightly terrifying. Our waitress was completely absent. Not once  but TWICE we placed drink orders from the General Manager (who was great  actually) because she was no where to be found. Everything is really overpriced for the quality of the food (which is poor). I don't even know why I'm writing this review. Duh  BJ's sucks. Hop on Bart and grab something fresh & local in SF if ya can.
Alexis I.,Inner Sunset  San Francisco  CA,174,11,2,10/26/2015,2.0,Dirty plates. Dirty utensils. Dirty table. Smh. Had to ask 4 different workers for new plates and utensils. Asked 3 different workers to wipe down our table. The food was okay though.
Maurie M.,San Francisco  CA,125,40,,4/14/2015,2.0,My best friend and I came in to have dinner. Our server was a friendly young woman. She took our order we both order 2 types of wings  salad and fries. Our wings arrive and we both took a bite only to eat ice cold meat . I told the young lady about our food she took it back but my mood did change . when our wings arrived it just felt like they warmed it in the.microwave. I wasn't going to say anything again just ate a little more then asked for a Togo box. Dessert was delicious. I have had better food I don't think I will be back again. The 2 stars are for the young woman who served us.
Stephanie L.,San Francisco  CA,227,46,47,5/18/2015,5.0,"A huge THANKS to our server Steven C.!!! 8pm 5/18/15 ^_^!!! We really appreciated the great service and such politeness! ""My pleasure"" he always said and with a smile. Great attitude! The food! Oh gosh! It was delicious! I has a chicken Cesar salad  my husband had a Jambalaya and my mother-in-law had the ribs! Delicious! After that we had Beignet with chocolate chip ice cream as a replacement for the vanilla ice cream(they ran out) but it was just perfect! I would say it\'s better ^_^! We also had 2 tequila sunrises and an adios! Strong ^_~! Thank you! Great way to start the week ^_^!"
Robbin P.,Pacifica  CA,0,5,,5/10/2016,2.0,The brussel sprouts are hard as a rock . Wait staff and cooks do not communicate at all.
Crystal C.,San Francisco  CA,563,454,87,4/4/2014,2.0,I have such mixed feelings for BJ's that I had to give it only two stars. While they do offer a nice location (right at the end of the mall) and plenty of booths  TVs  indoor/outdoor seating  I just never get a good vibe or hot food when I dine there.The servers are always nice  but regularly switch shifts in the middle of our meal. I don't need to get to know you  or your co-worker  this isn't fine dining. But ok  they are friendly  espcially when I've gone in with my BFF and her baby  everyone dotes on her  offers baby-appropriate snacks  etc. but the hosts/hotesses could use an attitidue adjustment. Um  I'm sorry  am I inconveniencing you by asking to be seated while you're working? Is that not your job? Have you ever heard of smiling/greeting customers?We have ordered the Flatbread Pizzas  but they have never really been hot and the flavors are just kind of... bleh. I had the clam chowder followed by a Pazzuci (sp?) that I shared with two friends which gave me an awful feeling and caused me to be sick when I got home. I have also tried the Halibut fish tacos and they were bland.I think it really depends on what you order. When BFF got the baby a chicken tenders with fries meal  baby mushed up the fries  we ate the tenders which were really hot and yummy  but that's such a basic item that anyone could get right. I will say that I like their Cider/Heff beer cocktail. Overall  there are plenty of other places to eat  like the food court or 5 Guys which appeal to me much more.
Angelique B.,San Bernardino  CA,36,105,44,10/13/2014,5.0,Wonderful food and great drinks. Joshua was very poliTe and very attentive.Great lunch items to choose from.  Would highly recommend and will be looking forward to coming back.

RW M.,Yuba City  CA,0,30,15,5/25/2016,4.0,Came here twice today this evening was a great experience. Excellent drinks. The strawberry margaritas were very good. Our server  Nick was awesome. He was very attentive and on top of everything. A great night overall.
Scarlet R.,Daly City  CA,52,24,6,10/13/2014,2.0,"Just finished having a late dinner with my boyfriend for happy hour. Everything was fine except the fact that the food runner was pretty disrespectful. We ordered three appetizers and he approached our table rudely asking with two more plates  ""you ordered more food?!"" He said it in a surprising tone  and that was the only thing he said to us. We were just missing our mini pizza dish  but what if we did order more food? That\'s not the way to approach a table. He didn\'t even say hi. On top of that when we were leaving  the same food runner hogged up the whole aisle as we were passing by each other and didn\'t even give me room or said excuse me. I don\'t usually yelp bad reviews  but I was really unhappy with the way he handled things. Hopefully nobody else has to experience it  but other than that everything was just alright. Our server was nice and sweet  but the pizza came out pretty cold. There will be better days!"
Kelly Y.,San Mateo  CA,71,242,315,10/14/2012,4.0,"Food: I had the honey crisp chicken salad. It was good. There were a lot of ingredients.  We had a personal pizza as well. They were all ""ok"" - because we tried to get lower calorie foods. There are a ton of things on the menu. I love it when restaurants show the number of calories. The calamari is more than 900 calories!! It\'s a classic American restaurant - lots of high calorie food  but I\'m sure it\'s awesome! Next time I\'ll get some of the higher calorie foods. Service: They were super busy  even though we went on a weeknight and already 8pm or so. We had to wait 30 minutes. Our waitress was fine  no complaints.Ambience: Nice decor  see-through garage doors  lots of wall mirrors for some reason  sports on the numerous TV screens. Cozy booths."
William A.,Juneau  AK,7,32,1,10/21/2015,2.0,The service was slow and very generic. It took 15 minutes to get water served after we sat down. The wait staff who served us were pretty mechanical and not very engaging. This is the 2nd time I've tried their beer and it was flat and warm again. The atmosphere is decent but I can't say the experience either time was enjoyable. I'll be steering clear of this brand from here on out 
Jessica C.,San Francisco  CA,22,108,12,9/17/2014,5.0,I do not know where else I can get good food and delicious drinks near my house! When my friends and I come we usually get some apps (i've tried potatoe skins  avocado roll things  calamari and mozarella sticks and they were all good). My favorite thing to get though is the great white pizza. Ohh that garlicy goodness.... As for drinks though I've only actually enjoyed the strawberry splash  strawberry patch and strawberry mojitos (if you cannot tell by now I really like strawberries). In my opinion there is not a strong alcohol taste which is perfect for me. Sometimes the wait can be a bit lengthy. I came here on friday around 7 and the wait was about a little over an hour. Not bad though.
Olga B.,San Bruno  CA,317,249,893,12/27/2012,5.0,Incredibly delicious food here!Came to celebrate our friends present to his bride - two brilliant rings. Ordered steaks  beer  salads. Spent approximately 80 $ for 3 people. Steaks were done perfectly  with mushed potatoes  mmm  and German beer :)
Darrell N.,Ingleside  San Francisco  CA,174,33,7,4/30/2014,4.0,Lots of good items on the menu! Lots of TVs if you ever want to go to watch the game. (Very little seating at the bar though)I recently came here to order takeout. The waitress was nice enough to stop assisting her tables and took my order  while she was at the register. Took about 20 minutes to get my food though...you need to make sure to tell them your name at the desk and remind them because they forgot to call out my name when the food came. I waited an extra 10 minutes when the food was there the whole time...I guess everybody was busy because the restaurant was packed that night due to the NBA playoffs.Overall  BJs would def be an option for me whenever I am craving pasta! I ordered the Grilled chicken pasta and it was just perfect!
Rodney H.,San Francisco  CA,4854,1169,3876,12/19/2010,4.0,"Ever since TGI Friday\'s closed down  there hasn\'t really be a go to sports bar spot where everyone can meet up  so BJ\'s at Tanforan has been a welcome sight. I\'ve been here quite a few times since it opened. I love how they have a massive menu so you can go many different routes depending on your mood. You can have Pizza  Steak  Salads  Burgers  and even Small Bites.I\'ve had my fair share of food from here:Very first thing I ordered here was their Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizza. I ordered a Medium  but that sucker was huge! But if you know me  I usually stay committed to finishing my food and killed it. It was pretty good  but it won\'t be for a while if I choose to order it again considering their robust menu.Next time I visited I tried their Jambalaya  with blackened chicken  shrimp  chicken-andouille sausage bell peppers  onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce all over a bed of rice. While I remember liking it initially  I totally remember it spiciness kicking my ass! I have also had their Santa Fe Salad  romaine lettuce  red onions and fire-roasted red peppers tossed with the house Santa Fe dressing and topped with jack and cheddar cheeses  sliced avocado  corn  diced tomatoes  crisp tortilla strips and blackened chicken breast. Definitely not the healthiest of salads  but it was very satisfying!Then I\'ve had Derek\'s Meatloaf Open Faced Sandwich (yelp.com/user_local_phot). It\'s another crazy dinner that was really tasty  but will be hard to order again because of the menu as well.And on my most recent visit there  I went a little crazy and ordered their Angus Sliders and Mac & Cheese Small Bite. It\'s really hard to not like Sliders  but they were really good and they come in fours instead of the usually two or three (yelp.com/user_local_phot). And then Mac & Cheese ""Small Bite"" was incredible! Rotelle pasta with three cheeses  chipotle  and garlic topped with breadcrumbs and bacon (yelp.com/user_local_phot). That was so good  that I put some of them into my Sliders and made Mac & Cheese Sliders!!! OMG  YUM!!!!So call me a fan of BJ\'s since it\'s a great spot for gatherings and watching sports and great bar food."
Sonya S.,New Orleans  LA,30,147,91,12/5/2012,1.0,In fairness  the Beer should get 5 stars  but the food here was so bad  that this place deserves 1 star and they should be ashamed! I have eaten at Bj's in Orlando and Las Vegas and both times had really good food and beer  so we were both shocked that the food here was worse than Mc Donalds- and I HATE fast food! First  my partner ordered the Turkey Burger which came with fries. The fries came out stone cold. When we finally tracked someone down we told them and they eventually brought some more fries  which were also stone cold!! They were obviously from the same batch and had been sitting for some time. Really? Did they not think to check the temp as the issue was the fact that they were inedible cold  not that we wanted piles of fries! Burger was also tasteless  though the roll looked good.I had a Tomato and Mozzarella salad and a thin crust pizza. Pizza actually tasted remarkably like a Tonitos that you buy in the grocery store for .99  but I was paying $10.50. It was obviously frozen and I only ate 2 of the 6 pieces because it was gag worthy. Considering that on occasion I eat Little Cesears $5 Pizza Pizza  my standards are reasonable. After living in Florida for the past 5 1/2 years  I'm used to blah pizza  believe me! the fact that this was actually inedible really says something. The little salad was OK  though they put overwhelming seasonings on it which kind of ruined it. Just a drizzle of Olive Oil would have been fantastic.I was so annoyed about the food  I refused to get a 2nd beer because they do not deserve any more of my hard earned money! It's a shame because the Red Beer is really tasty.Also the service was horrible. trying to get the attention of a waiter was impossible. My partner joked about tossing his empty beer glass on the floor as they walked by to try and get the attention of someone-anyone! Ugh! Skip this place people  unless you just want beer. The food quality is really  really depressing! We stopped at the Wendy's on the way back to the room as neither of us ate much of our dinners and we were still hungry!
Isaac H.,San Francisco  CA,42,520,455,10/12/2014,4.0,This is a good restaurant to go to at the Shops at Tanfroan mall. I came here with my mom and her girlfriend. I ordered the lemon chicken. When it camp to my table. They for got the bell peppers and the red onions. I had to tell my waiter that they forgot. She went back to the kitchen and go the red pins and the bell peppers. For dessert ordered the brownie and chocolate ice cream. It did not come to my table the first time. So my waiter had to go back to the kitchen and get my dessert. I loved the BJ's root beer. I would come back here when I am in the area.
Melissa C.,Pacifica  CA,56,11,4,9/20/2014,1.0,"The last time I came here I had the worst experience of waiting over 30 minutes to order  over an hour for two drinks and one appetizer  and another 30 minutes for my check.I only came back because after the horrid experience and complaining to the manager  they comped our $20 bill.For a Friday night  it was not busy at all  yet it still took more than 15 minutes to be acknowledged in the bar area and only AFTER our friend went up to a server to ask for menus/service because another table who came after us (that wasn\'t even fully seated yet) was being helped first.From our previous experience  we wanted to order our drinks ASAP for we feared we wouldn\'t get to order at all  we got the drinks in an orderly time  but had to wait to order any food.About three wrong orders of Hennessy&Apple Juice  a pizookie  and waters(with four full waters sitting on our table)  our server saying they\'re still ""cooking"" our chips  her handing us plates for chips  and no extra napkins and 35 minutes later  we receive our correct order of CHIPS AND FRICKEN DIP.Literally  the only reason why this place gets a star at all is for one  yelp doesn\'t allow less that one star and two  the dip was kinda good. Service can really make or break an experience and its terrible that I\'ve had nothing but horrible service in this establishment."
Andy C.,Concord  CA,0,4,,5/13/2016,5.0,Food was excellent. Drinks were tasty. Brittany gave us excellent customer service and made sure we were taken care of.
Helena J.,San Mateo  CA,0,18,17,10/9/2015,5.0,LISTEN PEOPLE. LISTEN UP. If you want to relive your childhood dreams of Pizza Hut in its glory days  this is the establishment for you! But with beer. Delicious  glorious beer. BJs (and just try to type that without laughing) is incredible. The beer is cold and refreshing. The pizza is served on a spaceship. And the bartenders are top notch. What are you doing with your life?! What. Go to BJs. You won't regret it. *high fiving a million angels*
Heather K.,Half Moon Bay  CA,1466,900,1560,3/22/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,These guys have really stepped up their game recently! I used to dislike coming here for dinner cuz the food was just kind of blah. But my hubby and I came in while waiting for our car to be serviced this weekend and I was really surprised at the new menu. Tons of new dishes have been added AND....they now offer beers other than their own! Yeah  Hoegaarden!!!! I had a seared ahi salad that was delicious. We also had the stuffed mushroom snack....tiny but very tasty. Our server was Miguel  who was very nice and attentive.Bummers: the wait can be very long here and the noise level can reach redonkulous levels. But I'm actually quite looking forward to coming back :D
Samantha A.,San Mateo  CA,0,4,1,11/8/2015,2.0,I went here a few weeks ago with my friend. I rated this 2 stars because the service wasn't great. They were slow at getting our food and check. They brought my friend the wrong drink also  and our server was no where around. Needless to say we had about three different servers. On the bright side the food was pretty good
P. C.,San Francisco  CA,10,52,3,4/27/2014,2.0,If I was rating the food  it would get 5 stars!!I continuously come back here to see if their service would change for the better but sadly it's still the same. I even decided to come at a not so busy time too. The hostesses care more about talking about their personal lives and other co workers than they do their customers. That is not ok with me. Being seated towards the middle area  I notice it's always a social gathering spot for the waiters/waitresses to hang out and make fun of customers. I CAN HEAR YOU!!! I really hope management steps up and properly trains their staff more! Your food is so good!!!! Get the staff to match it!!!
Teri C.,San Bruno  CA,130,10,5,11/6/2015,5.0,We were part of a large group tonight with about 20 people  including 3 children. I was impressed with our server  her name is Eva. She did everything that she could to accommodate our large party. Some of us arrived late and she rushed our additional food orders. I will definitely return to BJ's! ! The service was great tonight! I asked to speak with the Manager so that I could provide this feedback and he arrived at our table within a minute and asked if we needed anything. Great service and great food! ! Kudos to our awesome server --- thanks Eva for awesome customer service !!
Michelle A.,Pacifica  CA,0,15,4,11/6/2015,2.0,Sad. Waited for our drink order. Husband likes IPA. Server comes back and says they are out so H orders a different one. Server comes back  now they are out of all tap IPAs. Really!?! On Friday night? H gets a bottled beer. He asks for a glass. When it comes the outside is dirty. We then order food and a salad. Wait wait wait. Salad finally comes  then we get our food 2 minutes later. The bill comes promptly of course. On our way out we see the happy hour sign. Beers should have been $1 off each one. But it just wasn't worth the hassle. First and LAST time there. Stay away from this awful service. The food was fine but extremely overpriced.
Love Food And Wine W.,San Mateo  CA,7,60,18,4/25/2015,1.0,Very slow service here like the one in San Mateo. Thought maybe the San Bruno location would attend customers faster and boy was I wrong!Waitress took too long to take our order and we waited a long time to get our order. The mini pizza lunch was okay not good or delicious like I expected. Honestly  the Pizza Hut personal pizza from Target does taste better. Umm  you're a sit down restaurant and should serve a delicious gourmet pizza. What happened BJ's with your food quality  taste and temperature of food? It is definitely off on all levels including service and dirty utensils. Definitely this restaurant is in need of major improvement in all departments!
Vinnie P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,,10/18/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Still crapy service and terrible customer treatment. Walked in today at 4:50pm and stood right in front of the Spanish guy working at the hosting station and for 2 or 3 minutes and never even acknowledged me. Thought I'd try them again since the last review and never even made it to the table this time. I will never ever go back to BJ's in San Bruno again as long as I live and will inform everyone I know!
Bree B.,Ventura  CA,9,26,2,5/3/2015,1.0,Waited at least 10 min for the server to acknowledge us. Then had to ask for silverware  napkins  plates. Asked two times for extra sauce. They got my entree wrong. Didn't deliver my fiances  when they finally did  it was wrong too and undercooked. Terrible Terrible terrible service. Steer clear of this place. You'll regret it if you don't.
Michelle L.,South San Francisco  CA,22,31,70,8/19/2013,4.0,Great for a hungry party of three. But hey  it's BJs  so you'll be bound to find a clone someplace else. We came here for lunch at 1pm on a Saturday  and it was still fairly packed. The service wasn't bad either  as our waitress was attentive and quick to refill drinks. TV screens are available in every corner you look.The appetizers were the best part of the meal.
Julie M.,Daly City  CA,0,2,,11/16/2014,1.0,I've always come here to be greeted by friendly hostesses and waiters. Last night  I was truly disappointed. Not only could our waiter speak proper English but he was TERRIBLY slow. It took about 40 minutes to receive our food and it took about 10 minutes for us to devour our food from our longing hunger. To make things even better  I came home to a wonderful sitting of diarrhea and woke up at 4am to spew my guts out to my toilet. Thanks for your wonderful FOOD POISONING.
Gage S.,San Francisco  CA,6,32,21,10/16/2014,4.0,Food is always fantastic and seems like a clean place. I like the deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. Their pastas and burgers are great as well. But the BACON AOLIE CORN FRITTERS are like $3 and they are the best appetizer ive ever had. Stuffed mushrooms are great too. So now the service is spotty and ranges from amazing (like when Jennifer B worked there) to not soo good from others. And the wait kind of sucks because its usually busy especially the weekends. But the atmosphere and food are worth it as long as you get seated. And please please please if anyone knows where Jennifer B works now it would be greatly appreciated  please message me or give me her number  she told me but i forgot where she was going  my gf and i loved her service.
Stephanie M.,Kapolei  HI,137,62,242,7/15/2014,4.0,I have been here a couple times. The service is pretty good. There are a couple workers who could improve their attitude a bit but I'm sure it will improve over time. The food did take a while to come out  and some dishes are a hit or miss. Their pasta dishes  calzone& pizzas are really good. But I would probably spice up their artichoke dip and Santa Fe egg rolls. Them make their own root beer &cream soda; both of which are sooo yummy. And free refills. (Win!) Their drinks are also really good. Their strawberry &wild berry mojitos are very good. They have a good selection of beers including ones that are brewed by them. And you can't leave BJ's without having a pizookie. The best invention. We got the salted caramel pizookie &it was sinfully good. It was a caramel cookie with toffee bits topped with vanilla bean ice cream  caramel drizzled over and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square for the final touch. Heaven in my mouth!
Chanel E.,Palo Alto  CA,45,20,3,10/12/2014,2.0,"Absolutely disappointed!!! 45 minute wait due to heavy crowd watching Giants Post Season Game  OKAY understandable. Hot Spin/Dip was cold and served with a bunch of broken bottom of the bag chipsThe GF ordered a Chicken Cobb Salad  FIRST bite she bit included a 1 inch piece of plastic! Manager came to ""check it out"" she took the piece of plastic and salad and brought a ""fresh"" one out which had no chicken! I order bread bowl clam chowder and wedge salad combo. The bowl was actually 1/4 cup of warm soup in a huge bread bowl. The wedge had NO dressing. The staff was flustered trying to keep up with demand of the dine in guest. Understandable but the quality of food shouldn\'t change due to high demand. 2 stars are for the kids meals and tvs. Kids enjoyed food it looked fresh. I\'m disappointed I couldn\'t say the same about the adults food."
Elan K.,Oakland  CA,110,12,1,11/9/2014,2.0,The good? The bathroom was clean. We got seated quickly. The bad? Everything else. Bland Bloody Mary  my breakfast pizza had a piece of blue plastic in it  the bacon was all limp fat with almost no meat on it  2 of our 3 orders were delivered incorrectly - despite being ordered directly off the menu with no substitutions  we never got a side we ordered but they still tried to charge for it...Yuck yuck yuck.
Jim P.,Mountain View  CA,372,434,142,1/4/2015,3.0,Good food  great drinks  tons of TV's for sports. Since this place is in a mall it can get slammed with people sometimes  making the service sometimes slow and the noise level over the top. Best bet is to get into the bar section for faster service on drinks! When it's quiet this place is great  but when there's a ton of families it's horrible!
Lauren K.,San Francisco  CA,369,542,2079,12/20/2010,4.0,This is one of the favorite restaurants among my friends and family. There's usually a wait so what I usually do is call in ahead of time and put my name down since they don't take reservations. I've eaten here during lunch before where they give you food while you wait (I've gotten pizza slices before!).This BJ's is at such a great location and even though there's a long wait at times  I just grab the pager I'm given and go shopping! Today  with 9 of us for my friend's birthday  we were told the wait would be 1 1/2 hours (on a Sunday night). It took a littles less than that and after checking in a couple of times  we were seated.I ordered the Chicken Pesto Flatbread and that was enough to fill me up. My friends had the potato skin appetizers and they said that filled them up so much that they could barely finish their entree!Service was great as usual. The waiter was friendly and we instantly connected. He even cracked some jokes and was really patient with us even though we were a bit loud and indecisive at times. Food came out fast and no one had complaints. I loved what I ordered even though usually I order Cobb Salad  Turkey Avocado Sandwich  or one of their deep dish (Buffalo Chicken) pizzas. I love coming here on birthdays because they give out complimentary mini Chocolate Chip Pazookies with a candle.Prices are decent. It's not cheap but it's pretty worth it for the portion size. I guess price is normal compared to they're competitors: Chilis  TGI Fridays  etc.I always come here like everyone else: for a good movie and delicious dinner!
Sarah B.,Chicago  IL,231,239,94,7/5/2014,2.0,I had a late lunch here the other day  and the service was subpar. The hostess was nice and greeted us immediately  and she let us know it was happy hour in the bar area. We wanted to sit at a booth  so we said we would wait for the booth in the bar area to be cleaned. The waiter tried to tell us to sit elsewhere  and we said we didn't mind waiting for the table to be cleaned off. No one came to clean the table for a couple of minutes. Once the table was cleaned off  it was neve wiped dry. Our server handed us two menus  didn't bring us silverware  didn't introduce himself  and took our drink order. Our drinks came out promptly  and we placed our order. Our server never brought us or informed us of the happy hour menu. Our food was okay  it came out promptly and was accurate. We had another guy come refill our water  but my glass was left empty for quite some time. Neither of the guys were friendly  at all. Maybe they were having a bad day or maybe the hospitality business isn't for them.
Regina D.,Los Angeles  CA,113,9,,4/19/2014,2.0,I have never been very impressed by this location but my visit last night was the cherry on the top. To start off  our waitress smelled like she had just been chain smoking right before she came to our table. The bathroom smelled like there was some sort of sewer leakage and the garbage was over flowing. Every single stall was dirty/out of toilet paper. I used the only clean stall but I had to go find my own toilet paper to bring in with me. The bathroom looked like no one had cleaned it at all the entire day. We ordered the potato skins which were actually very good (and the only reason that I'm giving the restaurant 2 stars)The pazookie was over cookedOverall it was not a pleasant experience and from now on I'll just be going to the BJ's at Bridgepoint
Kao S.,San Mateo  CA,477,236,1176,1/29/2013,3.0,I like this place. I used to come here after work for HH. Great beer and snacks but the parking kinda sucks.. Otherwise great place to mingle and have dinner.
jack d.,San Francisco  CA,5000,325,,12/5/2014,4.0,Took my son to BJ''s Brewery for his birthday and was pleasantly surprised with the very good food and good service Everyone enjoyed their meals as well as the Pizooki that we had afterwards.I tried their local ale which was OK being a brewery and all. The server  Jeremy was very good and efficient The only drawback is the wait for about 50 minutes but it was worth it.
Norm D.,San Francisco  CA,54,130,415,9/5/2015,2.0,Located within the Tanforan Shopping Center next to Barnes and Nobles Books. Came in here with a friend to have a few beers  food  and some conversation. Wasn't very crowded in the middle of the day in a busy shopping center. The layout of the restaurant is similar to all the other BJ's I've ever been at in Northern California. We sat in the bar area and ordered their hefeweizen beer and some appetizers. We ordered their Chicken Wings (with the hot sauce on the side)  the Pepperoni Extreme flatbread pizza  and their Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. It had twice cooked shredded pork  roasted green chili sauce and jack and cheddar cheese  and was topped with freshly chopped onions and cilantro. Frankly  the Carnitas Fries was not very good in my opinion  as it was rather bland and the shredded carnitas themselves were disappointing. Service was reasonable  but we had to ask for small individual serving plates and silverware. It's what I expected from BJ's  a chain brewery hangout. Wasn't bad  but wasn't great. It is what is is  hit and miss.
Courtney Q.,San Francisco  CA,447,137,71,7/22/2014,2.0,BJ's just aint what it used to be. I've ordered the chicken baked potato every time ive been to BJs for years now and it just isnt up to par with what it used to be. Went from delicious to just a meh super starchy thing. The size of it also went WAY down. I remember the first time I got it  my eyes lit up as they marveled at the sheer enormity of the potato. On the plus side  it comes with a salad now. You have to find the potato on the lunch menu (you can still order it for dinner) if you want to order it.It wasn't just the potato that lost its grandeur though. My friend sitting next to me got one of their pastas and she said it used to be super yummy but was just bland now.The server was accommodating for our large group of 10 or so  and you still get the birthday pizookie.
Jade T.,San Francisco  CA,157,325,1069,5/25/2014,2.0,"Came here because one of my friends and I like to have Pizookie dates once a year.. and we didn\'t like our experience at this one at all.The decor feels a bit outdated compared to the other BJs  with low ceilings and very dark lights. It was incredibly busy on a week night (and hearing from others  it seems like it\'s packed everyday) and the servers just seemed really unprofessional. They were commenting on other patrons  rolling their eyes and two walked by adjusting their pants.. enough that they should have just done it in a back room / bathroom. Nobody wants to see that while eating  c\'mon.My pasta dish was okay  while the salad was so bland that my vegetarian friend couldn\'t even finish it. We were sure some ingredients had been left off of it. The funniest part was when our Pizookie came. It looked burnt all around the edges  and when my friend tried to spoon some.. she couldn\'t even break through the top crust! We laughed  which attracted the attention of our server  who asked if it was too hard. When we said yes  he said he thought so... then why would he still bring it out? He ended up replacing it with a ""good"" one  no harm done.Overall off experience  but hey.. at least it\'s only once a year! I gotta say though.. a hard Pizookie is a very sad Pizookie!"
Cheryl M.,San Francisco  CA,99,11,2,2/16/2014,2.0,* wrote this review at the restaurant as it happened- host told us it was a 20 min wait for two people. After about 35 mins  we decided to go inside to ask how much longer. They messed up and said the reason why it took longer is because they put us down for four. Uh doesn't make sense.- got seated outside (area by Barnes and Noble) at a table that's seriously hidden which also didn't make sense because there were two booths open. When the host brought us to our table  we saw that there were still plates and cups.- waited about 15 mins for our server.- complained about how there was something in my water and got no apology.- all the workers that came to our table were impolite Literally 5 mins after we got our food we decided to just take the food to go. The stars are for the food..and how much tip I left. Ha!
Sharon L.,San Francisco  CA,184,84,135,1/8/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Went last night:Avocado eggrolls: DELISH! should have tried this sooner! Mac and cheese appetizer: Good dish for someone not too hungrySalmon creation: (broiled) oh my gosh. the salmon was fresh and tasty. the top broiled was crunchy ans not too burnt. so good with the sauce. the rice... could eat it for days!!!! has a fair amount of veggies that balance out the dish perfectly. PLUS  had a bowl of soup in the beginning (clam chowder! :) )Almond raspberry pizookie: not my fav :\\ it was alright but wouldn't get again. had alot of almonds. im not a nut person (the BF is)
Nichole P.,San Francisco  CA,0,6,1,10/4/2015,1.0,No stars! I have no idea why I eat here but this is certainly the last time. Was seated and waited for 15 minutes  no one and I mean no one stop by our table. Yet the people seated next to us (who came in afterward my party)  were served drinks before us. Finally just got up and left. Took my money to Red Robins!
Kat S.,Diamond Bar  CA,220,45,19,12/29/2013,1.0,My uncle and I came here today for lunch and we waited about 20-25 minutes. When we were about to be seated the table wasn't even cleaned off or sanitized off. So we were just standing there waiting for a busser to come clean it. Our server didn't provide utensils before our meals arrived and had to ask for them  which took a while. At this point we were kind of irritated already. I had ordered a side salad with my entree and my server didn't write it down and I never received it. And when we ordered our dessert it took maybe more than 20 minutes just for a pizookie. And we even got our check before our dessert was even served. So disappointed at this location because all the other times I've been to Bjs service had been great. Sad to say that I won't be returning to this location.
Tee L.,Las Vegas  NV,11,191,3,7/15/2014,2.0,Stopped in to meet a friend for a light bite/ happy hourI m not a beer drinker  and happy hour menu is limitedService was ok  had to call out to find our waiter  as we found a table in the bar area  looks like the previous people did not like their burger was barely half eaten. Got our waiter to clean up and take our order..Lettuce wraps was ok   nothing to write home about  yes the avocado rolls were slightly better    sliders a little overdone.This is my first visit here  I think I' ll pass and go somewhere else  next time.
Christina P.,San Francisco  CA,6,120,7,6/15/2014,2.0,Service - super friendlyFood - meh... to lackluster. And this is based on some of the menu items recommended by the waiter. My $12 pasta tasted like Kraft dinner. My friend's pizza was teeny tiny and burnt. The reason that this place isn't demoted down to 1 star is because of the wait staff that really did try to be friendly and helpful  and because of its location. That mall has only few sit-down and dine options within the mall (others being Hooters  and Vietnamese restaurant)
Keng G.,South San Francisco  CA,133,55,5,7/8/2015,1.0,The hostesses are very welcoming. Some servers lack customer service such as checking up on the table even if it's every 10 minutes. Food quality is getting smaller and worse. Chefs lack presentation as well as the quality of the food. They suck. If Chef Gordon Ramsay were to review this BJ's location  he would cuss out the managers for allowing this to happen. The drinks/beers are good though. I'll give them that.
Kristen T.,Beverly Crest  Los Angeles  CA,2,11,1,4/2/2015,1.0,We were told it would be about a 20 to 30 minute wait to be seated when 30 minutes was up we were told another 20 minutes on top of that. After about an hour wait we were finally seated with no silverware and our waiter took another 15 minutes to get our drink orders. Another 30 minutes later our food finally came and it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time because the noodles in my pasta were crunchy and stuck together and it was not warm. We still had no silverware. The manger did have new pastas made which took another 30 minutes. Another girls avocado egg rolls were made with rotten avocados and looked brown and mushy! This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant!
Rikki S.,San Pablo  CA,87,78,59,1/29/2014,3.0,Not a big fan of thier food but def like thier beer and pazookie!! Love the pazookie!! My fav is chocolate chip with ice cream.. very traditional yet very good. After work I was craving a beer and a pazookie soi went to bjs with my brother and had one. Didn't get a beer bit tried thier mojitos.. It was good but I still prefer skates mojitos better ..
Wayne W.,San Francisco  CA,79,96,2,7/3/2014,4.0,I came here a few times but the latest one was with a group of good friends from work. The food is great and the atmophere is wonderful. The prices is not too bad actually. If you are into sports and you want to keep up with whatever event is going on then this is the place to go to. Staff is friendly  the wait wasn't too long so no complaints. The deserts are to die for and not to mention their chicken wings. My friend Pinky ordered them and I tried one  wow! Better than Wing Stop. Highly recommend this place  parking is easy too!
Dave F.,Santa Monica  CA,277,1442,154,8/4/2012,5.0,This BJ's has a 5 star staff!!!!!I was enjoying a casual meal here  but was in a bit of a hurry to go home to Santa Monica. I paid the bill and bolted to SFO rental car return. On my way to the terminal  I realized I left a really expensive pair of sun glasses on the table. No worries  because I had the receipt with the kind server's name.After calling the restaurant and speaking to the manager  they actually returned my sunglasses all boxed up in a nice USPS cardboard box!!!! Wow  great service. What more can I say?Thank you  BJ's--San Bruno! You guys rock!
Erika G.,Livermore  CA,362,750,420,8/3/2012,3.0,I came in during the week for lunch with co-worker. Service was eh  she seemed preoccupied  not in a fun joking mood. Just all business. I ordered a lunch size pasta dish and it was good enough for me to eat it all. I don't remember the name of it but it had angel hair pasta  sundried tomatoes  garlic and i think feta. It wasn't stellar because I really can't remember exactly what I ate.My friend also ordered a lunch pasta dish. Similar to mine.We also shared a mini pazookie. Regular cookie size but a warm freshly back chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream scoop - that was awesome!! Prices were reasonable  wait during lunchtime wasn't too bad.Sign up for their customer card - you get points for free stuff.
Patricia G.,San Francisco  CA,14,42,12,7/22/2015,1.0,Use to like BJ's but not anymore. Beer selection is pretty good! Service last night sucked. Waiter only check on us twice! To get our order and to refill my drink! Waiter was nice  but was too busy with his own friends to pay attention to our table. Would've wanted dessert but I decided against it because of the bad service and I didn't want to wait for him to forget my dessert. Bad birthday dinner  all I wanted was the pizookie! Over BJ's!!!
Matt Y.,Orinda  CA,194,381,2226,12/24/2012,3.0,"12/23/12 LunchYour regular fancy-diner-in-the-mall type of place. We came here to take a break from shopping and took refuge from the crazy blustery day. This restaurant is huge with so many booths. It somehow reminds me of Elephant Bar. For a brewery house they have good cocktails. The ""Guilt-free Cosmo"" (with Ketel One  Monin sugar-free triple sec  cranberry juice and fresh lime) is good without that horrible after taste from sugar substitute. Food is okay:*BJ Favorite pizza - thin-crusted  loaded with bell peppers  lives  and bits of sausage. It\'s tasty but not as good as California Pizza Kitchen. *""Enlightened"" Thai mango Salad - just what I expected  with mixed greens  arugula  slices of mango  avocado. Would be perfect if they put less dressing since the salad is all soggy at the bottom.Service was prompt and friendly."
Addy Y.,San Francisco  CA,420,53,148,1/7/2014,2.0,It was an alright experience. I don't think it was worth our wait nor the cost of food.We waited over 2 hours for a table for 8. Yes  my friend didn't make reservations prior  but I think it's reasonable to let your customers know you can't sit there forever.After quite some wait for the waiter to come around with water  then to take our orders  I asked for the BlueHouse cheeseburger w/ wedge-cut fries. The fries were good  but the burger was nothing special nor worth the $9-10. It was just a bit over the size of an In-N-Out burger  and the meat was dry and flavorless. My friends ordered some drinks  and the cider was fruity  fizzy  and you can hardly taste the alcohol (I'm not saying this is a bad thing  though!)Regarding the service  some of my friends ordered thin-cut fries but received fries that were wedge-cut. The waiter informed us after we all received our dishes that they had ran out of thin-cut fries. I know this may not seem like a big deal  but customer service-oriented workers would make sure that their clients knew what they would be paying for beforehand. I  for a fact  would've ordered a salad if they ran out of wedge-cut fries.We were celebrating my friend's birthday  so we ordered a 3-set mini pizooki platter: red velvet  double chocolate  and white macadamia (not sure of the actual dish names). The dessert took a while to arrive  but eventually  out of the corner of my eye  our waitress seems to walk in slo-mo as she delivers our pizooki topped with ... half-melted vanilla ice cream. This was the most disheartening part of the night for me. I've been to BJ's before and I was never served dripping  melted  sad ice cream. Considering that the double chocolate cookie was very yummy  its presentation was a huge disappointment.Also  my friend ordered a pasta dish and got food poisoning the next morning.
Eugenia F.,Deerfield Beach  FL,1,49,22,8/5/2015,2.0,I heard that it wasn't so good so put off going. Finally hubby went and liked it. We went on a Tuesday for dinner. We were seated after 5 minutes as promised  I had the clam chowder  Brussels sprouts  and we split a full rack of ribs. All were mediocre and the atmosphere was not cozy. Probably will try again for the thin pizza. Service was slow and we had to direct someone else to get check.
Shae B.,Bayview-Hunters Point  San Francisco  CA,0,5,23,3/14/2014,1.0,Really good food however  take out service is horrible. Called to order before I came and still had to wait 20mins. Once my order came it was very incorrect. I took it anyway but the decided to come back to return it after taking a peak at it in my car. When I told the takeout server I didn't want it and could the remake the correct order  she said yes and I had to wait an additional 30mins. While waiting I overheard other dissatisfied takeout customers and the server repeatedly apologizing.
Will M.,San Bruno  CA,13,1,6,8/4/2015,5.0,Very impressed by our server: Andrew. I've been to this BJ's so many times and Andrew is by far the best server I've had yet.
Deira R.,South San Francisco  CA,0,7,,8/29/2015,1.0,I would come here with my best friend and family all the time but their service is just awful. The last 3 times I was there. Again 3 times in a row we waited for an hour for our meal and another 45 minutes for a dessert after we complained about the service . keep in mind the restaurant wasn't even busy. the food is cold by the time we got it which sucks because we already waited an hour for our food. Just no I don't know what else to say.
Rena H.,San Francisco  CA,22,44,24,6/19/2013,4.0,never had an entire meal of food here  but it is a pretty great place for a dessert and booze with the girls. I have come here for pizookies and cocktails on several occassions and have always been treated very well  even though I'm not ordering a whole lot. pizookie....
Judith L.,San Francisco  CA,298,140,311,12/6/2012,3.0,"BJ\'s is always a good place to go for a quick bite if you don\'t know what you\'re craving for. It has a wide variety to choose from and there\'s bound to be something that will catch your eye..or should I say your stomach? If you\'re looking for something small  I\'d say try the gourmet Mac n cheese. ""What makes it so gourmet?""""I don\'t know...the bacon? The bread on the side? The bread crumbs sprinkled on the top?""I don\'t know if that makes this Mac n cheese gourmet or not but it definitely makes a good snack. It\'s pretty cheesy and best eaten when it\'s hot  so remember not to leave it for last. I\'ve also had the ahi-tuna salad before. It was after the gym so I had to have something light or else...man  all that effort wasted. It was definitely a good choice. It was filling yet light. The tuna complimented the salad well. The chicken quesadillas were so-so. It\'s a cheap meal for lunch  but not satisfying. D had the Chicken Marsala once and he said the noodles were a bit hard.But definitely get the pizookie if you want dessert!! I get the red velvet one every time. Super delicious but not something you can finish by yourself (unless you have a super big sweet tooth).Long story short: The food can be a hit-or-miss but BJ\'s is just one of those places where you don\'t pay for amazing food or expect too much. The service is definitely forgettable though. Sometimes you have to ask five times just for a glass or water. Just don\'t have too high of an expectation and you\'ll be satisfied enough."
Tiffany W.,San Bruno  CA,35,618,5,11/13/2012,1.0,We came here for dinner tonight b/c we had to order something at Sears. I wanted to go to Jack's across the street but my partner wanted to come here. I ordered an Atlantic salmon & he ordered Mahi Mahi over fried rice. I ate 1/3 of my fish and 1/2 of my rice. Rice was bland. Steamed veggies consisted mostly of steamed squash. It was bland and horrible. Almost not consumable. It came with a soup--I had the tomato bisque. His dish was not enough for him and he wanted to order more. Since i wasn't too thrilled with my order  he ended up eating the rest of my meal. Food took a looong time to come. Prices were abit high  especially for such poor quality food. I'd go to Jack's next time. Not only better food  bigger portions with lots of veggies.I've been here once before and i had the chicken salad but you can't really screw up on salad.
Erica T.,San Francisco  CA,428,318,619,5/8/2012,3.0,Like all of the other reviewers  every time I come here  there is always a 30+ min wait. A table of 4  we decided to find a seat at the bar area  wait time = less than 10 mins (if you get lucky and snag a table before everyone else does). Crispy Jalapeno Burger - Fried jalapenos  pepper jack cheese  chipotle mayonnaise  Baja sauce  red onions  tomato  lettuce and chopped cilantro. (med rare with wedge fries) $9.95: Cooked perfectly. This burger was pretty awesome. So much meat and so much toppings and the chipotle mayo (but next time I will ask for it on the side because there was a bit too much mayo). Fries were also awesome. Thick cut wedge fries... MMmmmmm. This burger was so big that I wasn't able to finish it. I gave my bf the other half and still was stuffed after. I soo recommend this!New Orleans Jambalaya $15.50: This was also really good  a lot of peppers (so if you don't like peppers  don't order this dish). The shrimp is also big enough to notice and taste. Downside to this dish is that they didn't cut the sausage up completely  so you get one whole sausage slices connected by the outer skin... no bueno. But dish was full of flavor.Service is really slow  we didn't get our drinks tell really late and didn't get our check for the longest time. We started to get anxious because we had a movie to get to.
Colleen M.,San Francisco  CA,627,505,356,4/23/2010,2.0,"There\'s something wrong with a restaurant when the workers can\'t explain what the name ""BJ\'s"" stands for... Just kidding  I\'m sure it\'s just a name. They gave me the weirdest look when I asked  though. You would think that they get it a lot!The food was so sub-par that I don\'t quite remember anything about what I had ordered or eaten. Some kind of deep-dish pizza  I think. The service was slow  and the food came out lukewarm.Ah  THAT was what happened.If not for the pazookie - which I found AMAZING; former pazookie virgin here! - I wouldn\'t even bother giving this place two stars.I might even choose to head over to Chuck E Cheese instead. Their name makes complete sense  they have a skateboarding rat as a mascot  AND their pizza is made both hot and quickly. Winner!"
Jen C.,San Diego  CA,0,17,1,10/4/2015,1.0,We were turned off by the slow service. Waited forever for our food  and did not receive any updates from the server in regards to the delay. She seemed more interested in one of the male servers than in her customers. I kept seeing her just standing there talking with this one guy  which is cool if you would have taken care of your customers first. My pizza was served cold and not even cut through into slices.
Grence Whinsel D.,Pleasanton  CA,21,5,,8/18/2015,3.0,Hit and miss with the service here. Youre mostly paying for the environment. Food is mediocre. Theur desserts are the only thing worth buying but thats just my opinion.
Vanita N.,Daly City  CA,0,8,10,3/4/2016,1.0,The service sucks most of the waitress disappears for 30 to 45 minutes they all go to the back and food comes after 30 to 1 hour after ordering..not worth it
Craig T.,San Jose  CA,90,50,3,6/27/2014,2.0,"Inconsistent-ville.  It\'s really hit or miss with this Bj\'s. Tonight I was served a wilted warm Caesar salad and a ribeye well below the requested medium cook temperature. If it weren\'t for a great waitress I\'d give this place a single star since you cannot give a zero star. Some nights it\'s great service and food. Some nights not so much.  Rather annoying. I guess the smoke and mirrors of serving ""hand craft beer"" is enough for some. Starting to wonder if BJs has outgrown themselves and is becoming more of a Chili\'s."
T. W.,El Dorado Hills  CA,0,425,202,3/24/2015,3.0,It's your typical BJ's. Diverse menu  mediocre food and service.
Sarmad N.,San Leandro  CA,467,288,145,5/10/2014,4.0,I made reservations here for my wife's birthday party about a week ahead of time. They told me they would not allow a party our size to split our check. This caused issues but none the less we still decided to deal with it. The day off they called and confirmed our party. When we arrived we were seated quickly and they got drinks to us very fast. However it seems like some of their wait staff didnt show up and they seemed like they were short staffed despite that they delivered good service. They didn't rush us on leaving even though the restaurant got filled up and they did allow us to split the checks as apposed to having me pay and then get paid back from my group. Over all this was a very good experience. I would return and highly recommended them.The food was good. Too many items with high amount of calories. They did have alternatives with healthier options.
Cyrillo N.,Daly City  CA,127,20,3,8/8/2014,1.0,"Hello!!I went to BJ\'s last sunday on lunch time and I got surprise with the customer survice from the bartender he\'s name is ""JAMES"".My girlfriend had asked to him: Hey how\'s ur day going?? And JAMES just looking to my girl on bad face and saying to her: my day is not doing good.... Is not good!!!!! At the same time I tought really??? That\'s the way u have to say for my girl??? Hummmm... Ok..... We wish to cancel the bill but we was soooo f... Hungry Food was good anyways...My deal with BJ\'s from now is: if I go there next time and see "" STUPID JAMES"" over there  I\'ll asking for leaving!!!!I\'m sorry BJ\'s.Thank you."
Regine L.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,1,9/10/2016,1.0,"Terrible Experience. TRISTAN WAS TERRIBLE. We came in on a slow day around 3 PM. We were sat at the balcony section and was approached by our server. He came and did not introduce himself  but instead said ""want somethin\' to drink? Ready for your order? Or did you just sit down?"" All in one breath. Luckily  we\'re regular comers so we knew what we wanted. I ordered strawberry mojito and my friend ordered a strawberry margarita. The strawberry mojito had no alcohol taste but had plenty of soda. I asked for a different drink and it still tasted more as a soda than an alcoholic drink. As for the appetizer  we ordered a lettuce wrap that came with a half-ass presentation of sloppiness. Then he asked if we wanted plates to go with that. Why would you ask if we want plates?! YES WE WANT PLATES. LET ME EAT OFF THE DAMN TABLE. To make matters worse  we also had to ask for silverware and napkins  since he didn\'t give us any. Waited an average of 30 min for our appetizers. Not once did he check up on how the replacement drink was nor the appetizers. For entrees  I ordered a cherry chipotle glazed salmon and my friend ordered a burger. Waited another 40 min. Total wait was more than an hour. Once again  the server did not check up on how our meal was. Our server name was Tristan. DO NOT GET HIM. Oh and he had the audacity to run out and yell if we payed. Ummm.. Do you want to see my receipt?"
Dylan V.,San Francisco  CA,0,11,,2/25/2016,1.0,I would think that coming to this BJs would improve  but they always fail in service  food quality  and wait. I ordered food and it took 20 minutes longer than everybody else. And as soon as i got my food they didn't even have the whole meal ready. They had to give my fries later and that additionally took another 15 minutes when i was already almost done with my food. This BJs just sucks in general and id rather go to the food court then pay for this over priced shitty food. Additionally  out waiter Matt just sucks as a waiter. He didn't give any refills on water or soda through our whole stay  and didn't even to check how our shitty food was. If you get Matt prepare yourself for some shitty service.
Nick L.,San Bruno  CA,1,121,1,8/2/2015,5.0,OK...this place is probably actually only a 4  but I decided to give it a compensating 5. People downgrading a restaurant because it is always packed really have Yogi Berra's disease. Food is consistently good - never had a bad meal there (out of 10 or so meals). I bit understaffed with waiters  but they are consistently of decent cheer. It's unlikely that you'll get a bad meal there and will sometimes have a great one.
Mychael H.,Hayward  CA,501,46,2908,3/2/2014,5.0,This is one of my favorite restaurant to go to because I like the food here is good and the alcohol is good it's a great place to watch your favorite sport team here. Rather come on Happy Hours.
Calvin John B.,Honolulu  HI,365,118,49,1/4/2014,2.0,Of the three times that I've eaten there  never have I been completely satisfied with anything other than their beer. Whether it be service or food  most things I've experienced here were just sub-par. I'm not one to complain too often  but you start to question what is acceptable in terms of the standard of food preparation  quality  taste  and so forth.I'm a pasta person. Parmigiana's  lasagna's spaghetti's and linguini's are my cushion so if it's there  I'll go for it! Every time I get those here  they for some reason end up with only a scoop-full of sauce with the pasta as dry as the desert. Steaks  chickens and other meats are a toss up. Sometimes they're well cooked and other times they're just plain chewy.My most recent trip  and one that nudged me into writing this review  was with a group of co-workers and I for a holiday dinner. One of us ordered take-out from our server for a steak. It came out burnt. We told the server what had happened but in turn we were told that cooks had already been told to prepare it the way we asked. Truth is  we were never asked. Adding to that  when we were ready to pay  we tried raising our hands each time he passed but it wasn't until fifteen minutes later where we eventually asked another server for ours to come by. At times  we even caught him helping other tables out then leaving for the back room again. When he finally came over  he collected our cards and didn't come back for another couple of minutes or so. The entire experience made us pull hairs  as we'd already had a long day at work to begin with.But not all is completely lost. There was a server that sat us and took our orders just fine. He talked stories for a bit  told us he'd been doing this for a very long time/ You can tell by the way he acted towards us - friendly and courteous. I would've been just fine with him as our server  but his shift was about to end and instead we got a newcomer. I'm not denouncing them  but I'm sure the more experienced ones have been through all sorts of craziness. At this point  I'm just going on a rant  but it really makes me think twice about planning another outing to BJ's again - at least to this location.
Sid G.,Union City  CA,6,64,150,1/20/2012,4.0,This BJ's is a life saver in the area where there are very few choices... The service here usually is prompt...the only thing abt this place is the wait time... The best thing to do is to Their brewery beers are top notch... I like the jermiah and the heff..
Smitha S.,Millbrae  CA,1,12,34,5/23/2015,5.0,Love love love their balsamic chicken. Its the third time I have been to Bj's and I have ordered the same dish all three times:). Also tried fried calamari  flatbread with chicken and avocados. They turned out great too. It is slightly expensive but the quantity and quality of food you get is impressive. As most of the reviews suggest  the wait time is really long. For us it was one hour. We spent the hour at the mall and when we came back our table was ready.
Patricia S.,San Francisco  CA,123,13,14,1/16/2012,3.0,"Came here with some friends the other day. First off  the waiter was kind of rude. I think his name was Tom but I\'m not sure. We asked for separate tabs and he gave us some look like  ""Uhhh  wtf? Okay? Fine."" Uhhh hello! Some of us like separate tabs so that we don\'t have to deal with who owes who what. Then  my friend gets his chili and it\'s lukewarm! Last time I checked  chili is supposed to be hot. We explained this to the waiter and we get another kind of look except it wasn\'t as obvious. (He probably heard us talking about the first time and giving a low tip because when he would come back  he was more energetic and upbeat with his tone.)So now I get my crispy chicken sandwich with fries. I love their thin-cut fries. Mmmm! As I was eating the sandwich  I noticed that the tomato was MUSH! Gross. It looked like it was a spread on my chicken instead. I tried to take it off but only the rim came off. That\'s how bad the tomato was. C\'mon BJ\'s! If I\'m paying $10 for a sandwich  the least you can do is give me a fresh tomato!And I\'d like to add that another time I came with a group of friends  our waitress was kind but was rushing us. It felt like she was trying to get us out asap. RUDE. About only 30 minutes into our meal  she was already asking us if we needed boxes. We weren\'t even done yet! -___- And this last time (I mentioned above)  our waiter was really slow. I needed a few more minutes to decide what to order  and he comes back like 10 minutes later and it wasn\'t even busy. Now I need a refill which I told him  and I wait another 5 minutes. BJ\'s needs to work on their service!"
Nida K.,Oakland  CA,20,379,62,12/8/2012,2.0,Okay. So the food was greasy and incredibly oily. Wait... those two things are the same thing  huh? Well anyway  the food was nasty and I got stomach aches from it through out the night. Also  the restaurant was very dirty. It looked like they hadn't dusted in weeks!! It was just unsanitary! The strawberry margarita was yummy and gave me a buzz which helped me swallow the food. Okay... so  I added 2 pictures at the end of the picture roll of how DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY this place was!! Please check them out! Pictures # 449-450 - to see my finger filled with the dust I swiped off the counter!
Jeff G.,San Francisco  CA,197,339,9,12/7/2014,2.0,Ehh... The food is always dependable. It's better than Chili's or Applebees. I guess what bugged me though was how slow and non-chalant the service was. We had just gotten back from a trip  it was our last opportunity for some late night  decent food. We were hungry. Really hungry. So to wait 15 minutes at a table without any greeting was almost enough for us to leave. We stayed out of hunger pains but still weren't impressed. Having been a server before  I always followed three rules: greet someone as soon as they sit down  keep drinks full and take care of the check quickly. Our server was 0 for 3. Knowing how difficult the job can be  I still left a decent tip. It could've been an off night or maybe he was having a rough day. Still though  it was an expensive meal for such crummy service.
Lisa K.,San Mateo  CA,0,5,,9/9/2016,4.0,"Stopped in to pick up some food to go with my 92 year old mom on the way back from Kaiser. Of course  she was tired (she\'s 92!)  so when the guy who took our order said 20-25 minutes  she said that was fine  she wanted some books from Barnes and Noble anyway. I set my phone timer for 25 minutes  and when it went off  checked out of the book store and headed back (making it 30 minutes). I was told it would be another 15 minutes or so. I told the guy we weren\'t going to wait  just give me a refund. So the manager comes over and said ""You asked for a manager?"" and I told him no  I just want my money back and be on my way  we can\'t wait any longer. He apologized sincerely  refunded my money  and asked if I could wait ONE more minute. I did  and our food was brought out and given to us free of charge. I honestly wasn\'t expecting a free meal  I was just incensed with the poor service. This has happened before at this BJ\'s with my daughter  and she told me to not leave a tip. I left a tip because I believe it is not the fault of the servers  but is due to poor management and training. The manager that took care of me today was new  and said he was aware of the problem  and was working on it. He handled my situation impeccably! I walked away from there happy and delighted instead of upset and thinking I would never go there again. This new manager is going to get BJ\'s 5 star ratings! Thank you"
Ariel S.,Mountain View  CA,3,33,,7/29/2015,4.0,They have good pizza  plenty of healthy entree choices which I enjoy  and lots of good appetizers. My favorite appetizer is the avocado eggrolls that I get with my family every time we go. They also have a good alcohol selection which makes sense seeing as it is a brewery as well. I like going here and frequently do with my family as a tradition.
Alayna's Momma S.,San Bruno  CA,0,104,24,6/29/2015,5.0,I came here a few times  and I've always walked out satisfied! Stuffed mushrooms are my favorite.
Lyn D.,San Francisco  CA,45,9,13,6/3/2015,4.0,Good service  I had spring chicken burger with bottomless fries. Good place for comfort food. The server is nice and friendly.
Neysa O.,Plano  TX,103,6,1,12/6/2014,1.0,Terrible customer service! Were told the wait was 45 min. Turned into a hour and 10 min. There were 3 of us. They brought the first meal before anyone else's. The second meal came 10 min later but was brought out wrong. So waited another 10 minutes or so for the fixed meal. Then we had to ask for the third meal. Which came out 25 min or more later. Never coming again.
Brandon N.,Redwood City  CA,165,158,10,3/24/2014,3.0,Had lunch here today and was greeted by a nice host and waiter. Our table had a slightly peculiar odor surrounding it  but it didnt bother me and my party enough to ask for a move. Had the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. Caesar salad had a few pieces of limp lettuce  so I didnt ask for 2nds. 1st bowl was the clam chowder. It was one of the better soups at BJs. Pretty good amount of some good-size clams and creamy but not overly creamy soup. Next was tortilla soup. At first  they give you a dry bowl of tortilla chips  avocado and lime. Then they have a secondary container where the pour from to combine the soup with the dry ingredients  right at the table. Pretty cool from a presentation standpoint. Tortilla soup was overly salty but good. Last up was the chili. I didn't have any  but my friend reported that it had an ale flavor about it. Not my cup of tea so i passed.2 stars for the food  extra star for the employees.
Kiho K.,San Jose  CA,1,17,,5/29/2015,1.0,Worst experience ever! Manager was an idiot! Food was just okay! Server was okay! Experience was the worst ever! I will never step my feet into that establishment!!!!
Muncea M.,San Mateo  CA,1,5,,7/23/2014,2.0,Terrible food good service So we visited the restaurant on a Wednesday it was pretty packed. They first sat us on a dirty table wtf??? Then our waiter came and took our orders. He was nice and all but he forgot our appetizer plate. He ended up not charging us though  And the food sucked! The salmon was smelly and totally not fresh and the pasta with meatballs had no flavor whatsoever. Awful food seriously
Cody R.,Daly City  CA,0,8,,6/21/2015,1.0,NEVER-EVER-EVER order take-out from here. Here's the timeline... I ordered online far in advance at 7:40 for pickup at 8:20. At 8:20 I arrived on-time to pick up  before being told it wasn't ready. Time waiting before food was ready to go... 8:55. So ultimately  I waited 35 minutes AFTER my pick-up time. All that extra time they needed  you might think they would use a few minutes to make sure the order was correct  NOPE!
Kathy B.,Daly City  CA,102,15,42,5/3/2015,1.0,"Don\'t really know what to say. We had bad service right from the beginning. We took a table that a server was starting to clear. He didn\'t come back to finish clearing it until six minutes after we sat down. When he took our food order  he said he can\'t guarantee that the appetizer will arrive before our main meal (what about placing the appetizer order first then put in our dinner order a few minutes later? Just a suggestion...). We told him it was fine. Dinner plates came  no appetizers. Ten minutes into our dinner  I asked if the appetizers were still coming. ""I\'ll check on it for you."" Really? We ended up bringing the appetizers home - took three requests to get to go containers. The only thing he did fast was get our bill to us."
Kevin T.,San Diego  CA,27,9,9,12/23/2013,1.0,Went with family here to eat for dinner after the 49ers game. The lady at the counter was very polite after we waited for a table. It took 30 minutes for the food to come out and that was only the salad. They even served us the salads without utensils. In addition  our waiter just disappeared after placing our order. I managed to flag down a different waiter to request cheese for my baked potato  but he never came back. Our main server hardly checked on us  we had to call three different waiters for our requests  such as sauce  condiments  and the bill. Overall  the service was horrible. We had to call a different waiter to tell the manager to get our bill. The food quality lacked. I had the New York steak which was on the dry side. My sister ordered the Top Sirloin with Lobster and the lobster didn't come out. We requested a separate dish for the lobster and ended up with a whole new plate including the sides and top sirloin; we got charged twice..
Diane E.,San Francisco  CA,170,3,,7/18/2015,4.0,Every time I go here I get a burger  fries and a mimosa. Both are always good and the servers are nice. The bartenders are very nice as well.
Alessandra T.,Brisbane  CA,1,71,75,5/21/2014,4.0,You have to know what to order here. My son loves the kids MAC and cheese so if he is happy I am happy. Normally they serve lots of food do we eat it for dinner :)
Krystal S.,Bayview-Hunters Point  San Francisco  CA,71,41,56,12/19/2013,4.0,This place has really big TVs all around the joint so it's an ideal place for watching any type of sports  on the bad side this place gets pretty packed any night of the week so you can be waiting for up to 45 minutes or longer that is the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars. The food is awesome tho...I've had the pizza  pasta  salmon  appetizers and even the drinks are yummy!!! The service isn't bad either I have never had a bad experience with a server so far. So if you ever get hungry after a long day of shopping and do not want food court food come to bj's at Tanforan you won't be disappointed! Oh I forgot to mention they brew their own beer here and I have tried the pale ales all the way to the dark and they are sure to have one for every type.
Azinda M.,Chicago  IL,28,287,8,3/14/2014,2.0,I usually love BJs  and their food is great  so no problems there. I recommend their spicy tomato pasta  tacos  any of their pizzas  and especially their pizookies-- YUM. My favorite is the Oreo  but they're all good--definitely get one if you're here.As for the service  it was HORRIBLE the last time I went. They took 10-15 minutes just to get us water!!! That's absolutely ridiculous  in my opinion. I couldn't believe how bad that was. Not only that  after they took our order (2 appetizers and a pizookie)  we waited another hour for our food to show up. Horrible horrible service. Go here if you don't mind using the wait to chat with your friends or family  but definitely not if you're in a rush.
Nanooje N.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,0,18,,7/12/2015,1.0,"Service is great and the beer is good. Food tastes like it has been microwaved and served. Pizza is a pile of grease  sliders look like they have been stepped on  and the ""fresh avocado rolls"" are a fresh shade of brown."
David M.,San Francisco  CA,169,32,16,4/1/2014,1.0,"Don\'t be fooled. This ""brewhouse"" is just another corporate sham. The service is shoddy -- bring the wrong food out  apps coming out at the same time as entrees  lack of customer service -- the food is meh  and their ""Deep-Dish"" pizza has nothing deep dish about it. It needs to be re-named ""Thick-Crust"" pizza. Deep dish pizza has sauce on top with pie-like attributes. As Kevin Sorbo once said  ""DISAPPOINTED!"""
Leanne P.,Milpitas  CA,346,797,155,6/1/2012,4.0,"This BJ\'s is a fairly busy one so everyone needs to understand--you\'re going to have to wait!I went here with my brother when our parents\' flight got delayed. We realized we had over an hour to kill. We were both a little hungry so we decided to check out BJ\'s. We\'ve been to BJ\'s before  but this was our first time at this location. There were a LOT of people waiting  so I was pleasantly surprised when we got a table for two in less than 10 minutes. I loved the layout--its a smaller location (because its attached to the mall) but they had a lot of ""mini-booths"" that just sit 2 people. Bro and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza and a tomato and mozzerella small salad. I also ordered a root beer. OMG everything was soooooooooooo yummy! The service was super quick and our food was scrumptious! I was only sad because I didn\'t have room for pizookie :("
Aaron W.,Davis  CA,1,26,7,6/29/2015,2.0,The beer is just ok  the ciders are too sweet and the appetizers are meager: we got 5 potstickers for $11. That's US currency!
Brandon Y.,San Jose  CA,821,599,1124,3/27/2012,2.0,It was one of my first happy hours with co-workers about a week ago  and I was looking forward to appetizers and drinks after a long day of work  so we decided to come to this BJ's.There weren't too many people there on a Wednesday afternoon  so seating 12 of us was rather easy  except for how we had to squish everyone in at those high tables. $2 off appetizers was nice  and I got potato skins  which were surprisingly good with the sauce they provided..it kind of tasted like a bleu cheese dressing almost  but that  along with the company was probably the best part of the gathering.BJ's Blonde Ale was just alright  and I finished it pretty quickly  but the trouble came when the waitress delivered the check...first  she refused to split the check by person and then gave us a max of 6 transactions  forcing a lot of us to use cash. Not only that  but after we figured out how much everyone owed with tax and tip included  we put the amount we wanted charged on each card on the receipt. Upon getting the cards back  not only did the waitress charge someone twice  but there was tip added on to the amounts that we had written down  and cash was given in a ten and a five dollar bill...we were so confused as to why she did not take the cash and charged what we had asked on the cards. Being way too confusing to work out each individual person's  we just coped with it and attempted to split the cash afterwards  but that latter part of happy hour was mostly raised eyebrows and arms as to why the waitress did this...I guess next time  we'll just have to come with less ppl so it is less confusing for them?...hrm.
Nelle L.,Monterey Heights  San Francisco  CA,0,105,12,5/2/2014,4.0,Extensive menu. Nice smooth handcrafted beer. Especially favor the hopstorm ipa.Appetizer is Ahi Poke just light and refreshing. Ahi poke pairs very well with the sante fe spring rolls. Must try the clam chowder with loads of clam. Next try the deep dish pizza. Just robust enough. Overall come in for the hand crafted beers and many tv screens.
Mike P.,San Bruno  CA,1,9,,7/28/2015,3.0,I've been here a number of times over the years since they openend. They have decent food  but slow service. Parking in the Tanforan lot can be a chore. Prices are decent for the quality of the food  but there are much better options in the area.They do have a broad selection though  including some gluten free itrms  and if you like beer they have several pages of options.If you're meeting people or want something better than food court fare at the Tanforan mall  it's ok. Otherwise  not really worth the wait.
Amanda B.,Santa Rosa  CA,4,90,347,2/22/2015,1.0,"Avoid this place like the plague! Slow service and atrocious communication between servers and kitchen staff. Even after discussing all the problems we had with the manager  we felt like our complaints fell on deaf ears. On top of that  when our second waiter of the night brought the bill  he said ""the manager took care of you guys  so have a good night."" Which sounds to a reasonable person as though our bill (which came to about $40) was comped. Nope!!!! They basically took off the items that we ordered and showed up AFTER we finished dinner  and that had been screwed up. Which we should not have had to pay for at all - so glad we didn\'t - but don\'t say the manager ""took care of"" us and mislead us about how you\'re making up for horrendous service! What a joke. Go anywhere else."
Janice C.,San Francisco  CA,509,2111,5512,7/23/2009,4.0,I like BJ's.Why? Because they offer choices that will feed even the pickiest of eaters. My gfs and I took our time deciding what to order  because frankly  there are 100 items on the menu. Between cocktail and beer choices  pasta  sandwiches  salads  house entrees and of course  deep dish pizza. Since I'm still a novice when it comes to the beer world  I just stuck with a Hefeweizen. I thought it went well with my BJ's favorite pizza -- meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  green peppers  olives  onions and tomatoes. My mouth was going chomp  chomp  chomp and I couldn't stop!!! The chicken parmesan with mashed potatoes was also good. For dessert  of course we had the pazookie! Chocolate ice cream on top of dark chocolate chip cookie  with a Ghirardelli chocolate square. Triple chocolate overload! (but in a good way)Our server Carlos was efficient and didn't bother us too much as we were too busy catching up on the gossip. Towards the end of the meal  he informed us that another server is taking over. 15 minutes later  the substitute waitress asked us if we want the bill. My gfs and I looked at each other. Is she sub-consciously telling us that we need to vacate the table???* I glanced at the time. Holy Mackerel! 8:45pm! *We've been here for about 3 1/2 hours!! With all that chomping and chatting we've been doing  no wonder my jaws hurt!
Elizabeth G.,El Cerrito  CA,92,156,474,2/2/2014,3.0,My first Time at BJs and i liked it the food was good and service was great. Order the potato skins and Cajun pasta dish and it was spicy and tasty garlic bread was good. The ice tea was unsweetened and i didn't know it order a tropical Ice tea and it was bitter. was seat by some very loud people had to change booth but waiter was really good.
Wine Advocate A.,San Francisco  CA,0,14,,5/23/2014,4.0,Food is great with vast selection of beer and wine. Their happy hour is seriously unbeatable with the best value  and yes  tasty!Only problem is that the service is too slow. Extremely slow. The staff is friendly and I don't understand how they keep a smile when there are so many people complaining about the slow service (like me). Kudos to them for a great attitude.Definitely a nice place to hang  if you're not in a terrible hurry.TIP: You must try the Cheeseburger pizza. It's a concoction of Pizza & Cheese burger - Amazzz. But you do need to walk a mile or two after.
Sheryel C.,San Mateo  CA,4,7,,2/20/2016,5.0,Probably the best experience I have ever had coming in here thanks to our wonderful server Fadi. The wait wasn't to bad for a friday night first off. After getting seated  literally the sweetest server ever  recommend soups to start our meal off  brought them out right away. Took our order  I had the fish tacos(asked if I wanted them grilled or fried!!) my brother had the chicken club sandwich. This is where it got a little iffy  we don't eat bacon  and the sandwich came out with bacon  BUT after pointing it out to Fadi  he took it right back to the kitchen and brought us out a new one without the bacon of course. After dinner we didn't have room for dessert but as an apology  Fadi brought us out a chocolate chip pazookie(my favorite). I would have to say  literally the best experience I have ever had here thanks to Fadi! Will defiantly request him to be my server next time I come in!
Tony Y.,Alameda  CA,47,82,8,1/30/2014,3.0,I have been coming here for years.Nice spot to hang out with your friends and drink.Food is decent. Service is OKI either come here or goto Hooters when Im in the area and looking for a drink
Ronnie Q.,Stonestown  San Francisco  CA,1,5,7,11/1/2014,1.0,Worst place ever. They tell you one hour  after an hour they tell you at least another half an hour to an hour. Don't ruin your mood just go someplace else!
Jialy Z.,Daly City  CA,7,8,1,4/24/2015,2.0,The food is just OK. But the service here is a joke. Because it's inside the mall  usually pretty busy here and has a long wait. Takes forever to have someone to take your order  and the moment you finish your meal they like to rush you out. If you like to stay longer to watch the game or just chat with your friends  you better order more stuffs. Or they will keep coming to check your bill.
Kamal S.,Mountain View  CA,0,4,1,6/18/2015,4.0,Aft the hooters today Bjs gave us great feel   wonderful   thanks a lot because aft a long time I saw my bestiesssss but it's such a great dine today thanks a lot !
Sarah C.,Redwood City  CA,331,280,124,8/31/2011,1.0,What happened to this BJ's? I've been to other BJ's and trust me their food is better and they're 10x cleaner.Ate here yesterday for lunch with my friend. The table we were seated at was dirty. The staff just wiped off the table but failed to check the floor. Food  utensils  dirty napkins you name it  it was on the floor of our table. I didn't want to make a big deal about it so I used my shoe to scoot all the junk to the side. Then we opened up our napkins to find dirty utensils. Old dried up bits of food were stuck to my fork. Yuck!The food itself was bland and nothing special. The wedge salad was watery and my grilled chicken and broccoli pasta had no flavor. The only thing that tasted okay was the fried calamari appetizer.Not returning to this location. Even a pizookie couldn't save this place. The location in San Mateo Bridgepointe is cleaner and for some reason has better quality food.
May B.,Daly City  CA,2,7,1,5/16/2015,2.0,I am sitting in the restaurant as i type this review. My boy friend and I have been sitting here for 30 minutes now and drinks have not been served and a group of 4 were seated AFTER us and have already placed their orders and received their drinks! If it weren't 11:15pm  we'd leave and find somewhere else to eat but since it's late  we'll have to settle. I understand that they are busy  if that is the case dont seat us at a table and have us wait while we watch others who were seated after us get served.
Vivian T.,Redwood City  CA,0,1,,1/31/2016,5.0,Just ate here with my family. Miguel served us and he was the best! Very attentive and made sure we have everything we needed. If you ever eat here  definitely ask for him by name.
Diana S.,Daly City  CA,261,6,2,11/18/2013,2.0,"A year ago--- I had a party of 12 to celebrate a friends birthday. We gathered our party to the bar area and was able to seat ourselves. First server was very nice but left us to another server. She was nice  busy and could do better in making is feel welcome to her section. We ordered. We waited for the whole party to join us than order so more. She didn\'t ring up our food up until we are all ready as a whole group.Finally we waited. Got our drinks  food and appetizers. THE FOOD RUNNER was absolutely rude. ""I have a pizza"" stares at us with a mad face making us feel we order something wrong. Simply made the mood of party a bummer. I let it go but my party was upset for the rude service. He comes back with more food and just stands there waiting for us to grab it and pass it down the long table. he goes ""I have a bunch of pizookies"" glares at us with an angry with the ""I don\'t like my job look"". I get upset and so does my party. Our server is trying her best to accommodate us but I felt she rushed us and could of gave us a better service but her efforts were there even though there was ALOT of mistakes.But this review is for the food runner. The overall tone was set when he rudely came up to our table. I took matters in my hand and asked for the manager. Great Guy!!! Heard me out and I explained to him our problem and overall experience. He apologize and was able to comp out desert. Overall I wanted to leave the store and let the manager know the situation. Business is based on good service and great food. I thank the manager for the time and hearing us out. One star more just for his accommodation."
Niko P.,Sacramento  CA,6,10,,9/9/2013,1.0,We decided to give BJ's one last good faith chance after our rough experience last time. What a mistake this was. BJ's has officially hit the bottom of the barrel. The experience started with the initial phone call to put our name down on our way in. We have never had a problem with this before and they supposedly welcome call ins. At least you would think so. The girl who answered the phone was rude and snarky. After 5 minutes of telling her that we had some it before she finally allowed it. She was rude from the get go. We should have taken that as a sign. Foolishly we continued forward. Next  terrible staff. Complete rush job to line their pockets. They rush you to order and are rude about it. I barely finished my order before the menu was ripped out of my hands. Same goes for my dining companion. While waiting forever for our food  we had a hovering employee literally standing behind our table starting and just waiting. Making us very uncomfortable. Also  it is quite apparent that texting and phone calls are more important than doing your job and talking care of the customer. I watched one girl flat out ignore a customer directly in her line of sight. Only to pull her phone out and type out a lengthy text and then walk away from said customer. Management isn't much better. Didn't care about any customer concerns or lack of customer service by his employees. He just stood there at the drink station doing nothing. Also having a terrible attitude. Finally the food gets there. This was after watching 3 innings of the baseball game totaling about 30 minutes. The pizza we ordered was very dry. Little to no sauce whatsoever. That is sad some their pizza used to be awesome. The cajun pasta was undercooked. Very stiff rubbery noodles. Couldn't even flag anyone down to bring it to their attention. The second it looked like we were done eating  the plates are snatched away and the check was on the table. Good thing I was done with my pasta. I wouldn't have had time to tell them I was still working on it. This is the worst experience I've had at BJ's ever. There will be no next time from us. Save yourself some money and go somewhere else. Even Hotdog on a Stick would be better than this. There are better places to go.
Infodiva B.,San Francisco  CA,1888,718,573,12/7/2014,3.0,I am trying to like this place as I don't have many alternatives in this neck of the woods. I like beer and the brew a nice selection and there is a full bar. I have tried two types of pizza  a variety of beers  appetizers and I feel the food is lacking and too salty or no taste at all.
Angela S.,South San Francisco  CA,51,164,115,3/25/2014,3.0,"When a business takes the time to read the reviews and make a comment  it tells me they care and it can change my opinion/feel towards the business. I plan to go back this month thanks to the owners comment.The food is always ok but not astounding. I don\'t really come here to dine. I come here to meet friends for a drink. My girlfriend and I met up for some appetizers and drinks. We had the following appetizers with the Root Beer drink with alcohol in it:Artichoke - they were okFried Calamari - it was just like any otherAvocado Egg Rolls - did not look anything like the picture. i\'ve had them before and they were pretty good. these ones were like pink and super spicy. did someone change the recipe to hot egg rolls with hidden avocado and not update the menu? no likey.Chicken Lettuce Wraps - these were the best. They were really good.The drinks were really good...when you could get them. While our waitress was nice she was mostly absent. I don\'t know if they were super busy (didn\'t look like it). We literally had to flag our waitress down for more drinks  water  water refills and she was short with us when we ordered dessert. We were both wondering what she was going to bring to the table as we both ordered the same thing and she started to walk away saying ""ok one of each"". We were like wuh? She didn\'t make eye contact with us when walking by our table. Thank goodness my friend was loud when she said ""excuse me"". We were there for over two hours. In her defense  we were talking and visiting so I can see why she didn\'t want to ""bug"" us but it was pretty bad still. It won\'t stop us from going back because we do get something out of it but I don\'t go for service or food really. Just convenience of location  pretty good apps and drinks."
Jenna H.,San Francisco  CA,352,235,15,10/16/2013,1.0,I wish I could give a review for the food  but sadly never got that far. I'll admit it was bad thinking on my part to come here on football sunday  but I was disappointed with their inaccurate and unorganized manner. Initially came and was told a 20min wait. My boyfriend and I put our name on the list and waited. We noticed there was a side area to eat in (in the mall) was was fairly empty. There were maybe 3 current parties in this section  and plenty of 2 or 4 seat tables. We asked if moving ourselves to that list would expedite our wait. One of the hostesses went to check  and said there were several parties on that list and it would take approximately 15 minutes. We thought it was odd  cause it was fairly open  but we decided to keep to our current estimated wait. 25 min later: we asked the hostess where we were on the list. She approximated another 20 minute wait. The boyfriend was too hungry so we decided to find something faster in the mall. As we walked out  we noticed the side area had maybe one larger party of 5 (in addition) that was in the area  but there were a couple 2-seat booths still available.Smh...
Brad D.,Pismo Beach  CA,0,1,,6/9/2015,1.0,Absolutely the worst place I have ever been. First and foremost  you don't turn away money ever. We were a party of eight eaters and drinkers and they said they can't seat us because it wouldn't be fair to the other small parties. Wtf!!!! Money is money you dumbass fucks!!!! You don't ever turn away a paying customer. Btw  the idiot you have working the checkin station  is the biggest problem. Get your head out of your asses and learn how to run a hospitality business!!!!!
Raquel Q.,San Francisco  CA,58,54,59,3/23/2014,4.0,Went for lunch w a friend and I had the low calorie shrimp tacos plate and a mozzarella ball salad. I love that they offer a low calorie menu for those days you just want to eat lite. Our waiter was great  he was very attentive. We were seated right away. I've been here many times and it's usually a good experience. On warm days I love sitting on the patio which is first come first serve. The bar areas fun too. But crowded. Lotsa TV's and music playing. I like it here.
Newton K.,Walnut Creek  CA,2,10,5,5/7/2015,4.0,Senior Manager Krystal and General Manager John did a stellar job at turning a negative experience into a positive. For that I am grateful and will return as a customer. Above all  the food was great! Thanks.
Alexander M.,Las Vegas  NV,399,976,2152,12/23/2014,1.0,"DO NOT.. AND I REPEAT DO NOT EAT HERE! This has to to be one of the WORST Bjs experiences that I have ever had in my entire life of eating at plenty Bjs in many different cities! I have never in my life felt so disrespected and just unwelcomed at any restaurant until now. Upon arriving we were seated and told we would be helped right away. Well our definition and their definition of ""right away"" clearly is different! The fact of the matter is they weren\'t even that busy.. I then had a question about happy hour and so the waitress said oh yeah it\'s in the bar area! No keep in mind prior to my party moving over to the bar area we were unaware of the fact that it\'s not offered on Saturdays! Why would the waitress tell us this before we moved over there and made a fool of ourselves asking for items off the happy hour menu? Things just went downhill from there because once we got another waitress about 15 minutes later she then comes over and takes our order and recommends the worse pizza ever! It came out so dry and barely and cheese or sauce! I wasn\'t going to pay for this $20 supposedly signature deep dish pizza that I couldn\'t bought in the frozen foods section ion and got an even better quality! Well once we decided we would like to switch the pizza our waitress was no where to be found and then we saw her walk over to what must be their ""clock out"" station with food in her hand ready to go home! Completely unprofessional because what most professional and accredited restaurants do is smoothly transition the new waiter or waitress to the customer. To add insult to injury my birthday happen to be this night and my friend communicated this to this waitress and do you think she cared enough to pass this information onto the next waiter? Absolutely not! Well this wasn\'t the case at all. Our new waiter Jeremy had to be one of the worse waiters I\'ve ever experienced too! He had a very nonchalant attitude about our complaints and when my friend got up to complain to the manger she seemed just as unsympathetic about the situation as her staff and that\'s exactly why I believe they behave the way they do because management itself just doesn\'t care! My advice is if your unhappy with your job then QUIT! Maybe somebody will read these reviews and actually care from the upper management or maybe we should get the corporate contact number and have them be aware of how this place is being ran because I\'m sure it\'s far from the standards that BJs implements for its staff! Completely disgusted!"
Diane C.,Brookings  OR,4,485,4,12/9/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,hubby ordered chili  which came out immediately. he said it was good  but not as good as the last time we were there.about 10 minutes later  my quesadilla and his side of fries were delivered. needless to say  we should have been served at the same time  and there was no reason for his chili to be served from the pot so early. my quesadilla was alright - mostly tortilla - with a a few pieces of cubed chicken. one of the quesadilla quarters had one small chunk of chicken. accompanying the quesadiilla was a very small bowl of black bean soup. i had to ask for a spoon - a bit difficult to eat with a long-tined fork.i had to ask for what seemed to me an obvious refill of a soda glass - lying empty at the table's edge. rodolfo was our server  friendly  easy to talk to  but had to be nudged for the refill.
V B.,Burlingame  CA,193,553,24,7/26/2013,4.0,"My first meal back and you want to eat at BJ\'s? I came in with low expectations but with an open mind and very empty stomach. And in the end I walked away with little nod of approval.BJ\'s is not pretending to be something it\'s not. If you want Gary Danko then go to Gary Danko. But if you want a place that 1. Has choices pizza to steak to ""I\'ll try the halibut"" 2. Comfortable casual setting with good bordering on great service. 3. Easy access right off 280 with miles of parking.Bingo Bango Bongo! The tri-fecta!So I have to ask  why the three star rating? The wine list doesn\'t include a vintage Burgundy? It\'s a beer place! If you want a dirty gin martini  sure you can get that (and actually they make a good one) but the beer list is attraction."
Adorable T.,Burlingame  CA,51,206,134,10/21/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"I didn\'t think this could happen  but I had an even worse experience than last time. The server was a sweet gentleman  but could not get the order right for half of the table. We came with a table of 9 around 7:45pm on a Sunday night to watch the game. The wait was about 45 minutes.I ordered the chicken club (recommended by the server) without mayo and with the bacon on the side (to share with my sister). Food came with mayo and with no bacon. I let the mayo slide although this could be a health request. Nevertheless  I reminded the server that I wanted the bacon on the side. Another person at my table did not get her correct order either.It was also my sister\'s bday  so we wanted to get a pizooki sampler (3 small pizookis). I asked him quietly on the side to present it with a candle to my sister sitting a few seats away from me on the other side of the table (which I pointed out). He comes back with one chocolate pizooki with a candle and asks me which person it goes to. Not the right order. Not longer a surprise. Not happy at this point.I mentioned to him that was not what I ordered  and he immediately put in the request for the pizooki. By that time  no one wanted to eat a pizooki anymore. Literally 2 minutes after I asked for the order to be cancelled. He ""asked his manager"" and couldn\'t cancel the order because they were in the process of making the platter.....................................Really? For someone who keeps on f\'ing up orders  the least you can do is to cancel this. No one wants to eat the mediocre food anymore.Get the pizooki  no one wants to eat it  asked for the check.Split the checks with 3 cards (the limit) and wrote the card names and totals at the top of the bill. He came back with some random totals for each card. Wth??? He also said one of the cards declined... which was weird  because it worked earlier for this person.Confused. When he I returned  I told him the totals were at the top and that he mischarged multiple credit cards.He apologized and went back to fix the mistake. This included running my friend\'s card again which went through fine.Service is a huge part of the dining out experience! I should not have to feel stressed or annoyed when I\'m eating out. Not sure what\'s up with the waiters here (or manager for not cancelling a pizooki order--seriously  it\'s worth $ and can be disposed of)  but I would not come again.Food is mediocre at best."
George S.,Vallejo  CA,9,60,2,10/10/2013,2.0,"Two stars is so misleading because the food is actually incredibly good. Came here late night with my girlfriend and ordered the shit outta all the appetizers which are surprisingly filling when you buy aLL OF THEM.But mostly I subtracted 3 stars for the poooooor pooor soo poor service. Front lady seemed like she didn\'t know where to put us  asking if we wanted to go to the bar even though there was like so many tables open literally like 5 x more tables open that we could have sat at then space available at the bar. But she spoke as if that wasn\'t an option. So we just sat at the table instead and let her know. And she just like .... decided not to inform any of the other waiters. So we sat there for a long time going unnoticed until I finally got annoyed enough to wave down a passing waiter who was just like ohh she\'ll handle you pointing to some other waitress. Then that waittress was just like I\'ll be right with you. And I was just like omg.I\'ve worked in food service before so I know how NOT HARD it is to give good service. You smile and attend to a customer ASAP andleave them with absolute confidence that someone will help them soon. Instead of just a bunch of ""I don\'t knows"" and passing down the service to another and another and another person.So step your shit up BJ\'s. Because next time I\'m here I\'m going to take lots of photos and videos of each of your waiters and waitresses and note names so that I have a clearer review next time I\'m annoyed."
Brent W.,South San Francisco  CA,1,5,,7/3/2015,5.0,This place was really busy and I assumed the service was going to be slow but luckily our server Miguel was extremely attentive and professional. The food was well prepared and brought out fast  the drinks were never empty. Great experience!
Sara N.,South San Francisco  CA,5,16,19,7/18/2013,3.0,This is just an easy go-to place for happy hour. The food isn't amazing  and the staff can be hit or miss. I've been lucky to get very good service the past few times I've been here. I think the drinks are over priced  but the food is better than similar chain restaurants. Love (4+ stars)1) BJ's Famous Pizookie - Really indulgent dessert that I love. Hot of the oven large chocolate chip cookie w/ vanilla bean ice cream. Can't go wrong with this one at all! 2) Pizookie Trio - Three small cookies topped w/ ice cream. You can choose between Chocolate Chunck  White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  Peanut Butter  Oatmeal Raisin Walnut  Cookies 'N Cream or Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli. Haven't tried the Oatmeal or the Cookies 'N Cream  but all the other flavors are great!Like (3 Stars)1) Great White Pizza - Deep dish pizza with Alfredo sauce with mushrooms  garlic  seasoned tomatoes  Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. I don't enjoy this pizza as much as the first time I ate it a couple years ago  but it's still a good go to. 2) Chicken Wontons (Thai style) - These are good small apps with a great Thair flavor. Nothing amazing...sometimes too oily  but they're a pretty safe bet.3) Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Nothing special  but they're still pretty good. They do get soggy  so eat them right away!4) Chicken Potstickers - Really good app  but over priced! I could honestly buy a bag of frozen Potstickers and make the same thing at home. But my gripe is w/ the price  not the taste of the dish.5) Boneless Chicken Wings (Maui Sweet Teriyaki Glaze) - very good and if you go at the right time they're part of the happy hour special. Great portion size  and great flavor. The glaze was a bit sweet and spicy. Defiantly a safe bet.6) Island Sunset  Tickled Pink  & Peechy Keen Snagria - They're all OK drinks  but nothing special at all.Pass (1 or 2 stars)1) Chicken Wontons (Buffalo style) - These are a hard pass...the flavor just is not there!2) Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms - These are small app that I thought were VERY bland.3) Avocado Egg Rolls - Really heavy and greasy. I can't say I dislike them all together  but I felt a bit sick after eating them they're so rich.4) Crispy Calamari - I should know better than to order calamari here...it was terrible. Not crispy at all  just chewy and really room temp. The lemon garlic aioli was so incredibly bland. Just BLAH all around. PASS on this one for sure!
James C.,San Francisco  CA,0,158,3,4/29/2015,2.0,Whenever I ate here  the staff looked tired and over-worked. As a result  the service was subpar. Don't be surprised if they mess your order up.
Valissa A.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,3,,5/28/2015,1.0,This service is ridiculous. I'm writing this as I'm sitting here. Its been 15 min since we've been waiting for a refill and our server has just been chatting away with the people at the next table. The steak was very dry even though we asked for medium. We will not be returning
Char N.,Portland  OR,27,15,1,3/10/2014,5.0,I love BJ's. It is what it is  which is a restaurant in a mall  so it is inevitably busy during rush hours and full of people I'd rather have nothing to do with  but for what it is  I adore it.I visit San Bruno frequently  and I eat at BJ's every time  because it is close to where I stay. And there are four great things going for this restaurant:-Despite being busy and having a large staff  a few members always recognize me and have a few words to say. (Chris is one waiter who always stops for a word  since I met him on his first shift.)-They have a large selection of good  imported beers  which I like  since I am a fan of Belgian-style beers--saisons and trips  etc.-Whenever they have been out of a bottled beer I have ordered  a manager comes to apologize and is more than eager to make sure I'm %110 happy.-The tortilla soup  oh my god  the tortilla soup. I could eat it every day and still crave it.Over all  this is a great place to eat  if you realize it is a high-volume  busy establishment during peak hours for lunch and dinner. I work in the industry so I get it and I am not annoyed when I have to wait  especially because the staff is seemingly so genuinely friendly  and will remember you and what you like.
Pablo J.,San Francisco  CA,34,36,,7/17/2015,5.0,Everything  from the appetizers to the main course was fresh and delicious. I tried the cherry glazed salmon and loved it. Nicky  our waitress  was excellent!
Sai K.,San Francisco  CA,5,21,3,6/26/2015,4.0,I went here like 5 times until now. I really love this place. very courteous staff. nice big menu. delicious food and the seating is really good. not too loud and not too calm. I like their drinks too. I always get the skinny rita
Jenny H.,San Francisco  CA,148,10,,8/4/2014,1.0,"Bad experience overall  nasty food and horrible service. My server was Delene. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta and it was soggy and too lemony. I asked my server if the pasta was supposed to be soggy and soft and she\'s like no it\'s supposed to be al dente and I told her it was not and she was like ""oh I\'m sorry"" and walked away. Never coming back here again!"
Jasmine M.,San Francisco  CA,11,1,,4/21/2015,2.0,Carlos sucks ass as a waiter and did from the beginning. It wasn't as busy for a Tuesday and he took long to bring our waters and walked around like he had a stick up his ass and gave me attitude when I asked him to bring us another bottle of ketchup. First of all  why would you bring an empty bottle of ketchup to a table? He lagged and was full of attitude. I was not happy with the service at all. Only left him $8 for a $120 bill. He didn't even deserve a tip. Do your job right dude and or at least fake it to get through your night. Food was good  service was awful. We even had to approach another waiter to bring us what we wanted because we needed to remind Carlos 3 times to do so.
Moss A.,Napa  CA,8,6,,5/20/2015,1.0,Hours later  I am still reeling from the pure chaos of this place. I won't even spend any energy explaining what happened  but from the many  many negative reviews I have read hear...stay away..stay far  far away.
Angie L.,San Bruno  CA,26,53,70,3/3/2015,4.0,Their food is great! And great place to meet your friends for Happy Hour! Only Con: They take no reservations  but you can call two hours in advance to be put on the waiting list  so when you get there you don't have to wait so long. Parking can be a nightmare here  only because it's part of Tanforan Mall...so if it's busy with weekend (or holiday) shoppers  parking can be kind of difficult.
Ellie D.,San Francisco  CA,9,39,2,7/20/2014,1.0,"If you\'re trying to place an order over the phone  calls are routed to a call center! Whoa! I learned this for the first time after I was placed on hold for 15 minutes by Jake from State Farm errrr BJs Call Center! Customer service at this location has been declining over the years - I\'ve had a number of not-so-great experiences here and it doesn\'t seem like management cares to up their game. While I did get a small apology from their manager  Brandy  it was more of a forced apology rather than a genuine one.So I\'m writing this review as I\'m waiting another 45 minutes on top of my promised pick-up time for my order and I\'m wondering what the hold up is to pop out 2 pizzas from the oven. There\'s another guy waiting next to me who\'s been waiting for over 30 minutes for his order  too. After 30 minutes  I overhear the staff saying there\'s a problem with my order  something about the cooks not seeing online orders on their end  so obviously that meant my order hadn\'t even been started yet at that point. I contemplated walking out but I had already stood there for over 30 minutes. If you read my other Yelp reviews  I\'m a very reasonable person. I don\'t write negative reviews just because an employee was rude or just because my food didn\'t come out as expected. But this review is a result of cumulative wtf experiences here. And management doesn\'t care to improve. If this was a dine-in order  there is absolutely no way someone would wait 45 minutes for a pizza. So it is absolutely unreasonable for a take-out order to take 1 hour for 2 pizzas when typically  as I was told  take-out orders are ready in 15 - 20 minutes. And although Brandy heavily discounted my order  she seemed hesitant to do so and quickly walked away after giving me my receipt without any explanation as to the reason for the long wait. My other experiences at this location were just as ridiculous. I remember a few years ago when I had a newborn and BJs just started brunch hours (10am I think?). My family and I were there right as they opened and I politely asked if I could be seated somewhere where I could keep my stroller next to me (as I had a baby sleeping inside)  and the server looked around the entire restaurant and said ... NO  sorry  we don\'t have any seats available where you can keep your stroller. What the?! I looked around the entire empty restaurant  as we were the first ones there at 10am  and explained that my newborn was sleeping and being that the restaurant was practically EMPTY  could we just sit in a corner or anywhere for a quick brunch as I had not been out of the house in months (newborn  remember) and she just looked confused and explained that strollers have to be stowed in the front and blah blah blah  I stopped listening and wanted to strangle this b*tch who did not understand how parents of newborns were lacking on sleep and super exhausted and how much effort it took just to get dressed and get a baby out of the house. Excuse the language  it was like de ja vu all over again. In the end  a manager came out and apologized profusely and explained the fire hazard with a stroller blocking a walkway  but offered to let us sit at any corner table or against the wall or somewhere in the back  and practically begged us to stay as we were getting ready to walk away  but I was too upset at that point. And there was this one time we sat and waited 30 minutes at a booth at the bar and the servers were pointing fingers at each other about who was supposed to be taking care of our table. And another time during lunch when we all ordered from the lunch menu or the soup/salad combo and were charged full meals for each item and the server said  ""Oh  I didn\'t realize you wanted a lunch portion."" But I clearly said  we were all ordering from the lunch menu. And then that started a train of confused servers who were bringing out our meals and then taking them back so that it was a smaller lunch portion. My favorite is when they bring you someone else\'s order and when you tell them that\'s not what you ordered  they get upset like it\'s our fault they\'re holding 3 dishes in their arms and they don\'t know where to go.The 1-star is for Vicki  who was incredibly professional handling take-out orders. I would actually give her 5 stars for the way she handled everything. Not once did she roll her eyes or even give me the slightest bit of attitude whenever I came up to ask her how much longer my order would be. She was calm and apologetic  and told me she completely understood why I was so frustrated. She seemed more pulled together than their manager and the other employees. This was probably an off night for take-out orders because I watched her apologize to every single person for the delay with their take-out order  but nevertheless  she was professional. I\'m glad to see people like her at the front lines handling all that stress."
Jackie M.,San Bruno  CA,0,21,,7/9/2015,4.0,Love the food  love the drinks  love the fire pit and happy hour. Not giving 5 stars because for some god awful reason the women's bathroom has stunk like a sewer for months. I cannot breath at times. Probably not their fault and haven't gone in a month. Hopefully its better.
V L.,San Francisco  CA,213,27,12,3/20/2014,1.0,First time experience at BJThis is not really an impressive experience. The service is extremely slow and somethings they will even forget you was sitting there waiting for the plate. Secondly  the food was just ok. They are over the salty side a little (it may be great for drunky). The salad that I ordered have way too many toritos chip instead of lettuce. It made me wonder am I really eating salad or what. The soda that you can get there is like water  totally not carbonated.
Tom A.,Amarillo  TX,0,6,,2/1/2016,1.0,I usually don't do reviews  but this place deserves it. Sat right next to the bar  still had to wait 20 minutes for a beer  while watching others around me get served. Waited almost an hour for dinner  just a burger & salad. It came out in 3 deliveries  forgot the fries  forgot the salad  the burger had been sitting a long time waiting to be brought out  so it was cold & obviously just slapped together. If the food was worth waiting for  that's one thing. But between being ignored & bad food & service  no more bj for me. There's plenty of other decent places to go.
Tiffany C.,San Francisco  CA,297,304,306,1/3/2012,4.0,I came here a couple of time and usually there is a wait. Most times the wait isnt too bad. However  the last time I came here  it was Monday nightfoot ball. This place is crazy. We made reservations for 6:30 but didnt get seated till 8! Super crazy  but I feel that for football fans its a great place. Everyone cheers when something good happens and yells when something bad happens. Its very spirited and my friends loved it! But personally I just wanted dinner. They have TVs everywhere and I am sure that from every booth anyone can get a good view. I love the deep dish pizza  esp the great white but this time I tried something different. I tried one of the low calories dish and to my surprise it was super delicious too! I forgot the name to the dish but it had grilled fish with rice. I will definitely come back but probably no on a Monday night.
Shaufaye Y.,Cupertino  CA,15,22,30,10/28/2013,1.0,Use the google offer to have brunch here  the weekend brunch is good deal  but taste just okay.The server is rude  took away my iPhone when I show her the offer.Feel not good about the service.
Soul G.,San Bruno  CA,8,23,,5/10/2014,1.0,"This BJ is the worst I have ever had and I have never had a bad one in my entire life!!If you don\'t care about service  ambiance  hot food or your precious time that is constantly leaking from its unknown reservoir  this is the eatery for you! When I walked in the music was shouting out of the speakers  fighting for attention with the hockey game and it\'s witty announcers. As I was speaking with the hostess she seemed to be slowly falling asleep so I tapped the counter to wake her up. After some tapping she came around and gave me a buzzer which would notify me when my table was ready for my lovely bride and I to feast on some BJ pizza pie!!45 minutes later we were seated  10 minutes later our waiter came by  he was completely stoned on some of Northern California\'s finest marijuana  we ordered two cocktails which we never received. During our time at the table  we were offered several different dishes that we did not order because we had not ordered yet !Our waiter came by and asked us if there was anything else we needed  I started laughing so hard I almost woke up the hostess! After he took our order he came by and informed us he was leaving and that another waiter would be waiting on us. Turns out we were the ones waiting.Food came out wrong  cold and long after my hunger pangs left me lost in the glow of shit pop music and dim witted unkempt servers.We left and walked across El Camino Real to Jack\'s restaurant where the nightmare pressed on. ""Once more into the breech dear friends"""
Erica M.,San Francisco  CA,63,5,14,4/10/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I just checked my reward account. Apparently  Aakash didn't even credit my visit onto my reward card. But  I figured how to add my points manually on their web page.
Briana M.,San Francisco  CA,2,8,,12/29/2015,1.0,Terrible. Worst Service I've ever had. Our waitress was not attentive at all and gave me attitude when I asked for another salad ( I ordered unlimited soup and salad). The only plus is the $3.95 beer happy hour.
Nobu K.,San Francisco  CA,1537,966,45,4/23/2013,2.0,Jim Bean Bourbon Burger  at Carl's Jr. 6 bucks.That's the most great deceptive advertising burger ever as we all know.It just doesn't look like the TV ad  at all.I think Carl's Jr. always does that deceptive TV advertising using fashion model to fool guys around. A guy like myself. I am a fool.I really wanted to get the Bourbon Burger  at Carl's Jr. And I did the other day.It was a creepy bad disgusting burger ever had.I believe it was soy-sause mixed w/ high fructose corn syrup plus msg for kick  and calling Bourbon Burger.False Advertising.But  if  you are having a burger is not better than that  that'll be a problem.I had a bacon Cheese burger at BJ's. I was with my friends. My friends like BJ's. I think because those TVs on the wall. I have been avoiding coming here so many times with them but I could not say No to this time.I just did not like the hamburger  OK?The burger patty was dry  not moist at all. It was cold  I hate eating cold burger. I am very sure that my burger was sitting in the kitchen for a while because the place is really big. That is very hard for all wait-staff. We were sitting near by the kitchen so I have heard the commotions from the kitchen and waiters hit the door very hard and came out.That's not good sign seeing and making a bit curious possibly a fight between kitchen staff and waiter  no matter what.All kitchen-staff in any restaurants in California are basically own by Mexicans  right?It's pretty rough in there if you don't speak Spanish. They will tear you down. They'll talk bad behind you back.We all do  don't we? California kitchens are all rough world.But  they should keep their problem more quietly in the kitchen. I felt bad for the waitstaff because our waitress was good.They must have a bigass kitchen  many people working really hard  but a big restaurant like this  I don not know how to manage people  how to control orders and who gets 1st  and what not. So  I do feel sorry giving the place 2 star. But  Hey  my hamburger was not that good. Bourbon Burger at Carl's jr.is better.So  I still try to avoid the place.I hate my friends  sometimes.
Vilma C.,San Francisco  CA,21,21,10,8/14/2014,1.0,"I really hope that the management is reading this... I went to Bjs yesterday dinner time around 6:15 Wednesday aug 13 and the hostess who helped us was ok  she quoted us 20-30 mins so we waited. After 45 mins of waiting I checked up on how longer was going to be  she told us we were next and three parties went ahead of us. I was patient so they finally seat us. Moving on  the waitress who served us was TERRIBLE! We had to wait over 40 mins for our food and when we finally got our food my party and I had to ask for napkins and silverware! They never refilled our waters and when I asked one of the runner guys if I can have hot salsa  joking he told ""NO"" now I wanted to go nuts on his ass but i remain on my seat. I didn\'t tip for crap! Bad service and I recommend everyone to go somewhere ELSE!!! Do not waste your money or time!!! And who ever is the CEO I will recommend to fire the management cause it obviously isn\'t teaching the servers any customer service skills! Thank you!"
Chris T.,San Francisco  CA,320,53,14,11/3/2013,1.0,"I took my son here for what I hoped would be a fun ""guy\'s night"" dinner where we could watch some college football together.We got there a bit before the rush. It was busy  but since we were only two people  we were seated quickly. Most groups waiting and that were already seated seemed to be 6+. I overheard the manager telling someone who had walked in with a party of 10 that their wait could be 2 hours. So keep that in mind.The food is that kind of perfectly chewable  extremely-loaded-with-calories-and-salt lab-created food that large chain mall restaurants have. It\'s good because it\'s engineered that way. I had a french dip that had the most bizarre au jus I\'ve ever tasted -- it was like teriyaki  but not.The server sized us up as being a cheap bill immediately and behaved that way. He asked us if we wanted to order right after being handed the menu  and if I wanted dessert with my mouth full of my entree. Anything that could have gotten us out of there faster would have made him ecstatic. He also had rehearsed jokes (""I\'ll have a french dip"" .. ""he just left!"") and kept nudging me on the shoulder when he wanted to say something to me.The other thing is  along with the menu  he presented me with a frequent diner card form and said I should fill it out. Throughout the meal  he kept trying to upsell me this stupid frequent diner card  saying things to my son like ""Dad let you use that pen instead of filling out the card"".Now  whoever at Corporate HQ thinks that pushing these frequent diner cards are a good idea needs to have their head checked. It\'s terribly annoying for customers and I can\'t imagine the upside is worth annoying a potential return customer with the hard upsell. If servers are incentivized to push this thing  seriously  stop it.We contemplated dessert but our waiter started paying more attention to the table of 10 that walked in next to us. So my son and I had the highlight our of meal  which was sharing a dip code at the nearby DQ. I recommend going there instead."
Natalia K.,San Francisco  CA,423,181,52,9/24/2014,3.0,"I love BJ\'s Restaurants for their consistently great food and outstanding brews. Also  they have great lunch specials that are a total deal  like the unlimited soup and salad for only $7.95 (you can change up the soup and salad with each order). For the beers the Jeremiah Red is my favorite  as is the Berryburst Cider (also good as a half and half ""JerryBurst""). My only complaint is that the service here is SO slow. Everyone is friendly  but I every time I have come to this location I have had to wait extremely long for the food to arrive. One time it took 55 minutes after ordering my meal at lunch time to receive my food  and my sandwich was cold while my friend\'s food was hot. This location obviously needs more food runners or something because waiting 20+ min to receive any food (such as apps) is just too long at lunchtime."
Jay H.,Florence  KY,245,235,168,1/23/2012,3.0,BJ  Not to bad for a chain food restaurant Brewery. Good place to watch the 49's vs the Giants in the play off 2012 I first order there light draft beer. Not to bad of a taste. We order the sampler it had 4 avocado rolls were very good. Would order this again. The spring rolls and the cheese sticks were OK. Artichoke dip with chips was also OK. Next time I would only order the avocado rolls. The main part of the meal was really good. The cheese burger Pizza. Never ever had that. The crust was really good topping had pickles on it and ground beef peppers onions.Overall above average for a chain brewery. Would go there again to watch one football. Like the atmosphere.
LuLu M.,San Jose  CA,555,505,107,10/27/2013,5.0,I don't remember much about the food to be honest with you  but I do remember getting the best service I've had in years - not just good  but over and above what this guy was required to do and it made our day to be served by him. So Derrick  in the bar  thank you again for the stellar service. I hope you enjoyed the big tip and that we pulled the manager aside to let him know you deserved a raise and promotion! And just kidding  the Asian sesame salad was delicious by the way!
Mike L.,El Granada  CA,610,110,,8/6/2015,1.0,Service could be a bit faster. Need more servers especially the one that served us  made it seem he didn't want to be here. Now food is good and cocktails. Servers being at lunch at too late of an hour. Entrees came out in time. The server also said they only have one bartender is clueless. They should hire a second bartender inexcusable. Repeating the menu over and over again. Like he's not paying any attention to us. Poor quality service. Now Shay provided excellent service by checking in with her staff now that's a good person to have as a staff person. Dessert Poozookie Oreo Cookie outright deserves this as a 5 star dessert.
Lori L.,San Bruno  CA,7,1,,1/21/2016,4.0,I had a great server named Monica. Beautiful  friendly and attentive. Greeted us with a nice smile and all of our orders were timely. Food was good but service was excellent for the first time in a very long time. Thank you Monica
Mike G.,South San Francisco  CA,0,5,,1/21/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"In May of last year We experienced some rather poor service and issues with our food. At that time the then manager  reached out to us and we noticed that on our next visits things had improved greatly. Although the service continues to be below par  the food is almost always what we expect. This past weekend  We ventured to BJ\'s for lunch before a movie. Walked in  got seated immediately  server quick to the table to take our drink order. Took about 10 minutes to get two beers  which is about the average wait time for drinks there. Ordered our appetizers  the chicken wings with parmesian sauce. Waiter looks at me and says ""how would you like them""? After explaining again  he leaves. Appetizer comes  but wait! No plates  no napkins no utensils. We had to ask for them after we have been at the table for almost 20 minutes. Our food order came in a nice amount of time  but wait  my burger which says it comes with ""special burger sauce"" alas had no sauce!! This is the second time I\'ve ordered the same burger and no sauce!! When I asked about the sauce the waiter said ""Oh do you want some""? Long and short service was about 2.5 out of five  food 3 out of 5  over all I\'ve noticed that the servers don\'t seem to know the menu  they are slow  lots of mangers walking around  but appearing not to notice things. This is stuff we noticed in the past. Also seems to be a high turnover rate of servers and managers. We probably won\'t be back for awhile  just isn\'t worth the aggrevation."
Jo S.,San Francisco  CA,43,168,3,6/27/2013,4.0,PAZOOKIE PAZOOKIE PAZOOKIE!!! Who can resist a warm cookie top with ice cream. Soooo GOOD!!!! You can order a personal size or a party size to share.Food is good also. Service is a hit or miss.
Briana W.,Oakland  CA,111,241,93,9/12/2014,3.0,Food was good! Sat in the bar area to avoid waiting 30 min for a table. It was pretty packed because there was a baseball game on. Our waiter was not very attentive  and noticed other waiters having problems too. Anyways I ordered the bacon cheese burger and it was delicious. I had the house Cabernet and in retrospect should of ordered a beer to go with my meal. My colleague wasn't happy with the service at all. The guy was young and could tell was a little distracted. Oh well  still enjoyed my meal.
Lila S.,Daly City  CA,0,16,,5/17/2015,5.0,My husband and I came here for dinner last night and it was great. Al was our waiter and he provided us with outstanding service. He is personable  charismatic and attentive. He has a great sense of humor and is the type of waiter that makes you want to come back. Thanks again Al we will see you soon!
Chris D.,Spokane  WA,29,164,31,10/31/2013,4.0,Came here for happy hour at the bar and service was excellent. The food and drinks were super cheap and still really good. I liked the multiple screen tv in front of the bar so I could watch 4 things at once. At shift change the second bartender wasn't nearly as attentive  otherwise I'd have given this place 5 stars which is something I just don't do with chains restaurants.
Ayana K.,San Francisco  CA,546,244,65,8/19/2013,3.0,Late Night Drinks and food with the BF. WE got 2 Wildberry Mojito's which were really good. Our server also threw in a Watermelon Mojito which was even better. Angus Sliders w/ cheddar cheese & bacon...TastyChicken Pot Stickers... I've had betterBoneless Wings... kinda bland..Balsamic glazed chicken... Tasty
A b.,San Francisco  CA,366,31,249,3/18/2013,3.0,I can only give this place 3 stars. Everytime I come with my best gf for a catchup sess  its great. Everything is great  no complaints.Everytime I come with my bf  they mess up his order! every single time!Hit or miss!
Anthony D.,Granite Bay  CA,0,4,,5/27/2015,5.0,Liked the pizookie! Waited a little longer for our food. Server is attentive & courteous
Larry D.,Isla Vista  CA,4,7,1,8/14/2014,1.0,We must be invisible because our server never gave us any service. What a waste of fucking time. Oh and the food is salty.
Rebecca M.,San Francisco  CA,12,52,16,12/21/2014,3.0,Watched part of the niner game at Bj's last night. they seem to always be pretty busy but I got a seat at the bar section right away. Ordered chicken wings I bit into one and it was ice cold in the middle. Told the server and they replaced it  thankfully I did not get sick. I ordered chicken tortilla soup and wedge salad combo both were very good. My boyfriends steak was also good. Atmosphere is nice.
Lisandro E.,San Francisco  CA,25,6,,12/7/2015,5.0,It's been a while since I came here. I had 3 friends with me and got a table in cocktail  food and drinks were good  Camilla took great care of us!! Good crowd  very attentive  quick on her feet  beautiful smile great energy!!! Gotta love Bjs  will be back!!!
Julian B.,Belmont  CA,3,39,5,5/20/2015,5.0,This place has really good food. All of there dishes are really on point. Especially the deep dish pizza. You just can't find to many restaurants like this anymore. Awesome awesome.
Larry L.,Oakland  CA,36,144,17,7/28/2014,3.0,Convenient place to go to for happy hour. The food selection for HH is limited but I won't go hungry at least. Clean place. Service is on the slow side.
Stephanie B.,San Francisco  CA,1,12,,11/22/2015,1.0,this location has VERY POOR management and hostess that cannot read or hostess that have a sense of time we waited 2 hours for a table an hour for food and they melted our ice cream cake because the hostess put it in the cooler. idiots
Rhonda D.,Roseville  CA,0,17,,6/19/2016,3.0,We went here for lunch before taking our Paris friends to the airport for their return to France  and it was opening day of Euro Cup 2016 which they did not want to miss. We called ahead to see if they would be playing the game and they told us just to ask and they would make sure it was playing when we came. We arrived and sat in the bar  and the manager worked quickly to not only have it playing  but had it on the huge screen as well as 2 additional screens! Fantastic! For this part we were thrilled. Now  the food is always fairly good at BJ's but at this location we had the same problem as at our local one in Roseville  CA. - sloooow service. It took forever to get our food. The server was very nice and seemed experienced so it wasn't his fault - probably the kitchen. Each time we go - which is fewer and farther between - the service is the same. What's the problem BJ? Get it together! No excuse. Hire more cooks! You make us stay away and we eat out a lot!
Jerome B.,Alexandria  VA,43,89,11,7/27/2013,1.0,Good god! This when I was here with my wife  I was immediately assaulted with the reek of weed. And although I try to be pretty accepting of today's youth - this place was over-ridden with a bunch of young gang bangers (infested seemed too strong a word  yet strangely appropriate).  To top it off - the service here sucked  and the drinks are suspect (would suspect that if inspectors came with a hydrometer - they would lose their licence). Been to other BJs - was expecting at least a standard equal to those... but this place seemed hell bent on lowering the bar. Kudos team - mission accomplished.
Jana L.,Millbrae  CA,1,10,,4/21/2015,2.0,Waited 1/2 hour before food was served.and they didn't get us out appetizer. One dinner did not get the avocado as requested. Had to ask for water a lot. Waiter seems very new and apologized for the kitchen forgetting the order. But the bacon burger was good. Mediterranean taco was good.Fish n chips at good.Just the wait and perfection of the dishes and orders need wotk
Bryce M.,Newport Beach  CA,49,108,20,10/13/2013,2.0,I've been to three BJ's locations in California  and this one definitely comes in at the bottom spot. As someone who has worked in a customer service role (and knows what a pain it can be)  it's not very hard to impress me. All I want is your attention for a brief moment  a greeting of any kind  and a thank you. Unfortunately  the girls at the front desk failed miserably on the greeting and attention front. There was no real greeting  and they seemed to be more interested in their own conversation. Blah.....Our waiter  whose name I don't remember  was adequate. He was knowledgeable  friendly  and relatively attentive. I would give him 4 stars.Okay  now comes the most important part  the food. The soup  Tomato Bisque  was excellent. I'd recommend asking for crackers to add as well. That would be the saving grace for me return to this location. The salad  however  was terrible. The lettuce was wilted  there was hardly any dressing (I couldn't even see any)  and there was no croutons on my cesar salad (lol!).Overall  it was a less than ideal experience. I may even be able to look past the bad salad if the customer service was excellent from start to finish. The girl at the check in desk was just really bad.
Joyce E.,Daly City  CA,135,1018,2084,2/27/2012,4.0,I really don't have anything to complain about except the wait! The wait usually averages to be about 1 hour-1.5 hours depending on the time  day  and amount of people in your party. Good food  decent prices  amazing service  and amazing rootbeer and pizzookies! Definitely better than the Cheesecake Factory! P.S.Our last waiter was Samir and he was awesome despite the amount of tables he had to serve that night. Excellent service!
Mat T.,Daly City  CA,0,6,,8/30/2014,1.0,The outside of this restaurant looks very promising however the food is below average  IN-and-Out is 5x better. Sucks..
Cathy N.,San Francisco  CA,99,93,32,12/4/2014,3.0,Their food is average. Nothing to die for. I only come here when I'm at the mall and have absolutely no where else to eat. Their pizzas are pretty good though and the only thing i'm really obsessed with is their pizookie.
Jim Chris U.,San Mateo  CA,124,61,51,4/22/2011,5.0,Had ma 21st bday here with ma crew.The Server was really nice!The ambience was awesome!The food was Great! i got the jambalaya special! Moi Caliente!!!The Beer was Goooood! piranha!The Free Dessert was delicious! ohm!!!Very satisfied! and had a good laugh cuz ma friend kept makin green jokes about the restaurants name LMAOAwesome place! definitely gonna come back
Frances A.,San Francisco  CA,28,10,4,3/12/2015,1.0,I'm so fed up with Bjs service. I'm never one to complain but tonight just tops it. Server was in such a hurry. Took our orders  and left. Entrees came before appetizer. Waiter/server never came back to check on us nor refill our drinks. He was checking out every single table around us  but us! Are you kidding me? I literally had to ask the hostess for out check! Seriously don't think of ever coming back because of tonight!
Jason S.,South San Francisco  CA,54,79,18,3/17/2013,2.0,Wa-womp- I went here with some work friends. even though we mentioned to our server that we had a movie to catch in 1hr  the pizza I ordered didn't get to me until 45 min after I ordered. After we paid the bill. The lesson here is to not go to BJ's if you are in a rush. Which is a shame since it is so close to sfo and is walking distance to a movie theatre.It wasn't a total loss. The server let us have happy hour prices for beer and mini pizzas (aka the one I didn't get until after we paid) even though we were there at 11am and the happy hour menu clearly stated the first wave for discounts was at 3pm. Plus the guy was nice. By the way the server apologized for the pizza coming in late. The reason was because my mini pizza went to another table somehow and they had to cook (reheat?? idk!) a new one in the kitchen for me...In any case I may find myself coming here more anyway since we do a lot of shift dinners from here and I'm a sucker for their pizzas no matter how crap the punctuality and prioritization of the general service is.
Frank B.,Bay Area  CA,0,14,,4/23/2013,1.0,Service at the front of the house was amateur.Server was friendly  but food took nearly an hour to arrive. Food was expensive and mediocre.Our entire family became violently ill directly after eating here. First time catching a foodborne illness. Terrible!
Kevin L.,Sunnyvale  CA,2,11,,8/26/2014,1.0,"I walked in myself into the bar yesterday around 4:00 intending to order a few of their happy hour specials. I sat there for more than 10 minutes without anyone so much as saying a word to me. No ""Hi  I\'ll be with you in a second"" or not even a ""Hello"". I walked out trying to figure out why no one greeted me. Was it because I was dressed in a suit? Did I intimidate the staff too much? Was it because I smelled? Because I remember taking a shower. Was it because I was by myself and maybe I looked like I wasn\'t going to order a lot of food? Whatever the reason  if you don\'t want my business  I was glad to take my money elsewhere  thank you very much."
Vanessa K.,East Bay  CA,131,997,469,10/8/2011,1.0,HORRIBLE!!! I've never had a bad experience with any BJ's  with the exception of this location. I shall NEVER return:-food is COLD-pizza is doughy  and did not cook long enough in the oven-waiter spilled water all over us  and all we got was a simple apology-chicken fried steak was cold and dryAll of it was atrocious. Worse $78 meal ever.
Tara T.,San Pablo  CA,107,48,31,1/8/2015,5.0,Went here with co workers   we had a new server tyler. He was awesome the food was great I also had the macaroni and cheese it was so good . Tyler was great he kept making sure we all had what we needed  and was super patient when all 17 of us has to split the bill ! Thanks for the great service tyler !
Maria S.,Brisbane  CA,359,622,1893,10/1/2011,3.0,Places like BJ's makes me feel old. Ok  I am old  but that's besides the point. Probably if I was 10-15 years younger I would love hanging out here with friends after work or on the weekend to share some brews and appetizers while catching games on the multiple flatscreens throughout the place. But alas  (do only old people use the word alas?) I come here rarely when the family needs a bite to eat and we can't decide on anywhere else. For me  it's your standard menu  thought I do like the mini appetizers and can just order a bunch of those to nosh on. The place is definitely loud  which again  reminds me that I'm old and too sensitive to grey noise now. Service is ok  nothing over the top and nothing that would piss me off  so that's a good thing. Only caution I would give on going here is that their service for large groups can be slow if you aren't doing a buffet thing. I've gone with co-workers here for lunch a few times and each one had us late getting back. If it's a small group  then you should be fine. Cheers!
Rob G.,San Diego  CA,3,7,,12/10/2015,1.0,We ordered a pizooki for takeout. The guy took my name and said it would be 10 minutes. I sat down right in front of him. Twenty five minutes later  I ask him what happened and he says wait a minute and takes the pizooki out of the refrigerator and hands it to me. HORRIBLE SERVICE. No apology either.
Catheria S.,San Francisco  CA,240,65,8,6/11/2013,1.0,Came here for my birthday to get the free pizookie (no shame).We sat in the bar for the happy hour menu. The drinks took 10 minutes to arrive and the HH food (such small portions they may as well be appetizers) took 45 minutes to reach our table.Oh  and the angus sliders plate looked cluttered with random scraps of lettuce falling off the edge of the plate.Not to mention another 20 minutes for the check.Lunch ended up being 2 hours long. Luckily for Steven the server  it was my birthday so I wasn't in a complaining mood.
M D.,San Francisco  CA,11,91,976,6/18/2011,3.0,If you can get a seat at the bar  the Happy Hour selection and deals are great. A lot of groups meet here for all occasions. TVs all around which makes watching sports even better.I do love their food and the huge selection. Same goes for cocktails  beers and desserts.The service is iffy  I've gotten both excellent and crappy service as many times as I've been here. I can't stand the wait for a table though  it's always longer than what they tell you!
Megan R.,San Francisco  CA,7,22,1,7/9/2014,3.0,Come here for lunch  and while the food is okay it's an awesome bar to watch sports in! Tons of TV's you can see from almost anywhere! Just wish they had more of La Liga or the Premier League playing...
Jessica H.,Healdsburg  CA,1,11,6,2/24/2015,2.0,Went here today for my son's birthday and it was not good. The appetizers were the best thing we had oh and the water...lol. My house steak was burnt the broccoli was dry and my soup was cold. My son enjoyed his jalapeo burger. The waiter was very rude and unprofessional. Kept calling me lady...smh. We asked for a glass of water with no ice and was given a cup of HOT WATER!!! Probably won't return again for dinner only appetizers...oh forgot to add the strawberry mojito was GROSS!!!!!
Shaft S.,San Francisco  CA,46,7,,1/24/2015,1.0,"My wife and I were having repairs done on our car at Sears and walked over to BJs for lunch. While the menu posted outside suggested above-average bar food  our overall experience was awful. I hate writing that  but my wife and I want to make sure people know what this place is like. We walked in and the hostess doesn\'t talk to us  picks up two menus  and as she is walking into the dining area says ""oh  if you want to sit in the bar it\'s open seating."" Based on her surliness  we chose to sit in the bar. We sat in the bar  were given menus  and introduced to our waitstaff rapidly. They took our drink orders promptly and came back shortly thereafter to get our food orders. We ordered the buffalo chicken wings for an appetizer  and my wife chose the Barbecue Chicken Chop Salad while I had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich.  20-25 minutes later our food came out. By ""our food"" I mean a salad without dressing and a cold beef sandwich. I am sure you are wondering about the chicken wings... So were we! We were half way through our lunch 15 minutes in) when a waitstaff (not our waiter) brings out the chicken wings. I sent them back and asked they be taken off our bill  but not before seeing a plate of what looked to be chicken pieces from birds ravaged by tuberculosis. In the long run  we are healthier for not getting them.When our waiter finally came back to our table  about 30 minutes after the last time he came by  he apologized for the wings and we asked him for some salad dressing. He comes back several minutes later to crack jokes and let us know the chicken was taken off the bill  but forgot the salad dressing. The kicker of the meal - before we could give our waiter feedback on our crappy experience HE WENT ON LUNCH BREAK! We were passed to another waiter who also avoided our table for another 20 minutes. My wife and I do not openly complain about things  but this experience was the worst we have ever had in a restaurant and we will not be going back to this establishment"
Tim F.,Millbrae  CA,5,53,,2/20/2015,4.0,Located inside Tanforan  this is a really convenient BJs as there's always a wait  but at least there's a mall to walk around. The food is typical Pub food and I like the pizzas. Wings are great too
Carla F.,Millbrae  CA,491,344,915,2/14/2011,4.0,I love coming to BJ's  when I am craving a good hearty meal. The meatloaf is off the hook  I wouldn't say its better than mine but for sure it's good. The flavors are all there and the mash potatoes compliment the meat loaf. I've also had the New York Steak with a loaded baked potato  this is by far my favorite!! You must come with a big appetite cause the steak is a good size and the baked potato it's huge (especially with all the fixings!). I love their potato skins!! I love all their beer except for the Totonka!! Too Dark for me but my husband loves it!!!
Rick M.,Chicago  IL,0,24,,5/17/2014,2.0,We ordered soup and a pizza. The soup was pretty good but the pizza was not much better than a frozen pizza. The Goliath IPA beer was very good. The service was very poor. Inattentive and unfriendly.
Jansine G.,San Francisco  CA,106,6,3,11/3/2015,3.0,Service is sooooo bad at night! It isn't even that busy but they take forever to serve. I'm usually just here for the drinks because food is ok.
DJ Nocturna R.,Honolulu  HI,1132,168,540,7/14/2014,1.0,Im sorry I have to be blunt. I will never go here again. It's was my first and my last. The service was terrible. My food was very late  I got no apology or explanation and they charged us for it. The food was not even good. For a big party  you need more than one waiter. If it wasn't for the great company  I would have complained.
B W.,Chicago  IL,7,14,7,2/8/2014,4.0,Ok so Saturday night at 1900 is sorta a dumb time to come but they got us in quickly  the waiter (although SUPER busy) was quick and personable!My wife and I shared the chicken bacon flatbread appetizer and it was PLENTY for the entire meal for both of us!! With leftovers!The hard cider was pleasant and the people watching... Fantastic!!
Bobbie B.,San Jose  CA,0,52,,1/7/2015,3.0,I expected to not like this chain restaurant with a massive menu but actually the unlimited soup and salad at lunch was quite good. The four soups on the menu were well-prepared with good flavor accents  not over salted  and served hot. The four different salads were also well-prepared with fresh and crisp greens and good dressing. The price was excellent. There were service problems though. The food took too long  the appetizers were served after the entree. Idle wait staff ignored requests for silverware (yes a basic fork) and water. Although the restaurant was only 1/2 full they seated our party of 5 large adults in a too small booth. our waiter though was friendly and helpful but just overworked.
Paulette A.,San Francisco  CA,1,5,,1/7/2015,1.0,Worst BJ's I've been to. Had us wait half an hr+ to be seated then forgot our reservation. Food was cold/ half cooked. They forgot to order half our order. Then tried to compensate with a dessert. REALLY?! At least the last waitress was nice.
Jesse S.,Daly City  CA,256,341,456,3/28/2013,2.0,For a mall place during lunch time. The service should have been better. seated in a couple of minutes  (Lot's of open tables and servers present ). Ordered   appetizer came. ate all of it  food came out slow   table next to up seated after us got their food first. Didn't order anything special. food came out warm. So  if you can the food court is better.
Dave S.,Sunnyvale  CA,1,124,4,3/14/2013,2.0,We stopped by here last Sunday for a quick lunch on our way up to the city  and were not impressed. We all decided on different versions of the pizza and salad combo  and while they were tasty  there were only about 9 bites worth of pizza (and those would have been small bites). The prices seemed really high for such small servings  but I guess they do have to pay their massive staff. I didn't count them  but it seemed like they had waaayyyy too many people waiting on the customers (the place was only about 20% full). The staff was attentive- too attentive- they kept asking if we wanted drink refills  even when the glasses weren't even half empty.One last note to the wait staff- if you want to tell your co-workers about the itchy red blotches and pimples on your legs  please do it somewhere besides the dining room...  Yeah  we heard the whole story!I won't be going back.
Kevin C.,Hingham  MA,10,45,,11/14/2013,2.0,I heard this chain was good and thought I'd check it out for lunch. Boy was I disappointed. I wanted to eat somewhat light  so I didn't go with the pizza or burger  which was probably my mistake. That's their signature items. They have a large menu  which is a big mistake for a chain like this I think. They should stick to what they do well.I got a side salad....it was mostly white iceberg lettuce  very little green  and what was green was very light green. Then the shrimp tacos. The tacos were decent  but it came with tortilla chips  a small ramekin of salsa and one of a creamy avacado sauce. Well the chips were greasy  which was unappetizing. We all know chips are made by deep frying but they don't usually come out and stay shiny and wet with grease. Then the ramekins were so small  you couldn't dip your chip into the salsa or sauce. That defeats the use of chips. Just dumb decision by the restaurant. Service was good (I ate at the bar). I didn't try the beer  but maybe that would be their saving grace.
Nathan H.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,3/4/2015,1.0,Got the bbq bison burger. Incredibly shitty. Came late  asked for medium rare came back very well done. Bunch of 'Cole slaw' on the side which was really just chopped up cabbage. Just generally a horrible meal.
Gary B.,San Antonio  TX,5,5,,12/30/2014,2.0,I don't know why service was terrible tonight but it was. Could've been the cooks  the waiters' forgetfulness or the amount of customers.
Lisa N.,San Francisco  CA,39,454,50,4/25/2013,2.0,bartender was ridiculously rude. waitress seemed overwhelmed. she had to be flagged down several times for the same things. what is alll the rave about? pizookie is just a flat brownie?! what the hellFor some reason I was under the impression that a pizookie was some sort of amazing dessert. (when we got it  i was so disappointed when I realized I could easily make it myself. -_-)perhaps I'll come back for happy hour  seems then is when its more worth it.
Alicia W.,Daly City  CA,1,23,24,4/15/2014,1.0,Worst place ever came here at 11:00pm no one wanna serve us bad customer service if I can give zero star ill give them zero people who work here r rude sit down for 10min not even a cup of water or menu we have to wave at the server to ask them if we could have a menu!!! After we got the menu the server said he will b right back 10 min pass no one came back we have to look for our server I guess they r in a rush to get off work and don't wanna serve..the manager here really need to retain all their staff....this is the worst customer service restaurant I ever been too and I would never come back for sure
Eric L.,Daly City  CA,1,19,,4/14/2014,1.0,"First of all if you have any hopes of getting seated inside be prepared to have to wait 45+ minutes just to be seated. On this occasion we were forced to sit outside on the patio. Upon sitting down on this chilly day  we realized the outdoor heaters were not turned on so we asked our waitress if she could turn them on for us & she quickly mentioned she would get her manager. This alone struck me off guard since she worked there and should know how to function the heaters on her own for the customers. I did not want to make a scene to require the manager to personally attend to us for something that could have and should have been done by the server. After finally getting our heater fixed  we ordered our drinks & either the waitress was new or didn\'t know her stuff but she kept telling us certain things were not on the happy hour menu when we were reading right off of it. I know it may be a lot to remember but certainly something that should be able to grasp after a while. STRIKE 1After finally ordering our drinks  we had to wait a solid 10-15 minutes before getting them served to us which was horrible. The foam on my beer was gone and the evaporation on the glass showed that my beer had been poured a while ago & was sitting on the counter not being delivered to us. Upon receiving my beer  I noticed a little spec of dirt near the top which I had to fork out. At this point  I was pretty dissatisfied but still determined to make this a good experience for my girlfriend & I so I ignored it & drank the beer anyways. I took a sip of the beer and thanks to the combination of the horrible pour by the bartender and the slow delivery by the server  one small sip equated to nearly an inch of the beer in my glass gone! Ridiculous! It seemed that the servers there were all inexperienced. Every time one of our dishes was on its way to come out to us  it was as if the server was playing a guessing game. They would go up to two tables before finally figuring out it was our dish. I mean how hard could it be to deliver the food the appropriate table number? This is just plain inexcusable  get it together! STRIKE 2One of the only reasons I decided to go back to this restaurant after my first awful experience of getting cold food was the fact that I had purchased a fundraiser card from our local little league team. Once our ""stellar"" waitress came back to drop off the bill  it turned out she brought us out someone else\'s bill with OUR discount applied to it. After waiting another 5-10 minutes to flag her down & let her know that she had made a mistake  we finally got the right bill.  Our bill came out to $31 & I reluctantly handed over my credit card to escape this hell hole. Upon getting my card back I realize that I was charged for $33 dollars instead of the $31 that was on the tab previously. WHAT TYPE OF RESTAURANT CHANGES A BILLS TOTAL AFTER THE FACT? STRIKE 3.My girlfriend thought it was ridiculous & suggested to simply not leave a tip  but I didn\'t want to be rude. I flagged my waitress down & mentioned it to her & she seemed to have already known of the problem. If she knew  why hadn\'t she mentioned it to me!? Apparently the machine was having trouble honoring my discount and ended up charging me the full amount  which would have been nice to know. Upon the managers arrival he said their machines have been messing up and such. I did not want to hear this after the fact of my card being charged an amount I hadn\'t agreed to. You could tell some of the managers buddies were also in the patio area since he was raising his voice & making a scene out of it. I did not want to look like the petty guy complaining over a couple dollars but that is exactly what he tried to make me look like. I was arguing more over the principle of what had happened. Instead of being relaxed and care free  I was being annoyed. He mentioned  ""oh you want me to log the $1.70 discount? I mean I can easily do that if it will make you happy"" & he chuckled and said it in a way to belittle me in front of his friends. I eventually started ignoring what he had to say as he didn\'t seem to get what I was arguing over & I wouldn\'t be surprised if he was under the influence as well.  I still ended up giving the waitress her tip & paid the tab (without my discount) just so I could leave and not have bad karma laying over me. To sum it up  the wait staff is inexperienced  the servers are incompetent & the managers are unprofessional.  The only thing worth anything at this place are the pazookie\'s which if I ever get the urge to have one it certainly won\'t be from here. I will gladly drive the extra 30+ miles just to not have to ever lay foot in this specific location ever again."
Rich M.,Pittsburgh  PA,20,15,,1/24/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,We visited again and it went down hill. How many tables should I watch the manager visit and apologies to before I become concerned?I ordered a steak salad - the steak should have been medium  but it was well done. I would have said something but it already took 45 minutes to arrive so I figured it wasn't worth it.I ordered soup  but it arrived about 5 minutes before my entreeThey should take one of the dozens of floor staff members and put a few more in food prep.
Manny O.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,7,2,8/3/2014,1.0,The only good thing I can say is that the beer was cold-ish! Took 10-15 min for someone to take are order....
Carina L.,San Francisco  CA,109,34,14,4/15/2014,2.0,I don't know if it is just me but is this place over priced and overrated or what? I had a server with me and my boyfriend who was giving attitude and for some reason all those servers think too highly of themselves. I used to come here all the time because it's a sports bar and cool hang out spot  but I'm cool of the waiters if they are going to serve and give me attitude.
Adam X.,San Francisco  CA,380,449,1575,11/15/2010,3.0,Never had a more doughy pizza. Its like they believe the bread (deep dish is not bready  its buttery and crisp)  makes up for the lack of authenticity. It doesn't. They do have nice beers. 2 stars for the Beer selection... -3 for purporting to be Chicago Pizza. +1 for a great looking pizza however. (Photo in the Gallery)You have a great kitchen  I'm sure you can produce a real pizza. what you served me was not a real pizza  it was like kids food. Here is a comparison you might get: A great kids movie appeals to both kids and adults (i.e. Shrek); a good/great meal that is for all ages should do the same.
Mai W.,San Francisco  CA,476,118,365,8/24/2011,3.0,Create your own Ahi Tuna Salad at $11 instead of $12.951. Go during LUNCH2. Order Unlimited Soup and Salad Combo. (Get the house salad w/ vinaigrette)3. Order Seared Ahi Tuna from the Small Bites sectionSome friends and I went here for lunch and were all craving Ahi Tuna Salads. One friend ordered the real deal and two of us created our own combo. After the comparison  our own creation was way more worth it. We even had soup. The staff was great till the very end. We kept asking for a box was ignored.
Patricia G.,San Bernardino  CA,8,42,22,10/14/2014,4.0,Went with my sweetie for lunch and was very impressed with service and atmosphere after reading the so-so reviews on Yelp. Our waiter Joshua  was great and very accommodating. Had a great meal food was good and lunch specials are very filling  had to get the Pizookie to go! :)
David B.,San Francisco  CA,0,3,,12/2/2015,1.0,I have been here a few times and the service has gotten worse each time. This time was the last. 30 min to take an order  when the food comes out it was wrong and cold. The manager was nice enough to comp our meal. But this place has hit rock bottom.
Sandra L.,San Jose  CA,1,81,5,2/15/2015,1.0,Our waiter was the White Bald guy with green eyes; he was very Rude and he gave me attitude when I asked which drink was the customer across from me drinking. He responded and he said  ''I'll speak to you when I'm ready to speak to you.''I was in shock that our waiter acted Like a Diva drag queen. He should not work there if he is going to give bad customer service.
Esther Y.,Emeryville  CA,612,1574,1568,6/20/2011,4.0,Great service  great consistent BJ's food and drinks. My only complaints are about the patio  which I understand BJ's can't really do much about...if you're sitting outside on the patio  the planes flying overhead from SFO are deafening! It can also get pretty windy and cold out on the patio  and the outdoor heaters aren't too effective against the wind. Thankfully  the patio does have clear walls that help retain the heat just a bit.Anyways  onto the food! I absolutely loved the angel hair pasta dish  and the flatbreads are good too. You can't go wrong with the signature deep dish pizzas  and remember to get their infamous pazookie (giant freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top!) for dessert.Good selection of beers (I'm no expert in that area) and cocktails  and the mojitos are delicious!
Iris L.,San Francisco  CA,0,73,3,5/25/2014,1.0,My friend was hospitalized from eating Calamari take out once. She found blue substance in her food. She doesn't want to say anything to the company because she likes the place. But I'm not afraid to speak out for her. This is unacceptable. (See photos. I'm not the only one posting the calamari with blue substance)
Bobby M.,San Francisco  CA,19,10,,1/7/2015,1.0,Took my daughter to this location for her 18th birthday on 1/6/15. Previous visits to BJ's in Tanforan were pretty good  but for some reason this visit was the worst. Food was mediocre and our waiter  Rainier  disappeared before serving my daughter her birthday Pizookie. A waitress asked twenty minutes later us if we were still waiting for our Pizookie. So much for the surprise. One came to our table ten minutes later. And then another PIzookie arrived ten minutes after that. We had asked Rainier to split the bill 50-50  but he didn't do it because he never returned. The waitress kind enough to help us with my daughter's Pizookie brought the entire bill to us. Totally unprofessional. Never going to that place ever again. Stay away from this place - it's just a waste of time and money.
James L.,Bridgewater  NJ,1,6,,11/12/2015,5.0,Came here for lunch and sat at the bar. My day is done so I decided to have the Oasis Amber with the Chicken Club. Not to sound trite  but this lunch was easily one of the top 5 lunches I have ever had. The sandwich had so much flavor that I questioned whether this was a chain or a single restaurant. I can't recall ever having such good food from a restaurant chain before. Take note Fridays and Ruby Tuesdays  should a BJs open on your block! As for the Oasis Amber it hit the right sultry amber note with a moderate to heavy touch of carbonation; perfect for washing down a burger  pizza or in my case  an amazing chicken club. Service at the bar was friendly and professional  complete with the witty banter that makes the bar experience better than a lonely table. Living in NJ I was pleased to read that a location up north in NY opened just this year  about an hour drive from my home. I am looking forward to showing this place off to my wife and friends.
Krystal M.,El Monte  CA,11,27,18,9/22/2015,1.0,My friends and I came here for a birthday celebration so we needed a table for 6. They told us there would be a 45 minute wait so we walked around the bookstore next door. We waited for about 20 minutes and our table was ready so that was a great start. Unfortunately  our waiter wasn't social and we would have to ask for refills constantly. Once we got our food  one of us got a dirty spoon. We just had to constantly ask for everything and the waiter wasn't checking up on us. We had to ask different waiters and waitresses. Overall  the food was good but the service was not great. Also  we told them it was one of our friend's birthday and they forgot. We also had to split checks and that was the worst thing ever! We took about 30 minutes because then the waiter split up the checks wrong and it was just horrible. Then we were fed up so the manager came and fixed everything. This was such a horrible experience.
JJ S.,Sunnyvale  CA,101,90,128,9/24/2014,2.0,Service - our first server was great! She came by pretty often and checked if we needed anything but our second sever  I wished I remember her name  was horrible. We asked 2 times for a refill of our coffee and strawberry lemonade and I had to get up and request it a 3rd time by looking for her. The Ahi Poke wasn't too good. Just going to end it here because I can write more but it just isn't worth my time.
Andrew K.,San Francisco  CA,1903,4446,,5/23/2013,2.0,Chain reminiscent of the chains from my childhood. Clean space  nice waiter  long Cheesecake Factory-type menu. Very cheap - especially for lunch - they can't be using good ingredients. Made a few substitutions on my salad and kitchen was so confused that they took an extra 45 minutes for my food to come out. Food tasted so-so.
Danny C.,South San Francisco  CA,102,1209,382,5/18/2013,2.0,Two redeeming qualities - pizookies and friendly  quick waiters. Otherwise  this place is pretty bad. Deep dish pizza - nothing baked into the pizza. Not a deep dish  just a very fluffy  doughy pizza with the toppings on top. Nachos - almost nonexistent cheese and minimal pico de gallo. Potato skins - again  almost nonexistent layer of cheese. Cobb salads - under-dressed pieces of small iceberg lettuce with soggy croutons. Mozzarella salad - one piece of lettuce. Now  the pizookies were good  but you can't go wrong with ice cream on top of a fresh cookie. I recommend the cookies and cream kind. Otherwise  find somewhere to eat that won't cost you this much money for such poor food.
James D.,San Francisco  CA,64,43,3,10/12/2012,1.0,"I used to really enjoy going to BJs because they had decently priced food and drinks but sadly I gotta say they\'ve gone downhill in recent years. The food quality was never top notch to begin with (though that\'s kinda expected) but sanitation has become an increasing problem in my recent visits. I had ordered a mini pizza and as I began digging in I noticed an incredibly long hair baked into my pizza. I was offered a new pizza but I declined and the manager actually came to apologize. I didn\'t get anything complimentary but he removed the pizza from my bill so I didn\'t stress the issue.Fast forward to today and I am being served by someone who I\'m assuming is a nice lady but was either trained improperly or does not seem to understand how to read the menu. For starters we were told we weren\'t allowed to get a specific soup because it was neither a Wedneday or Saturday which apparently are the only days the soup is available. Upon looking at the menu it listed that the soup was ""Served Wednesday-Saturday"" and when we brought it up to the waitress she said that it was only for those two specific days listed. WHAT?!?!The last straw came with our bill. We ordered the lunch size pasta which comes with a soup or salad and is $1 off the regular price. My GF substituted the Shrimp for her meal bringing the regular price up about $1 and it was listed clearly that the total should be $13.95. Let\'s do simple math here: $13.95 - $1 because of the lunch special = what? If you said $12.95 you are wrong because it\'s actually $15+. When I addressed the error she took it to her supervisor and came back stating that I was wrong and even after pointing out the errors on their part she continued to insist they were right. Finally after some back and forth she came back with the ""corrected"" price of $13.05 and I realized that it would be a waste of time to wait for them to get the correct price of $12.95 so I paid the extra dime. I won\'t be coming back here for awhile and if you read this far  you may wanna stay away too. There are great servers here but the bad apples spoiled the bunch for me.Btw  even though our waitress (I won\'t say names) checked up on us maybe once every 15 mins  once I was supposed to sign the bill and leave a tip she decided to check up on me every 2 mins. Great prioritizing.."
Cheryl Q.,San Francisco  CA,78,210,209,9/17/2012,4.0,I used to come here frequently for birthday dinners  get-togethers  or just casual dinner/lunch. I haven't been here for about two years. A friend and I were studying across the way in the bookstore and decided to grab some lunch before leaving the mall. BJ's is just as how I remembered it! Good food  attentive staff  and clean. I ordered brunch-eggs with a bunch of veggies and avocados with wheat toast while my friend ordered his usual  the tilapia. Although I've been here plenty of times  I've never ordered anything from the brunch menu. My order was simple  satisfying  and delicious. We were eyeballing the bar as we were finishing our meals but had to make that flight to vegas!Make sure you order a pazookie (a freshly baked warm cookie topped with a large scoop of ice cream! DROOOOOOOOOOL) and if you're a fan of beer  check out the beer list which is listed from lightest to darkest!
Karl K.,San Francisco  CA,0,205,5,6/23/2013,3.0,Who are we kidding? You'd only ever eat here to watch a game with your friends. Not my first choice  but in that whole South City/North of San Mateo area  you could do a lot worse. I'd definitely come here before Hooters. Not all the seats have good views of the TVs  so arrive early and claim a table with a good angle.Section near the bar is open seating  but it's really hard to get a good seat before a big game in that area without showing up 90 minutes before tipoff/kickoff.
Tim L.,South San Francisco  CA,0,17,1,1/25/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,A year later  we were at the mall and decided to give them another shot. Verdict: much improved (or maybe we got lucky) so I'll add a star back on. At this rate we'll get them back to a 3 by 2016  no problem!
Eva L.,San Bruno  CA,0,5,1,12/19/2014,1.0,The service is really slow. Our server was rude when asking for our orders. She took 20minutes just to serve us water. Overall  we walked out because the service was terrible. I don't recommend this location to go too. Other BJ's are way better to enjoy the food. This location is ran by unprofessional management. I don't know why no changes have been made. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.
Raeann L.,San Jose  CA,66,3,,4/29/2014,2.0,The service here is HORRIBLE. First of all  the whole time we were here  we were not offered any water or given any water. I understand that we went during a playoff game and it gets super busy but that is no excuse for good customer service. Second of all  they had a shortage of glasses and pitchers and asked us to chug our beers so they could use our glasses. Although I agree that beers should be chugged and not sitting on the table waiting to be consumed  it's kind of rude to ask us to drink all our beers so you could use our glasses. If a customer wants to take their time with their drink  then allow them to do so. It's not our faults that you aren't prepared enough to provide glasses for customers to drink their beers especially since this is a popular place that allows customers to watch sports especially during big NBA playoff games with a Bay Area team playing. Oh and did I mention that another server came to our table and told us to pour the rest of what's in the pitcher into our glasses. Third of all  the server we had was not nice at all. She never came to our table and asked if we needed anything else or if we were doing okay. When we asked for a beer menu she kept walking away as she agreed to get it for us. And then just dropped it off at our table without acknowledging us or being polite about it. AND all of a sudden we had a different waitress. Nobody informed us whether the first server we had was going on a break or not. We had to find out by seeing her picking at her teeth with her finger nails. Fourth and foremost  they took away my salad that I didn't finish. They didn't ask if I was finished or if I wanted to take it home. There was still plenty left to eat and it irks me to know that they took it and didn't even dare to ask me if I was still eating it. One of the worst services I have ever experienced. If it weren't for the pizookies and avocado egg rolls  I would give this place one star.
El A.,South San Francisco  CA,9,125,40,7/18/2013,2.0,Went to BJ's yesterday with a party of 7. In addition to appetizers  we ordered a couple of large specialty deep dish pizzas. Although the service was great  we were so disappointed with the quality of the pizza. Let's see  how can I put this nicely? The deep dish pizza was 80% bread. I've tasted better quality pizzas at Pizza Hut and Dominoes.
S Y.,San Francisco  CA,262,388,5723,9/23/2010,1.0,"BJ\'s does not like me haha! To summarize my past experiences here; sipping my drink through a straw  I look down and a lipstick stain on my glass... barf. With a group of people  an hour wait for our food and my Scampi Pasta comes out topped with bread crumbs- NO sauce... WTF?! Ordered the Calamari appetizer and was served with no dipping sauce  they ended up being out of it and offered ketchup or ranch... GROSS! BJ\'s solution to these issues... FREE PIZOOKIE! woopty doo...So it was a nice day and since I had to do a few errands in San Bruno  BJ\'s outdoor seating sounded good at the time. Our waiter  Billy (name on the receipt) was nice  but very busy. Ordered a Hefeweizen for the bf and a Peach Mojito for myself. A different waiter comes by and places a glass of beer on our table that is not Hefeweizen and walks away before we can even mention it. We tell Billy and he said he\'ll check on our drinks and to keep it. 15 minutes later  another waiter comes by finally and hands me my Peach Mojito  then looks at my bf- looks at the beer in front of him and offers the Hef. As we start to explain we were given the wrong beer earlier  he makes a face and tells my bf  ""that\'s not a Hefeweizen but you drank it anyways?""Let me just say this before I go on  my bf is very well mannered  very laid back-and woulda let that comment slide. Me  I can be  but not when I\'m spoken to like that. So I looked at this crazy waiter and said  ""Excuse me  but we have been sitting here for 20 minutes without our drinks  in the sun- you\'re damn right we drank from it. But since you\'ve finally decided to bring our drinks-TAKE IT!"" And this waiter really did take it. Ridiculous.We get our pizza. I take a slice out of the deep dish pan and put it on on my plate. I touch it  and it felt cold. I touch the slice everywhere  hoping it was just the tomato or something- everything wasn\'t even warm to the touch. I touch the pan thinking that at least has gotta be hot. Nope. At this point  I just grab the pan with my bare hands. WTF? A deep dish pizza that was just served I can hold with my bare hands. What is wrong with this picture? I walk inside  pan in hand and a waitress asks me if she could help me. I told her to have our waiter take it off my bill.Our waiter comes by and apologizes and asks if I want anything else  but why would I? To prove our waiter was sincere in his apologies he spoke to his manager. The manager came out to apologize and handed me a $15 gift card. Overall  if I was starving I woulda been a straight B****! But I came with the intentions of chillin\' in the sun  having a drink and pizza- all I ask for is my pizza to be hot and for the drink waiter- DO NOT GIVE ME ATTITUDE! Who wants this damn $15 card? Cause I sure as hell ain\'t gonna use it!"
Crystal Z.,Daly City  CA,0,9,2,11/12/2014,3.0,I really liked this place when they first opened up but now it's just not the same. The service is slow  they check on the table 30 minutes at a time  and they are forgetful. I know it's busy but wouldn't you want business to go smoothly with more staff? The food is good but I always get the same stuff.. wings.. pizza.. grilled chicken pasta. Overall service is poor and slow. Elephant bar has way more potential than this place. I don't even want to order more food and even dessert because I know they will take forever! If your hungry don't come here!
CR C.,San Francisco  CA,0,15,,11/8/2013,4.0,Food: The food is very good but many times very salty.Service: The staff is very kind. However  there is a very high turnover as it's constantly busy  but we don't usually wait too long.Ambiance: Casual chic and they are always welcoming of our service dog  which is great.
Carolyn S.,New York  NY,2,12,,1/17/2016,1.0,Came here on a Sunday at 5 and the initial interaction with the hostesses who ignored my brother to finish a conversation among themselves for several minutes shoould have been our first clue to not bother- but we ate here anyway. We order food for 3 adults and 1 child. The food comes for the three adults- but not the child. My salad had a huge hair on it  so I immediately send it back with the same person who brought it over. Fast forward 10 minutes- no waitress and no food for myself or my nephew. I ask a waiter to go get our waitress. he returns a couple minutes later and asks what her name is. She never said  so we did not know  but cant you figure that out? She finally comes over- still with no food- and no apology or explanation. I ask for a manager. A woman walks over and is very nice and says she will go check. She walks away and doesnt come back. Now a soup that was also missing arrives- still no salad sans hair  and no kids meal. The missing food finally comes (its been about 20 minutes and the other two adults are basically done eating). Another manager comes over and apologizes  gets us more water (we had needed water for a majority of this time) and makes adjustments to the check while promising our server will be attentive to us the rest of the meal. he was very nice and I appreciated his apology and check adjustment. However the waitress did not come back  and when it was time for the check a waiter comes over and says she has gone on break but he will get the check. Really?? The food was decent but certainly not worth the hassle. As much fun as it is to make a two year old wait for his food for 20 minutes after his parents both have food and to receive a salad with hair in it  Ill pass next time and take my business elsewhere.
Joylne C.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,11/11/2015,5.0,Two thumbs up for our server Edward  he was very attentive at our lunch yesterday. My father has Celiac and can't have any gluten and when we let our server know this he was very attentive and followed our order from start to finish. Many times the server will take your order and someone else delivers it. Not Edward  he made sure my father was well taken care of. Thank you Edward.
Rose A.,Daly City  CA,357,618,2587,3/29/2011,4.0,BJ's has a huge menu! Their clam chowder is really delicious - thick and creamy. Their wedge salad is yummy  too. They have a lot of really good appetizers and cocktails as well. Of course their pizookies are awesome! I was; however  disappointed with what they call deep dish pizza. The service is usually good but the restaurant usually gets really crowded so the wait for the table can be a bit long.
William S.,San Francisco  CA,0,22,2,5/19/2014,2.0,My attorney and I were seated just before lunch time. There were many open tables at 11:30 a.m. on a Monday. The hostess seemed to be too preoccupied chatting with the help to notice us at first and left us waiting for about three minutes while she handled some administrative chores. Not a good start.We made THREE requests before and after being seated to TURN DOWN THE MUSIC. Enough Ike and Tina Turner! We couldn't even hear one another. NOTHING was done about the shrieking music even after I asked to speak to the manager (he never showed). The volume and on-going litany of lousy music disrupted our conversation incessantly. The service was 'perfunctory'. The waiter only reappeared once: at the conclusion of the meal to present us a check. Receiving the food on the table took nearly 25 minutes for two hamburgers and fries! Was BJs sending their own livestock out to slaughter first? The burger was LOUSY! It was covered with grill carbon - you know - the carcinogenic 'stuff' you're not supposed to eat. And the meat had one flavor: you guessed it: CARBON. Yuck! The fries were not hot  but they were not greasy - a good point from a true fry lover.Overall  spend your bucks at In and Out Burger. You'll be a more delighted customer with more change left in your wallet.
Jay S.,Emeryville  CA,2,61,4,10/30/2014,4.0,This was our third time at B&J brewry when we walked in the wait was 15 to 20 minutes and finally we were seated. Several managers pass by our table so I grab one and let them know that our last past experiences at the restaurant was negative she promised that his time it would be good and it was so I'm going to give it a 4-star our food was excellent I can't promise the next time we go it'll be good I might just have to tell the manager each time I go about the negative experience I had several months ago. My advice to people when you go to a new restaurant rate each experience meaning each time you go back to the restaurant don't judge a book by its cover.
Jennie C.,San Francisco  CA,53,24,31,10/4/2014,1.0,Came in waited 10 min before getting a table. The place was half empty. it took another 15 min before the waiter took our order. 25 min later my food is still not here.. slow slow slow service..
Jeanely H.,South San Francisco  CA,61,25,,10/26/2014,3.0,Came here a couple of times now. Service has been okay and food was good. My husband wasn't thrilled about their blackened chicken pasta; average at best he said. Both times the place was really busy  but was seated within a reasonable time.
Monette P.,Vacaville  CA,69,70,71,7/19/2013,3.0,it is the best you can get for a mall restaurant. I don't mind the food but the staff can really be hit or miss.  25% of the time i get really lucky and have a fantabulous waiter who is on top of it and friendly to me and my kids. about the other 75% of the time i get some rude inattentive person and have to run laps to get someones attention for a refill (i've walked up to the bar myself a couple of times). I go here often because of its location and late hours. I just wish their staff was better trained in customer service and organization.
H G.,San Francisco  CA,2,88,1,9/21/2015,1.0,Really dunno why I came here. I tried to hide from the heat thinking they had AC  which they did. But I could barely make it home before I had the runs. Still suffering from it 2 hours later. I suspect it was the unwashed raw celery. It looked suspicious but I was hungry (and dumb).
Juvy G.,Burlingame  CA,134,38,30,8/7/2012,2.0,"Visited on Saturday around 5pm. Normal dining. Got sat really quick  no wait. Server  Donia  was friendly. However  food took 45 minutes to arrive. Server kept saying the food would come out soon but it never did. She said she let the manager know already  but it seemed like the manager didn\'t do anything about it since it was 30 minutes ago since she told him and the food was still not out. I could have understood if the place was busy-- but it wasnt. Then when my food came out  it was incomplete. But she insisted that everything was there. But when i looked around-- the vegetables were missing. So i asked for the manager-- which took 15 minutes.When the manager  Spencer  came out  he said  ""So I understand your food took too long to come out? Just for future references-- it should not take more than 8-10 minutes for a steak salad."" He then apologized but just took my plate away. He made sure i didnt think the server forgot to ring in my food--but the way he said it made it seem like he was covering for her. OKAY SIR. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.. you and your staff should take note of that and you should have intervened ASAP once the server told you it was taking forever. And as a manager  you should have personally checked in with me... and explained instead of waiting for ME to ask for you. anyways--didnt feel like ordering anything else. lost my appetite. this place is only good if you want to get drinks at the bar and make use of their TV. other than that-- service sucks. food takes forever. Management clearly does not care if customers leave unhappy. They totally need to work on that."
Diana D.,San Bruno  CA,0,6,31,10/3/2015,3.0,"Absolutely don\'t recommend their Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi. The fish is ""about nothing ""  completely tasteless. Bison burger is not bad though."
Ben T.,San Francisco  CA,374,185,14,4/12/2013,1.0,What can you actually like about this place? I had a friend reserve a table for 20 for her 21st birthday at 9:30. That seems like a pretty decent hour to seat a table of 20  right? Most people would clear out  you can set it up in the back  try not to double stack tables  and we're all good  right?How did they manage to make us wait over an hour and half for the table? Despite my pleas and begs to refuse our business to this place  we ended up staying anyway.The bar barely stocks call liquor. The food is a mediocre greasy mess. Our waiter was trying his best  besides being fairly inept at taking a large group. Even an avocado egg roll didn't cheer me up after this fiasco.
Alyssa S.,San Mateo  CA,133,120,,6/7/2012,3.0,"I wish people would stop celebrating their birthdays here. During my college years  I came here WAY too often. If I had it my way  I\'d opt for Hooters instead. Their menu  while extremely (and over-overwhelmingly) extensive  is pretty average if you ask me. I can say that everything that I\'ve tried there isn\'t something that makes me go ""YES that\'s what I want every single time"" (which is what I usually do when I like something--very Sheldon-esque). Plus the food is overpriced and the wait is freakishly long. Its advantage over the one in San Mateo/Foster City is that at least it\'s in Tanforan and I can do some shopping while I wait.The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars over 2 stars (and really the main reason why I ever go to any BJs) is strictly for the pizookie. Hot chocoloate chip cookie with some ice cream on top? TO DIE FOR. Why can\'t all restaurants just offer this so I don\'t have to resort to BJs? I recently tried the red velvet white chocolate chip pizookie. Also very good but a little too sweet even for this sweet tooth so I\'ll still with the classic moving forward.Other positives: beer selection is awesome  there\'s an abundance of TVs  and their Happy Hour makes it worthwhile (but its only available in the bar area which fills up quickly).I will say  service has always been decent. Nothing bad to report with that. Just the food in general is just MEH."
Nellie N.,Daly City  CA,0,42,1,12/4/2012,2.0,"BJ\'s is always crowded  one would hope this is because of the quality food  unfortunately there must be other reasons  as the food is consistently disappointing and orders are routinely missing requested options such as ""dressing on the side"" resulting in a salad smothered in dressing.Pros --brewed beer-lots of HDTVs-location-options on the menuCons -- Woefully under-staffed take-out area-orders are incorrect 80% of the time (missing sauce  items  side orders etc..)-food is highly processed typical frozen/pre-made chain food-so many items on the menu  but only a few are half decent-management unable to provide direction to army of kids doing the work-cooks/food prep lack skill and direction.  Everything is microwaved/salty/fried-bagged / pre-chopped lettuce -long waits for take out or seating -potential gold mine location is mismanaged as some staff stand around with nothing to do while others are overwhelmed and backed up as orders sit and get coldFor a chain restaurant  BJ\'s would receive high marks. It\'s certainly much better than Applebees  or Olive Garden  they brew their own beer  and have a wide variety of items that are a bit more modern than the fare at Applebees.The main problem is many of the ingredients are clearly ""pre-prepped"" items. This is standard for many chain restaurants and unfortunately even local places take this short cut. For instance the salad uses chopped iceberg lettuce and pre-made boiled eggs.  I suspect the lettuce is cut and bagged  the reason I suspect this is because of how dry it often is and many times there is a lot of browning around the edges of the chopped area.The chicken fingers on top of the salad are clearly pre-cooked  frozen variety  Safeway frozen food section quality. Is it really that hard to use fresh chicken on a salad? Apparently this is a money/time saver.  It\'s very simple to make your own breaded chicken breast  it\'s borderline insulting to use frozen/pre-made and then sell it on a restaurant menu.Probably the best items I\'ve had from BJs are the ""small bites"" fried artichokes and chicken wontons.  While these also taste pre-made/frozen  it\'s the type of food that holds up ok to being processed. Dipping fried wontons in hot sauce and blue cheese is a classic experience that is difficult to mess up.But BJ\'s has managed to mess it up by routinely forgetting to include the blue cheese with to-go orders.The take-out section is woefully understaffed. Usually by 1 or 2 very young kid is tasked with handling the ever-ringing phone  walk in orders  and bagging and sorting it all.  Meanwhile a middle aged manager usually roams around pointing and making conversation with seated guests. At the hostess area  a group of young kids usually stands there aimlessly and making small talk with each other while the take-out area is 5 orders deep  and having difficulty arranging it all.You have to wonder if BJs management cares at all what anyone thinks. They are constantly crowded  and consider it\'s much better food than the nearby ""Hooters"" you have to assume that ""good enough"" is all they are concerned with.Truthfully  if you are in the Tan-Foran mall  what else are you going to do? Hooters  Food Court  Red Robin are your options.  All of them poor."
Tina A.,San Francisco  CA,2,58,8,9/19/2013,4.0,I should start by saying I've only had takeout before and usually my husband picks it up. It seems like most people have a problem with the bad service at this place  but this review is only based on the food. I've had their pizza  crispy chicken sandwich  pot roast  and a variety of their appetizers. The crispy chicken sandwich is DELICIOUS! It's pretty big (for me)  so I usually eat it for 2 meals  and it heats up nicely. I wasn't a fan of their thin  crispy fries (might be because they got soggy since we did takeout)  but the wedge fries are decent. Overall  I think the food is above average. There have been a few appetizers that I didn't care for like the wontons  but most things I've had here  I have liked. This is our go-to place if we work late and don't have time to prepare dinner.
V U.,Daly City  CA,81,152,5,6/3/2012,3.0,This story is based on actual facts. My cousin visited from the Philippines and I wanted him to experience all the things in my city that were worth eating. Have you tried a pizookie?No.. What's that? A Peezookey?*Dead silence as I gasp in disbelief*Two days later  he's scooping warm gooey soft chewy cookie with vanilla ice cream in his mouth and is staring at me in bewilderment. Where has this been my whole life!I'm telling myself the same exact thing.. Now  he dreams about pizookies. Sure  they might be a little overhyped but their delicious. And it only took me til now to realize that pizookie is a short for pizza cookie. Lol
Tom C.,South San Francisco  CA,44,512,30,6/23/2013,3.0,Wow  I guess there is no where else to go on a Friday night at 11pm - it was packed. I tried the new Bison Burger - it was very slow coming out  very slow - and it was cold when I got it. I didn't say anything because I didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes for another one.BJ's is usually pretty good - I just think they aren't prepared for a busy crowd.
Janice V.,San Francisco  CA,368,600,798,3/20/2011,4.0,I've been here a couples of time already to have dinner with my boyfriend or out with friends. I came here for my boyfriend's birthday and we had a big party. I called the day before to make a reservation but they said they weren't able to take reservations after 5:30pm. My boyfriend and I decided to come really early around 5pm since we were planning on having the dinner around 7ish to ask if we can reserve a spot. I guess all that wait was worth it because we were able to get a spot despite of how pack the restaurant was at that time. The waitress that we had was really nice and very attentive. She really wanted us to have a really great experience at BJ's which she did. This restaurant is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the area probably cause I'm able to watch sports here  haha. Their pazookie is my favorite dessert ever. I tried to make my own pazookie at home but it doesn't taste the same as the one here which is why one time I was craving it so bad that I got it to go  lol.

Raquel G.,Millbrae  CA,11,18,9,9/3/2013,1.0,Tonight I ordered food online to be ready in time to grab on my way to pick up my bf from work. I show up on schedule to pick up the food and no one seems to know where my food is so the to go girl goes in the back to check with her manager. She returns about 5min later to let me know they aren't sure why my order was never made and that she already put in the order to be ready in 10mins. That made me feel ok so I say and waited. I paid full price for my late order and didn't even receive an apology from the manager which felt like poor customer service. She showed up in about 15min with my order. In a hurry I didn't have a chance to double check the order. My bf and I get home  take out our food to discover that his food is perfect and mine is a mess. My order was a Santa Fe salad with blackened shrimp. -My blackened shrimp was not blackened and barley cooked-The lettuce was wet and soggy even though I didn't even have dressing on it-There was no corn or cheese -There was a piece of chicken-There was a piece of something that resembled grown beefI brushed off having to wait for my order to be made but to serve me something incomplete and unsatisfactory was unacceptable. I will never order food here again after my horrible experience and I do not recommend this place to anyone.
Sylvia J.,Alameda  CA,1,7,,10/5/2014,1.0,Rudest hostess ever!!! Not sure what her name was but she was very pale and had a ton of makeup on. She got all crazy with me for asking a question very bad attitude. That ruined the whole experience. Hire better people customer service is important!
Nicole V.,San Juan Capistrano  CA,0,4,,10/27/2015,5.0,I ordered a cheeseburger and it was delicious! Our server was so kind and willing to make our dining experience memorable. I got the Irish root beer  which is Irish whiskey  root beer  and Irish cream all in a big chilled mug. Its to die for. I will definitely be back to this restaurant and recommend tit to my family and friends. Thanks guys!
Michelle B.,Oakland  CA,758,356,446,9/20/2010,3.0,This is our go-to place when we want to do the chain restaurant thing. Definitely a cut above all the chains I'd rather not mention. I'm a bit perplexed with myself as I only order one thing on this massive size menu - the spaghetti with meat sauce and an add-on of meatballs. Sometimes  when we feel like going nutz..we order the fried calamari - uh huh - we loco! My girls love their kid's menu as do i for the bargain value and big portions - $5 friggin dollars and 95 friggin cents for an entree plus side PLUS a drink - free refills - with that kind of value we can do an occasional chain-restaurant visit. The service is hit or miss...good thing tips are based on the service - cuz if you suck you ain't getting jack! comprende?
Ashley M.,Eugene  OR,476,401,763,7/8/2012,4.0,I came into BJ's on a Thursday afternoon with my brother to grab some lunch. This place is huge! Many tables inside  a few outside  and even some in the mall where BJ's is attached. The staff greeted us kindly and we were seated immediately. The place was busy but not packed and soon I was sippin' on a watermelon mojito (one of their signature drinks). The mojito was alright  all I could really taste was the Watermelon Puckers they pour into it but I knew I was chancing it with something that was watermelon flavored in the first place. My brother works at a BJ's in Sonoma County so he knew what to order and what to not order. We had the potato skin appetizers and the California club flat bread. Both were tasty in an artery clogging sort of way. I had a few bites of each and man did I feel 10 pounds heavier. We packaged up most of it for the people back home and ordered our main course. The ahi tuna salad was giant and satisfying. I asked for no bell peppers and Voil! No red bell peppers!...(I swear every time I ask for that no one can handle it). When I saw the tiny drops of wasabi around my plate I thought I'd have to order more but I was wrong. The wasabi is SOOOOO SPICY! I can handle a good amount with my sushi at most authentic Japanese restaurants and eat more than the average person but this stuff was lethal. I liked it. My brother had the crispy chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. The potatoes are really cheesy but yummy none the less. We were stuffed but decided to share a mini Oreo Cookie Pazooki. It's a scoop of Oreo Cookie ice cream on a chocolate cookie with oreo cookie mousse on the side. It was the perfect small size for a few bites...unlike the table next to us ordering the 7 scoop  giant cookie party Pazooki! Damn! The music they play here is completely random so be prepared to hear quite the variety while enjoying your food. All in all this is a great restaurant for all ages and types of people. They have a large menu with tons to choose from drink and food wise. It's very similar to the cheesecake factory  minus the cheesecake.
Kim S.,Terrell  TX,4,25,,10/7/2015,2.0,Seriously disappointed. The place smelled like stale beer and . Our waiter was absent most of the time we were there  food and drinks were delivered by other waitstaff. Our food arrived before our drinks did.
Deidra H.,Pacifica  CA,0,27,3,10/26/2014,1.0,Waitress stole money from us! We gave her $38 cash and told her to put the rest on the card. We saw her drop it on the way to the cash register and she left a dollar on the ground. She proceeded to finish our transaction at the register minus the dollar she dropped. She then walks back towards us and picks up the dropped dollar and slides it in her pocket  thinking we didn't see her. We all watched this happen and gave her the chance to give it back but she never did. I don't care if it was just a dollar  it's still stealing. On top of that she smelled of strong cigarette smoke and had a lot of attitude. She would've racked up a nice tip with us bc we spent a good amount. I rarely have good experiences here. Hope management did something about it.
Christy V.,San Jose  CA,90,22,3,5/24/2012,4.0,I feel so weird when people write bad reviews for a place and then I write a good one. Especially when I know the bad reviewer *ahem* Jessica A. hahah. I never had a bad experience here (knock on freakin wood!). I once left my backpack under the table and ran back to get it  and they kept it safe in the back for me. The wait can be long  but my bf and I usually try to snag a bar seat cuz it's first come first served. I'm hopelessly in love with their red velvet pizookie  and orange twist drink! The portabello pizza is good too..
Christine M.,San Francisco  CA,461,593,210,9/24/2012,3.0,HH! on a friday at 6pm  luckily someone was leaving and we didn't have to wait long for a table in the HH section.we ordered some drinks  i had a pomegranate sunset  kind of strong but yummy.nachos- good to munch on  not enough toppings though....potato skins- crispy skin  but eh potato3 mini pizzas- the hawaiian one  the original and the bbq chicken. i liked the bbq chicken best.overall a very chill HH  great spot for talking and catching up and watching the game. service was good  they checked on us often enough.decent HH price. and we finished everythinggggg fatties.
Jorge A.,San Bruno  CA,18,3,,10/20/2014,4.0,Pretty good service here  I've had my share of very bad experiences with the food quality but they have been able to give me reasons to comeback again  the jalapeno burger is a must at this restaurant  always order take out since it's really loud in here  overall great food and pretty good service with the take out server.
Cindy W.,Millbrae  CA,0,5,,10/18/2014,2.0,I just came back from Bj's  I went two of my friends. The food was okay but I didn't really like the service. I didn't really like the service because this asian lady didn't want to separate our checks into 3 and told us just to put the money in there. So we ask another waitor if he can do it for us he said no our waitress has to do it and we also told him one of us is paying in card. She came back and we ask her again but she said to write down our total from each of us. We put in our money and she took it and she only gave us part of the changes. I even checked on my phone.
Elise S.,San Jose  CA,2,74,2,10/17/2014,2.0,Went here with my boyfriend last night and watched the Giant's game. We didn't see our server for about 40 minutes after we got our food. It wasn't like she was walking back and forth very busy  which I can definitely sympathize with having been a server myself. I didn't even see her at all  so we weren't sure if she went on break or forgot about us or what  which guests shouldn't have to wonder. Finally we got boxes and a dessert menu  but I had to go to the front to ask for a manager to help. The manager said she would pay for the dessert for us  but I got the bill and the dessert was still on there. I don't really mind if they don't offer to take anything off the bill  but at least do it when you say you will. Really poor service...the only reason I'll come back is for the food.
Albert L.,Temple City  CA,317,177,61,3/20/2011,3.0,I only like 3 things at BJ's:1) the Heff beer2) the avocado egg rolls3) the PizookieAnd I suppose I like the sports bar type of atmosphere because you can be as loud as you want with your group of friends
Allan A.,Daly City  CA,10,67,145,8/22/2014,3.0,The stars are all for the service that i got ive been coming here for a long time and this is the first i came in for lunch i ordered arugula salad with yellow bits let me let you guys know that it was the worse salad experience i ever had my entire life and im talking about from all the places ive been around the globe first salad that came in it looks like it was sitting for a long time the second time the arugula are all stale and yellow color plus forgot the dressing good thing this place have good server to cover the food because if it is not for the service i got today from the waiter i will never come back to this place
Cathy M.,San Francisco  CA,146,151,431,12/21/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"NEVER COMING BACK. Got there with a friend around 5pm for HH last night on a Friday but we were waiting for 2 more friends to join us. So while we were waiting we ordered a total of 3 rounds of shots and some apps. Finally my other 2 friends showed up at 6:30pm so we ordered 7 more shots-almost a double shot per person and some cocktails. Since HH ends at 7pm we squeezed in 3 more shots. That\'s a total of 16 shots among 4 of us. It may sound like a lot but trust me it wasn\'t. They totally skimp on the shots..it\'s about 50% less than what other places would normally serve. That\'s why we had to double it up. Right when we received all our drinks and our food and was getting ready to dig in and ENJOY our Friday  a manager named Cacy came over to us and starts asking us if we were ""OK"" and if we needed anything else. We told him everything was good...but yet he still lingered at our table and gave us this weird vibe. We can tell his intentions were not simply just checking in on his customers. So finally I asked...""are you kicking us out?"" He replied ""No  but I won\'t be able to serve you guys any more drinks."" WHAT?!! We all just looked at each other in shock. Did we just get cutoff for the night??? At 7:05pm??? Yes we did!! His explanation was because we ordered too much within the last hour and he\'s concerned for our safety. We told him that we\'ve been here since 5pm...Almost half of it was ordered during that time and the last round we doubled it up because HH was ending. Our drinks were still on the table. He can clearly see that. Furthermore  we were not loud or rowdy at all. In fact the group next to us at the bar was pounding shots left n right  breaking glasses  and extremely loud but I\'m positive that they did not get cut off. What kind of BS is this? He totally offended and targeted us! Ok I can understand that you have your policies to abide by  but why not wait until we order the next round and then inform us of your ""cutoff"" policy. Why do it RIGHT AFTER we received our drinks and food? How do you expect us as customers to be able to enjoy our dining experience?? This was just absolutely Ridiculous. We were so pissed it\'s not even funny. We requested to speak to another manager regarding Cacy\'s offensive and unprofessional approach but it didn\'t get anywhere as well. He apologized and we accepted his apology at the time but we will never come back. NEVER."
Rosalind S.,San Francisco  CA,227,737,237,2/1/2013,3.0,This was my 2nd time here because we needed to find a book store and there happens to be one across the way. I guess it was breakfast time so I got a breakfast pizza. I had one slice but polished off the potatoes  YUM!Washed it down with a bloody mary. Boyfriend got some sandwich and a mimosa that was made with bad sparkling wine. He's picky because he's French. haha
Sean-Paul G.,San Jose  CA,256,38,30,7/27/2010,3.0,Came in on a Saturday afternoon round 3. Joint wasn't too crowded so my buddy and I came in for a bite to eat...you know...get some energy in for the perfect shirt search ahead.We took a seat in the bar area and after a couple minutes  a server came by and handed us menus and took our drink order. I had an iced tea while my friend had an Arnold Palmer.My iced tea was a little watered down and his Arnold Palmer was waaaay too tart. Like lip puckering tart....We were served our meals without silverware or napkins (not that you need silverware for burgers and fries...but you'd think they'd provide it just in case you wanted to cut the burger down more into manageable bites.Had to flag the server down for that...I ordered the Cuban Burger with the wedge cut fries and my friend had the Classic Burger with the crispy thin fries.Our burgers were excellent. Perfectly cooked...grilled with just a little pink in the middle. The ham really set my burger off...so yummy.Now onto the fries....The wedge cut fries were great...each one was crisp and warm....ranch is a great dipper with these suckers.The crispy-thin fries...not so great. They were a little warm and soggy. Seems like they were sittin under a heat lamp for quite some time.The server didn't come around as much as we wanted him to...but he was nice and responded to our requests with the quickness.It was an OK experience...but nothing to write home about....Writing to Yelp it...that's a different story.
JJAMZ C.,El Cerrito  CA,63,392,22,3/4/2013,3.0,Ok place.Friendly staff - with the exception that they should know how to pour beer in a brewhouse without overfilling and letting it foam over.My son loves their desserts! The pazooki is what he always looks forward to.The burger I had was good. was cooked just right and had crispy bacon and soft bun.The clam chowder was a little on the salty side.My sister always orders their ahi tuna salad.
Jessica S.,San Francisco  CA,147,19,3,4/24/2012,5.0,I won't lie. The service is decent here. Sometimes we get a grumperton and sometimes we get someone awesome. I really believe that if you're nice to them that they are nice to you. I come here often so it's very seldom that I get someone grumpy. This review mostly goes out to Ruben  James and Christina (which is why I gave them 5 stars). They are my 3 absolute favorites here. They are ALWAYS so friendly and they make me happy. Ruben and James also bartend and they make my drinks perfect every time. They take care of their people and I appreciate it so much. BJ's is VERY busy almost all of the time so I don't mind if I have to wait around. This place really doesn't get you in and out all the time. If you're not prepared to wait then don't come here. However  if you end up getting Ruben  James or Christina... you won't be disppointed.
jennifer f.,San Francisco  CA,192,46,2,2/23/2013,4.0,BJ's is always a hit or miss.but as always  you don't come to a place with 20 big screen tvs for fancy service or good food... you come for the 20 big screen tvs. This is a great place to watch a game (baseball season is coming up!). especially if you're rooting for the local team  guaranteed the whole restaurant will root with you. (my personal experience from going to BJ's during the giant's 2012 world series games) Makes for a fun time  guaranteed.Besides the tvs  their variety of beer is always a must try. i've done the sampler twice and now i know i hate dark beer. Their berry cider is a must try for newbies (really sweet  tastes like soda).Another thing that is unique to BJ's is definitely their pizookie. who would've thought? a giant cookie topped with ice cream to share.. genius!
Tiffany H.,Davis  CA,146,76,20,2/20/2013,4.0,BJs is the restaurant of choice whenever we plan a group dinner. Not for their food  but for their atmosphere and large tables. This is the place to be if you want to go out to watch a game. The food is good  but not superb. I'm a plain Jane and always order the same thing every time-- their spaghetti with marinara sauce. That and their minestrone soup when available. We don't go there for good food we go for their atmosphere. Waiters here are also very nice and accommodating.The wait here is usually an hour  so remember to call in and reserve a table!
Elle N.,San Francisco  CA,25,12,,2/12/2014,2.0,The boyfriend and I decided to come here since we haven't been here in awhile. Was seated really fast  and food came out within 10 minutes. Why the 2 stars? 1 star for bring seated quickly  1 star for the quickness of the food coming out. We waited about 30 minutes to get the check and maybe order dessert. I was planning on getting the pizookie but I guess I'm not. So many waiters have come and gone and not one of them asks us if we want the bill or if we want to order dessert. We saw many of the other waiters check up on their tables but we were totally ignored. We didn't even know where our waiter went. We've definitely had better service before. Would we come back? Don't know... Poor service.
Glen S.,Minneapolis  MN,29,243,3,12/12/2012,2.0,Yeahhhhhh....I'll pass on writing anything too bad  but I mean  it's your typical chain.I really don't know I'm reviewing this. BJ's isn't really a place someone goes to because they like it  but rather  there is no where else to go and watch some sports.It's TGI Friday's with a different name.
Jessica A.,San Francisco  CA,605,215,416,2/22/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Yeah  I KNOCKED DOWN TWO STARS from my previous visit. I feel like my experiences here keep getting worse & worse. BUT..a different situation. I didn't even physically make it to BJ's & still had a bad experience. What's up with that?!Okay  so it was a Friday evening two week ago & my family wanted to go to a mini-celebratory dinner. I have the number saved on my phone  so I decided to call ahead for a party of 5. I called a little before 6:30pm & was told that the wait would be 1-1.5 hours. I put my name down. It was super busy on the streets & freeway  so it took awhile to get in the area. Before exiting  I called to see how the wait was at that moment since a bunch of time had passed since I called. I was told that the hostesses were busy  so whoever answered the phone would check himself. Let me put it out there now..I WAS ON THE PHONE FOR 16 MINUTES!!!! (yelp.com/biz_photos/FMGN) I'm a pretty patient person to wait that long  but 16 MINUTES just to see what our wait is?! & I got PUT ON HOLD THREE TIMES & had to ASK THE SAME THING TWICE. Also..I came to find out THAT I WASN'T EVEN PUT ON THE LIST IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!! What's the point of having a call-ahead service?!!? I don't care that it's a busy Friday night..if you're going to advertise the call-ahead option  GO BY IT & PUT PEOPLE DOWN!!! I was so fed up on the 3rd hold that I just hung up & WE TOOK OUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!!!Way to bring down the mood. I was in a really good mood..hence the MINI-CELEBRATORY DINNER...but yes BJ's  YOU RUINED IT!! Who makes a customer wait 16 MINUTES..actually MORE than that since I got so fed up that I hung up. I don't know anyone else who'd wait on hold for 16 minutes for ANY business. That's just ridiculous. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE..even over the phone.I have yet to go back & not really sure if I even want to anymore. The service keeps getting worse & I'm not even sure that it's worth it. Maybe the drive to another location is more worth it.
Glenn H.,Pacifica  CA,150,654,543,11/20/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"B.J.\'s has done something wonderful and horrible to their menus.They\'ve added calorie counts (GASP! ACK! COVER YOUR EYES!) 8^OYes  either I had selective inattention to the plainly printed calorie counts (both per slice or per dish--except for drinks) or they have recently begun to add this for the benefit of their chubby clientele.

This actually made it harder to order than normal because now you are painfully AWARE of the caloric damage that a BJ\'s Cuban burger (Calories: 1 249 (but also not in the menu: Fat: 73g  Carbs: 37g  104g Protein)) or even their ""healthy"" Sesame Chicken Salad (950 calories) per salad  have LOTs more calories than you think you are getting as a single serving.With these subtle warnings in hand  we settled for healthier  lower calorie options [Appetizers comprised our dinner: really good California flat-bread and excellent BBQ pork sliders] but it really opens your eyes that even a mini pizza  and most of their dinner menu items  have enough calories (1 000 +- 100) to split  unless you like splitting your pants. Service was excellent this time but this is not a consistent quality at this BJs. I did appreciate their call-ahead feature: you can call in ahead of your actual arrival  thus giving you a waiting place in line  so it shortens your actual waiting time there.Enjoy the more informative BJ\'s menu! :)"
Adel H.,Daly City  CA,1,89,,9/26/2014,2.0,Service was pretty horrible. How many times do I have to repeat myself to get something? I told the server like 4 times for a to-go box and eventually got it. He told me he would bring me back more water  but did that happen? Haha no. No refill during the whole dinner. The fresh Atlantic salmon was decent (hence the 1 extra star). Everything else fails.
Michelle H.,San Francisco  CA,33,13,3,6/16/2013,2.0,"This place feels beyond generic. We went on a Friday night and sat in a booth in the bar area. The service was incredibly slow - I understand Friday nights are busy.. but it took ages to get our drinks and almost 45 minutes for our food (half of which was forgotten by our waiter and brought out 10+ minutes after everyone else\'s food had arrived). The food was average at best - while the food prices weren\'t bad  nothing on the plate stood out and could probably be found at any other chain restaurant.I was in awe of how expensive the drinks were - I got two ""Arnold Strongers"" and was shocked that the were almost 10$ each. They certainly didn\'t /taste/ like 10$ drinks.The atmosphere wasn\'t bad. They had TVs set up in the bar and would be a great atmosphere for groups or families.I\'d maybe come back for Happy Hour.. but definitely could find far better food and service elsewhere."
Julie Z.,San Jose  CA,172,306,34,4/15/2012,2.0,hit and miss. came here for a birthday party and then again for happy hour. Happy hour is just $1 dollar off drinks. =/ ehhhhhsat in the booth with friends. the waiter was attentive both times. I would say  skip happy hour and go somewhere else. it's really expensive here.
Stella Y.,Los Angeles  CA,786,639,501,6/6/2012,4.0,Things I love: Happy hour!!On a lonely Monday afternoon  I grabbed a couple people for happy hour because I was craving a mojito. I got the white peach mojito which just hit the spot. It was sweet enough that you can only taste a hint of peach and mint but not too sweet that it tastes like syrup. $5 at happy hour.. I'm sold. Also got the artichoke and spinach dip ($2 off) that came out hot and gooey and big enough to share with many people. Also got 3 mini pizzas (half off)- vegetarian  3 meat  white pizza. Each incredibly good in their own way; cooked to perfection and just enough cheese. Deep dish always has a place in my stomach. One thing to note that is if you go to happy hour  it's free seating at the bar. I love how our waitress didn't even know that after we asked her. Also  service is basically non-existant. I don't mind that it's busy but try not to have me flag you down when you haven't come to my table for 15 min to take my order or give me my bill.
Maggie C.,Walnut Creek  CA,42,253,8,3/19/2012,1.0,Probably my worst dinner experience ever!I'm sure they don't care about this review as their line is constantly out the door. I guess most families will not go to Hooters which is why they are all here. Go to the food court if you must eat inside the mall. On a Friday night  we've waited 1hr 45mins for our table and we sat in one of the booth. Since we had movie tickets  we wanted to be sure we can get out of there on time. Service was slow and our server did not check on us at all. We need them to run our credit cards so that we can get outta there so we waved down another server. This rude guy refused to take it but then finally took it with an upset and annoyed look. We've ordered majorly fried food entrees thinking you can't mess that up. Boy we were wrong  they tasted they were fried while they were still frozen  it has no flavor  completely over-fried and very salty. I ordered fried shrimp and I would've guess I ate fried plastic. The cheese on their pizza chews and tastes like rubber. Is that industrial grade chhese? Gross. The appitizer sampler was $16 and came with very little food. I do not understand why people keep coming back and wait 1hr+ for food that's worst tasting than McDonald's but three times the price.
Abigail D.,San Francisco  CA,461,183,59,3/26/2012,4.0,Always been a staple for me. You can't really go wrong here. Pizzas  sandwiches  rolls  dips  and that pizookie! Oh my. I had it for the first time today and that sucker is dangerous! I probably could've eaten a deep dish sized portion to myself. I like the Oreo flavor! Nomnomnom. It's really hit or miss with the service. The wait time is highly unpredictable. It ranges from no wait to hours. So be aware. Parking can be difficult  but that's expected because it's located in a shopping center. My rec for pizza is their Great White. I get it every single time.
Panos M.,San Bruno  CA,35,42,9,9/21/2012,1.0,I'm not gonna spend too much time on this place because it's not worth it.If you want to cry  order the nachos. Last time I was at this place  our waitress came by the table at some point to ask if we needed anything. A split second later  she is on her way before I  or anyone at the table  was able to say anything.Yes I need something  how 'bout some flavor for this cardboard you served us.
Ray K.,Charlotte  NC,38,10,,10/14/2015,4.0,Stopped in at this place while at the mall. Great eatery with tons of TVs! This is a premier spot for Sunday football in the area.
Jerry W.,San Francisco  CA,153,267,172,5/29/2011,3.0,We had large party with kids  Service was quick and the servers were very attentive. The menu was large and choices were hard. This place only had Pepsi products so I have to give them 1 less star...just kidding.I ordered the Texas Style Chicken Fried Steak ($12.25). It came with steamed veggies and cheddar mashed potatoes. The steaks were a bit on the chewy side...could have used a pounding or 2 with a tenderizer. The cream sauce was peppery and had a could texture. The veggies were a bit blend  but they were fresh and not frozen  thank goodness. Just dip the veggies into some of the cream sauce. The cheddar mashed potatoes was very cheesy...really awesome and highly recommended. Just a side note  you get 2 pieces of steak with this order. The steaks were in the fryer a bit too long  coming out a bit on the dark brown side. The batter used reminded me KFC chicken...I think the Colonel might have been moonlighting.I did taste the below items:Chicken Pesto Flat Bread Pizza - not bad  good texture. The pesto was garlicky and gave the pizza a really good finish.Deep Dish Cheese Pizza - the bready crust was awesome  but the sauce was nothing to write home about.Pizookie- this is a fresh chocolate chip cookie cooked in a small deep dish pan topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The cookie was good  the chips were warm and melty. The vanilla ice cream was ... just vanilla...plain and without a bang...boring.Now for the restroom report - I went to the restroom 2 times about an hour apart. The restroom had 2 sitters and 2 standees. The floors near the urinals were wet and smelled of urine...the floors were sticky. If I dropped a $100 bill on the floor in the Men's Room...I would probably just leave it. The trash cans were full and needed emptying.
Richard H.,Fontana  CA,1,8,,9/16/2014,2.0,The maui glazed pork chop was dry and the service was slow for the restaurant not being busy on a Monday night. I have eaten at many other B.J. and normally love the pork chop.
Liz W.,Boston  MA,137,276,227,2/10/2012,2.0,PIZOOKIE!!!! & Pizza...the only 2 good things about this place.The lady at the front that seated us was so RUDE and AWKWARD. She was uninviting and when she seated us  there was greasy food on the seat. I pointed it out to her (she didn't even notice...) and she merely brushed a few pieces off with her hand. The GREASE remained. I asked if she could wipe it down  she rudely walked away came back with a NAPKIN and BARELY wiped it. The entire time she had the look of disgust and anguish on her face. The WORST customer service EVER.Thank god the food was alright  we had a pizookie  pizza  and jalapeo burger. The burger was a 2/5  pizookie 5/5 as always  and pizza 4/5. But the lady was so rude that this place just doesn't deserve a higher rating.
Lisa L.,San Francisco  CA,526,187,175,1/13/2013,3.0,I used to come here so much when I was in high school because it was so convenient and I still see a lot of high school come here as well. Mainly  it's the pizookie that gets the crowd going. I mean  what's better than a warm  delicious cookie topped with ice cream? Yea  it's so simple but so amazing at the same time. Not to mention  the portions are big enough to share so order something different. Last time I came here  I had sliders  a pizza  and the avocado rolls. OMG LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE AVOCADO EGG ROLLS ARE AWESOME. I love the dipping sauce that it comes with! Honestly  what takes away the stars is always the service. I just feel like for the amount of people I see working there  it shouldn't take as long as it does to get the food and even just water. When you have to ASK for your water instead of your waiter/waitress asking you what you'd like to drink -- that's already a minus for me  baby. If the wait is long  there's barnes and noble right across and the mall's right there if you want to shop around as well
Lindsay C.,Daly City  CA,0,10,1,3/6/2014,1.0,Called ahead of time to put our name on the list. When we arrived they told us to wait 20 minutes. A little over 20 minutes went by so I asked and they said we'd have to wait another 20 minutes. After waiting and waiting over 20 min. I asked how long and they said 15 minutes. A party of 6 of us decided to leave. It's too bad you couldn't stick to your words. Never coming back  this was ridiculous.
Priscilla W.,San Francisco  CA,219,54,341,1/13/2013,4.0,"Things that I always order because they\'re consistently awesome: - Tatonka Stout - ahi poke - calamari- piranha nachos- spinach & artichoke dip- the flatbreadsThings that I\'ve tried and am pleasantly surprised about: - Watermelon and Feta salad! It comes in ""a small bite""- spinach stuffed mushrooms- their pizza!!!! - pazookie (noms)The MEH:- avacado egg rolls  personally way too much avacado even for a single portion. The dipping sauce is it\'s redeeming factor. I\'d go with Cheesecake factory\'s avacado egg rolls- Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. I love lettuce wraps  the only thing i\'d change for theirs is the type of lettuce they use.- mini-bruschetta  don\'t get me wrong i LOVEEEE bruschetta  but this one is passable"
Lethe S.,Knightsen  CA,0,5,,10/16/2014,2.0,Food is good.Service is ok. Womens bathroom is always durty  smelly and never seems to be clean every time I had to go there. I didn't feel like eating any more after I go back to my table. Yeeeecccckkk. So disgusting! Health Hazzard!
Ligia A.,San Mateo  CA,47,37,,3/26/2012,2.0,Horrible!I am in a wheelchair and they tried to seat us in a booth  which made us have to wait another 20 minutes on top of the hour that we just waited... the manager said they would take care of our meal  they just give us a free dessert... I really do love this place  but just not this location.
Daniel D.,Concord  CA,825,461,309,11/23/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,It's been a while but I've been here more than a few times...Recently discovered their soup in bread bowls... seriously you wouldn't think that some of the best bread bowls and soup are at BJ's. If you doubt me  give the tomatoe bisque or chili a try in a bread bowl. You will not be disappointed  especially during these winter days/nights.The take out is handled separately so you're not just in with the regular people dining. When I got some soup to-go  they included all the utensils and napkins that I needed. And it was just as good as when I had it at the actual restaurant.
Miko A.,San Francisco  CA,155,92,410,2/14/2013,5.0,Me and My Buddy come here for lunch or Dinner after Movie we have a Good time you Always got Drunk But we always have a Great Time
Jenny N.,San Diego  CA,565,459,327,10/8/2012,4.0,Bjs is always Bjs. No matter which location i go to  its all gonna be the same. its just the servicing thats different. The clam chowder always hits the spot. And the Calamari is always crispy as always and yummiieee :D good place to watch sports while drinking beer too ;D
Jocelyn T.,Hercules  CA,358,781,1070,10/6/2010,3.0,Came here on a Friday night after a conference and I was famished. Usually on a Friday night especially after 8pm  the wait for a table is usually 45 min or longer so my boyfriend and I opted for the bar area to get a seat. Trying to eat healthy  I ended up ordering shrimp tacos with chips and my boyfriend ordered the deep dish pizza size S. After I wolfed down my shrimp tacos  I was still hungry so I ate some of the deep dish pizza. The pizza was actually surprisingly good. The red peppers in the shaker bottle was uber hot  just the way I like it. The only thing that made my experience lose a star was their satellite music kept going in and out because of the wind. It was quite annoying  otherwise I would come back again
Paul O.,San Jose  CA,3,18,,1/17/2014,1.0,"This individual BJ\'s is by far the absolute worst franchised resturant/bar that I have ever been to. If you are the manager  supervisor  or owner of this place - please keep reading this review  and know that you should never EVER think that you are running your business well. EVERY PART OF THE EXPERIENCE AT THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE.My girlfriend and I went here just last night  around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. It wasn\'t busy  there was no line waiting for seats  and there were open tables through the resturant. We chose to sit at the bar area  at one of the two-top tall tables  in order to get served a little more rapidly  as well as get drinks quicker. We sat  and sat  and sat  and waited  and watched as many waiters  waitresses  bussers  and pretty much everyone walked by our table. No one said anything to us about being right with us  offering us water  menu\'s  drinks  nothing. Even the bartender  who was not more than four feet away from us  who was staring right at us  NEVER asked us if we needed or wanted anything.It was seriously about 10 mins before our waitress came up to our table with menus - and no I\'m not exaggerating  the basketball game was on  we were watching it  and the full commercial breaks and more game  and more commercials  while waiting for service...When our waitress came she was very nice - this was the ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS RESTURANT.She took our drink order - my girl got some pink cadillac cocktail  and I simply ordered a dirty martini. We also asked for the fried calamari appetizer  and we\'d continue looking at the menu. When the drinks came  I sipped mine and immediately knew that someone screwed it up. I\'m going to tell you something that may come as a shock - a martini is made with GIN... NOT VODKA. If I ordered a vodka martini  then I\'d want vodka in it. When someone orderes a martini - that means GIN. Now  I understand that some people who order drinks may not know that  so it is up to the servers and barkeeps to specify gin or vodka if they think the person ordering it might be too stupid to know what is in a real martini. Also on the martini  a dirty martini means that you add some olive juice to the gin and vermouth as well  not just THREE OLIVES in the glass. (In case you were wondering  yes three olives is excessive for a martini)Now on to the calamari which came shortly after the drinks. They were overly fried (almost burned)  and not seasoned with salt at all. In fact  the breading on it was so bland it made flour look spicy. The two dipping sauces which come with calamari are supposed to be tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Guess what we were given!! MOTHERFUCKING RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE. Let me re-iterate that for you: RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE INSTEAD OF TARTAR AND COCKTAIL SAUCE.What kind of stupid ass  dumb fucks do you have plating in that kitchen?Next up our meal came. We ordered a buffalo burger and the ahi salad. When we ordered it  we asked for an extra plate so that we could split the two in half and share them. No extra plate came with our food. The dipshit that brought us the food asked us if we needed anything else  I asked for some horseradish dipping sauce  or something similar. He said no problem. He never came back.With no extra plate  I scraped the crap-salad off the plate with the burger onto a different  dirty plate (more on that later)  and we made do with the rest.The burger was mediocre at best. There was very littly ""buffalo"" sauce on the burger  only a sliver of onion on it  and a single leaf of lettuce. The patty looked like a pre-packaged patty that you tear the paper off and slap on the grill when you don\'t care about quality. In all  the burger was sub-par.The salad  which should have been stupid simple was also screwed up. The ahi  which should have had a brief sear on it  was overly seared  though at least seasoned well. What completely ruined this plate was the wasabi paste on it. Now  I can handle spice - and I love wasabi. This shit was so in-edible  that you even put a small bit on the ahi  and you are tearing up. It ruined everything that it touched. Which was awesome  because some bites of sald would not have any on it (which was nice) and others would send me looking for my non-existent water glass.Which  btw  there was no water glass. Oh  and the shit cocktails were empty just after starting the meal. Nice  huh?The kicker of all this  was the dirty ass tables directly next to us. They were piled with trash  and dirty dishes the ENTIRE TIME WE WERE THERE. They didn\'t start bussing them until we were leaving - don\'t forget that this place WAS NOT BUSY! NO EXCUSE FOR THIS.This whole experience only cost me a little over sixty dollars. I\'d like to extend a very healthy FUCK YOU to the management team and owners of this establishment for allowing this kind of stupidity and complete lack of service that we got. I hope you loose money  and go out of business."
Shannon T.,South San Francisco  CA,213,54,5,11/28/2013,1.0,"I read the negative reviews on Yelp before going to BJ\'s yesterday afternoon for lunch with a friend and her 2 kids (both under the age of 4)... I was disgusted! We sat for over 25 minutes before having to wave down a waiter to take our order and then waited another 30 minutes for it to come... In the meantime  a few of the runners delivered her son his ""mini sliders"" meal. He picked up one to begin eating and they then realized that they had brought the order to the wrong table. They took the plate back and we watched them bring it to another incorrect table before finding the correct one. I had to go and find a booster seat myself and felt the customer service was awful! I felt bad for our waiter because it was not his fault... This place is disorganized and completely unprepared for big crowds which I would imagine happens daily... I would never go back!"
Michelle M.,Belmont  CA,195,1831,599,1/14/2010,2.0,Not my favorite BJ's and that is because this place is super crowded. The back room looks lame. I went here for my work x-mas party. It just felt like we were not important  even though we equal mo money! The food is okay  feels like bar food. So it is mainly a place to get together with some people and have a drink. Nothing really big. Oh and it gets super loud here  don't expect to hear someone on the other side of the table.
Anthony S.,London  United Kingdom,0,2,,8/30/2015,1.0,Waited 45 minutes for a pickup order when I was told 15 minutes and was told it would be 10-15 more minutes.so they clearly never took my order and tried to pass it off.the manager didn't really seem to care when I told him I was going across the street to jacks.
Katarina F.,Walnut  CA,241,56,69,4/30/2014,4.0,Whenever I'm craving good simple wings  I always want to go to a bjs because their wings are super delicious! I. Would highly recommend their Oreo pizookie because it is simply to die for!
Peta B.,Walnut Creek  CA,15,34,2,3/2/2013,2.0,Within minutes of being here  it became clear that this is the type of place that does not think much of it's clientele  so the staff doesn't feel the need to try very hard. We ended up in the area and needed to grab a casual dinner. We figured  you can't go wrong with a BJ's. Well  we learned that you can.We got drinks at the bar while we waited for a table. The bartender made 4 pomegranate martinis and topped them off with a clear liquid when they came up short. I assumed the clear liquid was tequila but it turned out to be extra syrup. The drinks were unbearably sweet and a complete disaster. The service didn't get any better from there. The food was mostly ok.Skip this one. We've all experienced better!
Erica L.,San Carlos  CA,158,428,90,3/11/2012,4.0,I like their pizzas  especially the bbq chicken and great white. I recently tried their new portabello mushroom pizza and that was good too.-meatloaf! is really good here. I ordered that for the longest time  but I think i ate it too often. -fries are great here. i like both their crispy thin and wedges! so hard to decide!-artichoke dip is always great appetizer to share with friends. -BEER- im not a beer drinker but i do like BJ's light beers. Cocktails here are not worth it. its so small.-pizookie.... so Fattening!!! but so good! i love the which choc macadamian nut!!Service is okay. Sometimes too slow. This is a great sports bar  I came here one time to watch a Giants game and they let us sit there for 3 hours! But if you want to catch the game. come early to get a table  it gets pretty crazy!
Aubria T.,San Francisco  CA,44,13,14,4/8/2013,3.0,Tasty food and very reasonable prices. Sports bar type vibe. Watch the game  hang out with friends or quick bite to eat after shopping.
Phill E.,San Francisco  CA,4,64,11,1/12/2013,2.0,This place has sadly declined in quality. Tonight was the first time in several months that i had visited  and decided to order take-out for the family. We had the Mediterranean pizza  1 order of the wings  kids spaghetti with marinara sauce and kids chicken tenders. As soon as we arrived (~15 min after calling in) we were greeted by the take-out cashier  we paid for our food and went on our way.Opening the pizza box  to my dismay  was a pizza that looked very different than the ones I had ordered from there before. Quality was lacking; toppings were clumped together or spread unevenly  the edges had no form and lacked the crispiness they once had  and the pizza was barely cut. The actual key ingredients such as the chicken  were almost nowhere to be found!!! We ordered a large pizza and i could fit all of the chicken into the palm of my hand....The wings had gotten worse as well  they tasted less like chicken and more like the fryer oil they are to be cooked in. Kids meals....barely any sauce  garlic bread was hard but thank God for kids who aren't picky with their food. The kids chicken tenders were alright.Not sure if i'll return for the food if this is their new level of quality but i will return during happy hour for drinks!
Eleanor E.,San Mateo  CA,286,89,51,10/9/2012,4.0,A couple friends and I decided to come here after watching a movie on Friday morning. It wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. Our server arrived at our table at a reasonable time and asked for beverages  then about 5 minutes later he came back with our drinks. (The cream soda tastes amazing  by the way).He forgot to ring in our appetizer because I noticed that he didn't write anything down until he started taking our orders. No worries  we still wanted the calimari after our meals.Oh  and the kitchen had an extra pizookie so he gave it to us :D
Danny F.,San Bruno  CA,43,160,60,5/22/2014,2.0,"Only ""ok"" thing was my pasta & it was overprived being $15. First of have been to this restaurant many many times its either a horrible miss or a awesome hit. It doesn\'t matter my experience should be consistantly good. First of I ordered Pasta with a side wedge Salad. All our food came out at the same time & my Wedge Saled never came. Our waitress totally abandoned us didnt get it till 20 mins after I had to ask again.....Cristal P you stink at your job im sorry. It wasnt just the service that was unpleaent. The pasta lacked quantity for the hefty $15 price tag I paid. The soda didnt taste good. Which is odd cause thier soda is known for being the best. Id recommend Chillis or Maxs instead of Bjs."
Raysh P.,Mission  San Francisco  CA,21,9,1,8/5/2014,2.0,Walked in here and sat down for about 20mins before a waiter said anything to us... And when someone did come he was just walking by not even a waiter in our section.. I think his name was mike he was coo.. Let this place be your last option to eat.. Shitty service just because about 8 waiters/waitresses walked passed us without saying a word.. Except mike only why I'm giving this place 2stars.. Food was alright 4.5/10
Elisabeth S.,Napa  CA,0,1,,9/6/2015,4.0,This is our first visit to BJ's Brewhouse  we had a fabulous deep dish pizza (BJ's Favorite!) and wonderful service from our waiter  Jimmy. Jimmy absolutely made our evening with his skill and kindness. In talking my husband mentioned my birthday was last week and Jimmy gave us a celebratory pizookie a-la-mode! I had no idea what this was  but it sounded absolutely delicious (amaze-balls) and we truly appreciated the gesture. Three cheers for BJ's San Bruno - especially Jimmy! Thank you for my birthday candle!
Jamie G.,San Francisco  CA,34,45,889,10/21/2012,4.0,Sucky service but their chicken lettuce wraps and red velvet pizookie are BOMB.
Vika K.,Hayward  CA,50,12,24,8/1/2014,2.0,Service was horrible. It took our server 20 minutes to serve our drinks. Our table did not have silverware on the table. Our server was very slow  I don't know her name but she only checked up on our table twice. Appetizer (artichoke dip) was cold. They need a new manager or something. Other BJ's have better service.
Karl B.,San Francisco  CA,104,19,,4/22/2014,2.0,Food is not exciting   environment sucks. Waitress gave water to 2 other groups before serving me and my girlfriend who were seated 5 minutes before the other groups. Not a fan of this place.
Gary G.,San Diego  CA,2,2,,7/28/2015,1.0,Last night I got into SFO late so I went by this BJs for dinner. They were fairly busy so I opted for a table in the bar. After sitting there for 10 min I was finally asked if I wanted something to drink. I ordered my drink and food at the same time. Tired from traveling I did not want this to take very long. Drink and food came in a reasonable amount of time but my baked potato was cold. Hungry and tired I just ate. I noticed that the table next to mine sent several items back that were either cold or undercooked. I then waiting almost 20 min after I was done to get my check. I gave the waiter my card right away. Once I did it took another 10 min for him to bring the bill back for me to sign. At this point I just wanted to leave. In my haste  I walked off and left my sunglasses. Today I called around noon to see if I could pick them up. I called and was put on hold for nearly 20 min. Finally I hung up. I called back an hour or so later only to get put on hold again for 10 min this time. When I finally did get a response I was told that no my glasses were not found. I told them that I left them there and they should be in a lost and found. Nope. No such thing. No care or concern whatsoever that I lost them in that restaurant. I know I left them on the table so they should be there for me to retrieve. Am I wrong in this? I am disappointed at the amount of time I wasted last night  poor service  cold food  and people that just obviously don't care.
Stephanie M.,San Francisco  CA,18,95,42,2/12/2012,3.0,I love their Nutty Brewnette. It's spicy and hoppy and it makes me sneeze but I still heart it. Now for the longest run-on sentence of your life: I've tried the Spinach and Artichoke Dip (tasty  but I wish it came with bread)  Avocado Egg Rolls (good)  Original Roast Beef Dip Sandwich (solid and filling)  BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich (tasty but too much bun)  Buffalo Chicken Pizza (flavor is good but I'm not a fan of deep dish)  Spaghetti with Spicy Tomato Sauce (I add chicken)  New Orleans Jambalaya (huge portion but it's a little dry)  Miso Salmon (the citrus glaze is crazy sweet  blech)  Old-Fashioned Pot Roast (the portion could stand to be a little bigger). If your meal comes with fries  the wedges can't be missed.You know what used to taste awesome but was unceremoniously removed from the menu? The meatloaf. WHY? WHY DID YOU TAKE IT OFF THE MENU?! (A server actually told me a man became so angry it disappeared he yelled at the restaurant in general  slammed his menu on the table and stormed out. That's how good it was.)Atmosphere is typically semi-dark and bustling. Food is sorta pricey but usually portions are big. The servers are pretty on point about asking if you need help and bringing you extra stuff you ask for (aka Tabasco  more ranch  etc.). Waits can be horrendous  especially Fri-Sun when parents bring their six kids. I'll always find it strange going to places where there are giggling kids at one table and yelling single drunk chicks literally 10 ft. away. I really wish they would let me rate places half stars because I think this place is a solid 3.5.Side note: whoever designed the Tanforan parking lot needs to be punched in the balls (or the uterus  I don't want to be sexist here).
Mai H.,San Leandro  CA,179,149,38,9/24/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,My 4 stars still stands. Came here last night for dinner. We had a total of 4 adults and 3 kids and its a really good place for kids. They have crayons for the kids and beer for the adults hahaThe chicken wings here are so good! I love it!!!Cajun pasta was pretty good too. The shrimp was well flavored. The pizza has a little too much dough for me. The oreo pizookie was so good!!!! Definitely come back just for wings and pizookie!
Carnita M.,Bay Area,91,285,569,7/4/2010,2.0,"I came here on a weekday night at 7 p.m. and was told there was a 30-minute wait for tables. 30 minutes turned into 45 minutes before we were finally seated. The guy who showed us to our table seemed upbeat and apologized for the wait so I thought we were off to a good start. I was wrong.We waited a very long time (I didn\'t check my watch but believe me when I say LONG!) before our waitress came to our table to take our order. I was expecting an apology for the wait but got none at all. She was not very attentive and was hardly ever around to check in on us.As for the food  I usually get their deep dish pizza which is only average compared to other places but on this visit I decided to try their mac and cheese. It turned out to be very good and I was very pleased with my decision  though not too impressed that they brought the food to the wrong table. I ended up getting some fries too which were ok but did not seem worth the nearly $5.00 they cost! Since I was at BJ\'s I couldn\'t end my meal without a pizookie so I got my favorite  the white chunk macadamia. I usually find it so  so yummy but the flavor seemed kind of ""off"" that night. Oh yes  and the spoons we were given for our pizookie were very sticky! We had to ask for new ones.It was packed and lively in the bar area and whole restaurant and I even spotted what I would consider some eye candy yet that\'s not enough to make me return to this place."
Patricia G.,Emeryville  CA,68,324,20,10/27/2011,2.0,You know  I get it. It's a family restaurant  it's busy and all but really?? Ten minutes to get your server's attention after sitting down is not acceptable ANYWHERE. Then it takes you another 10 minutes to grab your server for extra croutons. Granted she got it to you right away but man... **woosaaahh**Lunch time? Man I hope you have more than an hour. The service doesn't get any better in the afternoon. Again  it gets busy but shouldn't you expect that? The prices obviously are almost split in half. But  if you only have an hour  you're gonna be cutting it close.Late night eats. Decent place. Price? Well  again I say  late night eats. Where else are you going to go other than the Jack in a Box drive thru? I don't mind paying the money but the service is ridiculous. Happy Hours are a plus. I think it's from 3-7p at the bar location only which is fair and then again from 10p to close. Watch out for the table stalkers  but don't worry  they just literally want your table and nothing else.Pazookie. YES. They've opened it up to quite a few more options. Made me feel like I was at cheesecake factory on which one I was going to order. Red Velvet  Oreo  Chocolate Ghirardelli Fudge... the fat list went on and on and one... must if you're up for the 1600+ calorie dessert  GO FOR IT!
 T.,Tokyo  Japan,3496,1733,23353,7/30/2007,3.0,I left this place completely happy and satisfied for a weekend lunch. Yet  as I was walking out  I said solid 3 stars. Oh but wait  what more could this place offer to get 4 or 5 stars? They had:Nice outdoor patio seatingQuality TV monitors (saved me once during the NFL playoffs).Fantastic beer tasting dealAwesome nachosGood serviceSpacious seatingWell  restaurant looks and feels like a chain restaurant - because IT IS a national chain.But so what? Who cares? If I had a good time  why not give them more stars?Hmmmmmm...that's true. They don't have any gourmet food  but that's okay for a brewery. They just need to have pizza  burgers  nachos  etc. that goes well with beer.PIZZA: One solid criticism I could give is that their so-called Chicago Style pizza is not really Chicago style. There is too much bread for the amount of topping. One here is much like Uno's Pizza  which I also don't consider to be true Chicago style pizza. So they probably deserve more than 3 Stars  but what the heck  I'll give them 3.
Samantha M.,San Francisco  CA,457,55,52,4/29/2014,4.0,I really like the food & beer/ drink selection. If you're hungry & in a hurry don't come here though. Unless you're lucky to snag a seat by the bar  the wait is usually long. Both for a table & for the service. The staff is generally friendly though so that makes up for some of it  & the food & drink options make up for the rest of it. If you work up an appetite shopping or want to snag a happy hour at the mall  it's a good option. I usually just get an appetizer & a drink or two. Wines  beer  martinis  all good options.
Bryan L.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,27,41,1/24/2014,1.0,this was the second worstest restaraunt experience i ever had.first  do they not clean there forks  knives and plates?every single one was greasy and had some kind of marks on it. asked waitress to replace it. it was still dirty.ended up using napkins and glass of water to clean them.also every drink we ordered also had greases all over the cup and the drinks.seriously  do u guys not clean them at all?me and my friends just walked out
Paula M.,El Cajon  CA,26,3,,8/13/2014,1.0,My family and I waited over an hour for a table that was supposed to be available in 30 minutes only to be greeted by the ditziest waitress I've ever had the displeasure of encountering in a food establishment. She took the drink order and then popped by 10 minutes later to say the drinks would be right up  implying that someone else was delivering them. But no  it was her  another 10 minutes later. When she finally took the food order  it started to arrive before we had silverware. I asked for silverware and a glass of ice. She came by to check on us a while later  but didn't bring the silverware or the ice  so we reminded her again  and she asked how many we needed  unbelieveable! She couldn't see? or couldn't count? The food was marginal at best  but it's the lack of service that will keep me from ever returning. This was the first time in my 50+ years that I didn't leave a tip.
E P.,Atherton  CA,0,54,,7/9/2015,4.0,This is a good place for a business lunch. They have a pretty extensive menu. I usually order a salad and go during off hours  so I don't know if they get really busy. I never have to wait for a table after 1:30. I recommend.
Christi S.,San Francisco  CA,131,275,199,3/7/2014,3.0,"Nothing to rave about. Typical restaurant joint like all the other chains. I guess the best is that they have happy hour. But definitely ""call ahead"" is the way to go if you\'re trying to make reservations for parties less than 6."
Kelly Y.,San Francisco  CA,217,9,,8/6/2014,2.0,"It is what it is... I got the ""deep dish"" pizza which is more like a thick crust/pan pizza. Most deep dish pizzas have a lot of sauce  but the depth was mostly created by more bread :/The soup/salad combo seemed like the best deal."
Michal W.,Burlingame  CA,1,7,,6/25/2013,5.0,Eating here for years-certified GF menu! Just had the best Ribeye steak ever (perfectly seasoned and cooked!)-I ate at 615pm-prime time and packed. But was greated in 2 minutes and given super service by Brandon T-he notified a Floor Manger I had ordered GF-who oversaw the prep of the dish-dinner got to me in under 15 minutes during their busiest time-you guys always do it right!!See you soon-Michal
Lisa R.,Daly City  CA,4,36,,12/11/2013,1.0,If you're going here to watch a game  just eat somewhere else before you go  even if you go through a fast food drive through you'll be better off. I'd been here a few times before this most recent dismal experience  so I knew to keep expectations low  but it was so bad I just have to warn people. My boyfriend wanted to go somewhere to watch a game that wouldn't be on our home channels. Just stick with beer for drinks. My bf ordered a margarita that was so bad  it tasted like the cheapest powered lemonade mix and tasted so weird and artificial he sent it back for a mojito which also tasted like a cheap mix and you could tell they didn't muddle it  just threw a few mint leaves in there. The food was worse; it seems worse every time I go to a BJ's. Everything tasted like it had been sitting under a warmer for at least an hour. My fish tacos were basically tortillas with some gross mayonaise sauce  and the grilled fish was one piece about as big as my pinky finger. No kidding  it was like they put one really tiny fish stick in each taco. No flavor. Served with that awful fake guacamole  just horrible. The server was trying to get us out as fast as possible because it was busy. She pushed for our dessert order while my bf was still eating his meal.I will never go back to BJ's ever again if I can help it.
Katie W.,San Francisco  CA,47,14,,2/16/2013,2.0,"Bj\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse used to be a lot better; however  in the last few months  it seems they have dropped the ball in the service department.First off  I do love the actual facility as far as set-up  decor  and atmosphere. It always seems to be packed with patrons and the hosts at the front are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately  the service here has gotten pretty crappy lately. My go to items to order are the California Club pizza & the Red Velvet Pazzokie. Both are usually great. My fianc and I have eaten there/ordered food from there maybe 4 times in the last 3 months. The last time I ordered the California club pizza there was extra flour caked onto the bottom of my pizza  it was gross. Service was alright. 3rd to last time we were in there was the worst. We dinned in at the Brewhouse this night. It took 5 minutes for us to even be greeted by our server  who then disappeared for an additional 5 minutes without even taking our drink order. After sitting there for 15+ minutes  we finally ordered drinks. My fianc ordered a steak and I ordered shrimp kabobs and a lobster tail. When our food arrived  mine was cold. Now I\'ve been a server at numerous restaurants and I know how tough the job is  and it takes a lot for me to actually complain about something. This is the first time I have ever actually had to ask the waitress to take my food back to be warmed up. My fianc was nearly finished with his food before I got to begin eating mine. Thats just not acceptable when you\'re spending $80+ on a dinner at BJ\'s (which is a lot for this place). We clearly weren\'t a priority on this night.2nd to last time  was mid december of 2012. We ordered the curbside take-out for the first time. It was simple enough to order online and the wait time wasn\'t too long. We ordered a personal pizza  the meatball app.  and the gormet Mac n\' cheese. I was very disappointed with the mac n\' cheese. The bacon in the mac n\' cheese was burnt to a black crisp. It tasted disgusting! The worst part  is that someone clearly didn\'t care that they were putting charcoal into my dinner... I tried to pick out as much of the bacon as I could and tried to eat around it.The last time we ordered food was Feb. 14th  2013. We ordered the curbside take out again online. We ordered about $45+ of food  including one of their baked potatoes. When my fianc went to pick up the food about 40 minutes later  he arrived to find out they had no potatoes left. They had made the rest of the food; however  never called to inform us that we needed to choose a substitute  so I didn\'t get dinner. My dinner ended up being the pizookie  they gave us for free (which we had already ordered) to make up for it. There is no excuse for not calling to get a substitute choice  for 40 minutes! Seems as though this place may have a high turn-over rate of servers. Whatever the problem is  I\'m to the point where I\'m simply going to go over to Jack\'s for dinner. They have never gotten our orders wrong  left us sitting at the table with no greeting  and the food is always great & also affordable! BJ\'s needs to step up their game  they are displaying a message of ""We are trying to accomodate for more patrons than we can handle  so some may suffer."" Not worth it to me."
Marty And D M.,South San Francisco  CA,0,10,,8/4/2014,1.0,Hand tossed pizza was a cracker not good not everyone wants to eat deep dish how about just a good ole pizza thick crust. Bj`s call up a pizza parlor or visit one and see if you can learn how to make pizza. I'd say beer is not that big of a deal youcan go anywhere and find beer. Your menu is deceiving the picture shows a hand tossed pizza with a nice crust NOT!!!. you`ll make a lot of money listening to thepublic.
Lily W.,San Francisco  CA,117,9,,10/24/2013,3.0,"I came here twice in one week because of a Google Offer deal that offers a 3 course meal for 2 for $19.95. (It\'s still going on. Expires: Nov. 11. 2013) The 3 courses include your choice of soup/salad  medium pizza  and a pizookie! What a steal! First time:Although I wasn\'t really in the mood for pizza  I was excited to eat at BJ\'s for the first time because I have been wanting to try the much raved about pizookie. My verdict after the meal: it was just....ok.FOOD:Soups: Clam chowder and Mexican tortilla. Before I mention taste...why was my soup lukewarm? It should be hot! On to taste:Clam chowder was tasty and had nice chunks of clams. Mexican tortilla was too salty. Pizza: Deep dish BBQ Ranch chicken. I don\'t like dip dish  but the pizza was pretty good.I actually wouldn\'t even call it deep dish  because it was more of a thick bread with a semi-thick topping. Pizookie: Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top. I can see why people like it because it was tasty  but it was way too sweet for me. I couldn\'t finish it. DRINKS:Beer: 8 samplers  including the seasonal pumpkin flavored beer. They make their own beer! My favorite was the oasis and blondie  while my sister liked the piranha. SERVICE:Where is my water??? My server seemed to have forgotten to bring my table water  so I asked the next server walking by for some water. He jokingly commented: ""So you must be thirsty"" before leaving to get my water ""Uhhh  yeah I\'m thirsty. I have been sitting here for over 10 minutes without water"" is what I said in my head. He came back with ONE cup of water while my sister sitting across from me eyed me with disbelief. You\'re kidding me  right?!Another thing is that the waiter forgot to bring our to-go boxes after our meal. He only brought our boxes over after he saw my sister eyeing him with boxes in hand for another table while walking by. Despite the mediocre service and food  I went back two days later with my sister and parents because it\'s still a good deal! The second time around  the food was still mediocre but the service was much better. Our server was very attentive despite making some mistakes. She gave us the wrong order. We ordered the BBQ chicken hand-tossed pizza and realized it was the buffalo chicken pizza after taking a bite  but we decided to keep it anyway since we already took a big chunk from the pizza. She also forgot to apply the discount at the end  but she realized her mistake before I spoke when she saw my phone in hand and apologized for it. We forgave her for her mistakes because our food came in a timely manner  she made sure we were enjoying our food and cleaned up the extra plates taking up space on the table without asking. As for the food that day  there isn\'t much to add  except to GET THE CRISPY POTATO SKINS!! I A bit pricey for an appetizer  but I loveee potatoes and these were perfect! Overall  I probably will come here only when there is a deal."
Rose E.,San Francisco  CA,0,13,,8/1/2015,1.0,I've been coming Bj's since was newly open  I used to love this place  but now everytime I eat here the service and the food is getting worse. I will not come to Bj's again.
Tiff T.,San Bruno  CA,26,9,10,5/3/2014,1.0,This place sucks so bad. Our server was slow. Didn't know our order. He was more confused than us. Our food took 40 minutes to come and when it did  our entree was not complete AT ALL. We told the server that it wasn't what we ordered and that the picture on the menu didn't match what we got. He was still really slow and had no clue what we were talking about. The calamari was cold and soggy. The food was cold as well. I just wanted to come in at 10:30pm for a late snack after a long day to relax and this happened  resulting in ruining my whole night. Never again will I come here. Educate your servers. And tell them to give better customer service.
Rachel A.,San Francisco  CA,131,486,14,5/16/2010,3.0,The food isn't anything to rave about...except...of course...the PIZOOKIES!!! Those things are to die for.Anyways  we had a pretty ridiculous experience tonight. The waiters knocked over our water glasses  spilling water all over us and our table  TWICE in one night! It wasn't the end of the world  it's just water  but I just couldn't believe it happened twice. And then after they knocked water on my friend  she very politely asked for a refill...which they totally forgot about.HOWEVER  the managers were really wonderful to us. Most of our food and drinks were comped  and they continued to stop by our table every 10 minutes or so just to apologize and ask how we were doing. I liked that they cared enough about our business to take the time  especially on a very crowded Saturday night (and we hadn't even spent that much money). Also  the Call-ahead service is amazing! You can just call them  ask about the wait  and have your name added to the list. We checked in when we got there and only waited 10 minutes! The best thing is the Barnes & Noble  because you can just browse the store while you wait. I didn't love getting cold water dumped on me  but the managing staff and the pizookies saved the day.
Jasnoor S.,Brentwood  CA,0,6,,2/6/2016,1.0,If I could leave zero stars I would. Our server was extremely rude. First  she told us that she would be right back to take our order and didn't come back until 20 minutes later to take the order. Not to mention  it took an additional 30 minutes for the food to come to us and when it did it was undercooked. The rice in my meal was basically raw. The server never once came back to ask for refills and only refilled after we asked for it. Then when we ordered our dessert but then realized we wanted to change it she told us she had already put the order in and couldn't change. She then comes back another 10 minutes later asking what we wanted instead because she canceled the order. I don't understand why she didn't do that in the first place when we asked her in the first place 10 minutes ago instead of waiting so long to cancel it. Not to mention the entire time we were there  she had an attitude and even brought us the bill before asking if we wanted any dessert. I've been to this location multiple times and recent decent service but this was unacceptable.
Frances T.,South San Francisco  CA,2,5,5,4/29/2014,1.0,So it was my birthday with friends and our food was freshly served  like you can see the steam from the pizza and everything. But waiter forgot our spare plates  so we waited like 10 minutes for them  thinking that we would get clean  newly washed plates. NO WRONG. We were served forks with chunks of spare food on it  plates with ketchup and mustard on it  and napkins that had stains on it. Let me add  it was not a busy day. Service was slow and the pizza was way too oily almost as if they drenched it and made it soggy.
Michael B.,Union City  CA,44,12,21,12/28/2013,3.0,Although the food is satisfactory and the pizookies are excellent as always  the hostess lost our reservation and forced my party to wait an extra 30 min  despite us calling in an hour ahead of time. Not only this  she did not put in an effort to resolve the issue  and whisked us away as if some nuisance. Umm ok?
Lisa K.,San Francisco  CA,85,1024,20,5/8/2012,2.0,We had take out at a work event  so I didn't have to deal with a wait  but also didn't get to have beer. The food has a fairly nasty Applebeeish vibe to it - everything is saltier and greasier than it needs to be. I personally found the 'pizookie' to not be worth eating and the avocado eggrolls were an abominable waste of an oddly decent avocado. The best I can say might be that the jambalaya was edible. I'll avoid this restaurant in the future.
Cameron M.,Auburn  AL,0,20,2,5/21/2015,1.0,I had the worst service experience of my life here. Our waitress announced halfway through our meal that she was going on break. I had to chase down the new waiter assigned to us to be served. The food was mediocre. The only thing that redeemed the experience at all was the pizookie I had. I would suggest trying that to-go or at another location.
Lindsey S.,Danville  CA,2,20,3,6/20/2014,1.0,"Walked into this place and the hostesses were talking and cussing about the people who came in before me who asked to be seated in certain section. After we got sat  our waitress didn\'t come over for 13 minutes to ask for our drink orders. She apologized for the wait but she was complaining about another table being a pain for her.When she served my salad... There were missing ingredients. The balsamic glaze was missing from my balsamic salad....? Along with no silverware. My husband started eating with his hands because he was so hungry and it took a good 5 minutes for me to get a fork after I had already received my salad. Then our pizza came out.... It was dough. We sent it back and apologized for being ""that person"". The manager came and brought a cooked pizza for us and didn\'t even say a word. There was no apology for the kitchen or the staff. The waitresses are walking around with their shirts untucked and talking to each other about their tables at the computers when people were waiting for drink refills. They gave us our check  finally... And then there were two pizzas on there...? We sent it back and waited 15 more minutes for them to process our check because the manager was the only one who could comp it off... But the manager  William  was busy. I would have at least figured they would comp off some of the meal or at least offer....? Considering they made is late to pick up someone from the airport because it took 20 more minutes to cook a new pizza the RIGHT way. Needless to say.... It was a terrible experience and there was no organization. There were several tables unhappy about the service and we will not return. Worst BJS I have ever been to. My familyIs in the restaurant business and the major problem with this location is the management. William  specifically  was a terrible manager."
Leanne K.,San Francisco  CA,268,78,1188,1/17/2010,3.0,"I\'ve been here since it first opened when they were giving out free meals to train their wait staff. All the waiters have changed and I think they need another training session. That\'s probably the worst part about it  some of the staff are just rude  I don\'t need someone to be passive-aggressive. It\'s almost like there\'s too much going on  they are overloaded and they don\'t care anymore either. The line  the wait to actually sit down is horrible. Be ready to wait an hour or longer. Yesterday we got there at 5:25pm  sat at 6:10pm. We thought 5:25 was early  we kind of beat the rush that came after us. Even if you aren\'t hungry  go early you\'ll still have to wait  by the time you sit you\'ll be starving.TIP: get a pager and stand by the bar if your party is willing to sit there  they have a row of cushioned seats and tall tables that you can sit at. If you see a party almost done  go stand next to that table and SWOOP once they get out from their seats. It\'s brutal. You don\'t have to wait to be seated if you sit there. Then give the pager back and say you found a seat at the bar. Then you\'re covered just in case.Ok  now to the food. I had their New BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich which was really good. When i first saw it  it was covered in beer battered onion rings  I was thinking  ""where\'s the pork?"" It was there  good flavor and it\'s big. Served with a fresh coleslaw and either wedge-cut or skinny fries. Sister got my usual  the Angel Hair Toscana with chicken (or shrimp). The pasta is good here. if you aren\'t in to oil  don\'t order pasta  it\'s very shiny  if you know what I mean. Very big portions so come ready to eat.Friends got the Jambalaya and the Cajun Pasta. Friend said the Jambalaya was too salty. From the bite that I took  it was eh  nothing popped in my mouth. The Cajun pasta was very shiny but my friend wasn\'t impressed. After awhile he thought it was too spicy. Depending on your tolerance for spicy food.Oh the handcrafted root beer here is good. It\'s not so carbonated and you get free refills. If you like carbonation this isn\'t the drink for you. If you want beer but you can\'t choose from their selection  just get the sampler  you get to try everything (I think 6)  about 6 oz or more of each. It might be a lot so if you have friends  share with them.In the end we ordered the Trio Pizookie. Three mini pizookies so we could try the flavors. We got the Chocolate Chunk  White Macadamia  and the Triple Ghiradelli Chocolate. After eating all the food before I\'m glad we ordered the minis. Between 5 of us that was good for us  but it depends on how much your party wants  if you\'re still not full and you love desserts get the regular size or share the party platter (HUGE). I always come back  but not that often  but if you want to watch a sports game or just hang out at the bar  it\'s a fun place. It\'s pretty loud in there too  so be aware if you wanted something more intimate  this isn\'t your place."
Durty D.,San Francisco  CA,3,41,20,10/13/2014,5.0,I've been here several times cause it's so close to my current residence. I've had the Shrimp Scampi  Parmesan Crusted Chicken  and a few pizzas. Do yourself a favor and ignore the calorie count for everything. I have always had worthy service at this location. On two occasions I had an older gentleman as a server when I was seated in the back and he was on point both times. I once got a younger awkward kid who hadn't been a server very long  or so it seemed. The large amount of TV's airing the 49ers game made up for it. I also had a new server named Lisa recently who was the brightest and bubbliest person I've encountered in a while! She was great not only as a server  but as a person to talk to while waiting for drinks and my meal. Hope you get her as a server if you dine here soon. Definitely a place to checkout if you want to watch different sporting events that are all airing at the same time (thanks to the massive amount of televisions).
Oliver D.,San Francisco  CA,87,68,58,10/29/2009,4.0,YES! I'm a fan! And yes this place is a mainstream kinda restaurant  but they have pretty good food! Not everything on the menu is worthy of my praise but I gotta say  the deep dish pizzas are not too bad! The chicken wings are tasty  but the reason why I go here is for the dessert! CAN you say PIZOOoooooKieeee! If it's your first time here and you appreciate the pleasures of beer  its wise to try their beer sampler. My only complaint about this place is that it gets really crowded during dinner hours with a usual wait time of 30 minutes.
Raquel B.,South San Francisco  CA,1,6,,7/13/2015,1.0,From the I wish I was elsewhere and I'm gonna let everyone know that hostess to the can I take your check yet waitress I was reminded yet again why I barely go there..at least the food was decent this time....
Renata P.,San Francisco  CA,210,79,1,9/29/2012,3.0,Ok the fact I expect a manufactured experience in any chain aside... The pot roast was pretty good minus the fact the vegetables were undercooked. The meat was tender. The sauce flavor filled. If they had only cooked the vege's in with the meat it would have been perfect. Instead it was sad. I had a cocktail with my meal. The black raspberry margarita.... It was an interesting flavor which could have used less squirts of the manufactured raspberry syrup. I would have preferred they made their own syrup actually. Yes my palette can tell the difference. Overall an ok experience. If in the area again I might come back.
Hank Z.,San Francisco  CA,8,36,,4/12/2014,1.0,Typical meet place. Cannot recommend it if you want to have an adult conversation. Music too loud and it forces everyone to speak loudly. Food is no different from any other chain eatery. Had reservations for 6 pm finally got seated at 6:45! We had a party of 5 and requested a booth in the outside mall area be cause it was quieter. We were willing to wait a bit. But as we were waiting for the staff to get our menus another staff person walked past our party and seated 2 people in a large both. All they could do was say sorry and told us had to wait for another booth to open. We ended sitting in the noisey area. No attempt was made to make us feel as we were important. Never going there again. Just let the children have it.
Jessica M.,San Francisco  CA,48,121,288,2/3/2014,4.0,Saturday night around 7pm...Talk about lucky. People were standing out in the mall  spilling outside the doors and impatiently waiting in the front of the restaurant staring at the hostess'. I walked right in  scoped the bar with the high cocktail tables and waited like a buzzard for a couple I saw paying their bill. 4 minutes later I was sitting down..ahhh...Larissa was our waitress..and was very busy but being a former waitress and also previously working for a BJ's I gave it an extended amt of time from the required 2 minute greeting. Had something different than I normally would. Typically the apps and pizza's are the homerun but we saw a salad on the table next to ours and wanted to eat it  so we ordered our own. Except it came out completely bare. Just tomatoes  it was weird. I mean I just ordered it straight off the menu so I guess it was the expeditors fault for not looking at what they were grabbing off the line. So I was patient  it's very important to be patient! =)So it came back with a few more ingredients but still not as the menu has it being prepared. It was a bummer but after mentioning it to Larissa she quickly explained it to the manager who then quickly came to our table to express his apologies for the mix-up. When we rc'vd the bill the salad was taken off. They didn't mention it  just did it. So that was nice and appreciated!!I didn't get a POOZKIE but have many other nights and shifts but ya gotta if you like warm cookies..it's simply sinful.
Kelly L.,Daly City  CA,0,12,4,7/7/2015,5.0,My experience at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was a terrific one. I invited my family to a dinner here last Friday. My experience with the food and customer service was excellent. Our waiter  Leo  was very patient and friendly. He smiled all the time and for the most part  he made sure that all of our concerns were taken care of. For example  we were worried because the pasta did not come out after about 30 minutes  however our pizza was already out. He made sure that the pasta came out and got to us. I admired him a lot because he had to tolerate my aunt who complained about the salad and mostly everything  which I give him props to. The deep dish pizza (BBQ chicken) was tasty as usual and the pasta (ravioli) was also good. By the end of this experience  I was pretty full  but as usual  we had to order the pizookie. The pizookie the best part of the whole food experience. The wonderful warm feeling of that awesome buttery cookie was just so yummy and delicious that it made my taste buds explode (not literally). And the combination of a warm cookie freshly baked with some vanilla ice cream just created such an experience that words not describe. I would be glad to go back to this place. Hopefully at least once  you will get Leo as your server.
Michael M.,San Francisco  CA,112,11,42,3/18/2014,2.0,"Maybe I set my sights a little high for ""mall food"" but when I order a hot dip or French fries  I expect them to be hot  and when I send it back to be reheated  don\'t stir it and put it back in front of me just as cold. Beers were okay  and atmosphere and presentation reminded me of a slightly upscale houlihans. I\'ll skip it next time."
Ashley L.,Clayton  CA,1,3,,7/3/2014,1.0,Food wasn't great. They forgot to bring out one of our kids meals and we got it after all the rest of us were done eating. No drink refills the whole time we were there. Wasn't impressed.
Casey K.,Half Moon Bay  CA,2,5,,5/1/2014,3.0,Cons: - Don't come here hungry. You're gonna be waiting for a while. I've been to this place a few times  and I usually have to wait an average of 10-20 minutes to be seated.- Aside from a few dishes  most of the food is highly processed frozen/pre-made chain food. (Think TGI Fridays but with better beer...)Pros: - The menu is large... so if you are grabbing some dinner with a group of friends  it's an easy choice.- The staff is always friendly.
Cupcake 1.,San Francisco  CA,2,77,14,3/14/2014,3.0,I absolutely love this restaurant  the only problem is that the staff sucks. They are literally a hot mess and do not know customer service. We went here a month ago and we have a 5 and a half month old  they made us wait an hour and a half!!!!! Their excuse was because the baby chair is a safety hazard!!!!! That's ridiculous I could of put her seat in the booth next to me! Anyways we spoke with the manager and he gave us our meals for free due to the inconvenience! Besides that  the food is great!
Paulina F.,San Francisco  CA,139,239,714,3/24/2008,4.0,The food selection is good. I'm very pleased with the clam chowder  baked potatoes  and scampi pasta. It's a brewery. You can get alcohol  if you're in the mood. Customer service is superb. I don't like the noise level. Cozy  this place isn't.
Kristine K.,San Francisco  CA,181,108,113,6/22/2011,4.0,Their grilled chicken pasta is so good! I love how they give a generous portion so that you always have leftovers. Their pizookies are to die for and the service is great. There are TV's all around so that you'll never miss a game.
Richard L.,San Bruno  CA,14,12,,4/2/2014,1.0,Some of the worst service we've ever had. We waited for someone to take our order for over 20 minutes before we had enough and walked out. Nobody even came by our table to order drinks  or at the bare minimum let us know they were running behind. Shoddy service = Two less patrons.
John F.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,1,11/16/2014,1.0,Was told the wait was 20minutes and it turned to an hr and others just walking in were being seated before us. I don't mind waiting but my 1 yr old can't. Not cool.
Ashley J.,Dallas  TX,78,269,39,5/29/2012,2.0,I love BJ's Restaurants... just not this one.The food is always a solid bet and the beer is fantastic. I love the atmosphere  especially when a local team is playing and the games are on. I was there for lunch on Memorial Day Monday and seriously waited 15 minutes for WATER. It was another 10 minutes for a pint of beer. It was busy  but not out of control busy so the fact that it was 35 minutes for our food to come out was basically unacceptable.
Yolanda L.,San Francisco  CA,6,36,184,8/24/2012,4.0,I love coming here for happy hour! $5 mini pizzas and 1/2 off appetizers! For appetizers  I recommend: wings  avocado wraps or calamari! Or the sampler!I always leave this place pretty full and satisfied. I only docked a star because sometimes service can be hit or miss.
Gibson J.,Daly City  CA,56,38,9,10/7/2012,1.0,Food service has taken a huge downfall. Instead of explaining my very long story I will say this briefly. Orders came in cold  the lettuce wrap was soggy. The wrap could of been on the hot plate for a while  who knows. We ordered our drinks but it came in a dirty glass. Who serves Remy in a dirty glass? I suppose this establishment. And if you ask them to switch glasses  they give you an excuse to order a new one. Why? You serve us a dirty glass you should give us a new glass  not make us pay for a new drink. Why do you switch waiters during a service  and having the second person covering not having a clue what we ordered? Apparently this place since they can't remember anything you ordered.they do now remember what you ordered  serving you cold food  and making you wait a very long food. And asking for a check... Really it takes 30 min for it?Well  with that rant out of the way... The food is either hit or miss... But the service... what happened? It is just awful. And yes  we got the manager involved and he comped a lot of our stuff. But it still doesn't excuse the fact the waitress wanted us to pay for a new Remy when it was served in a dirty glass. That is just inexcusable.
Jeremy C.,South San Francisco  CA,60,26,,2/5/2012,3.0,Do you like waiting an hour and a half for a table? Well if you do  then you have found the perfect spot for dinner! Don't worry  if they tell you that you're table will be ready in 30 minutes  you'll get to wait 90 instead. Gives you plenty of time to go to the Asian store a few stores down and rub some Buddha belly.As for the actual restaurant  we got put in the back on a Friday night. The waitress was very busy and before getting our drinks or taking our orders  she kept reminding us that she was very busy and would take longer to do her job.I ordered a pizza and a cream soda. The cream soda is BJ's own concoction which costs $2.99. The trick is  drink as much as possible. The idiots that I ate with also ordered drinks but only got maybe 1 refill. I got 3 refills so my cost per glass turned out to be only 75 cents. It's like printing cash.The pizza was ok. I shared a large with a friend and there were a few slices left over. On that topic  when someone says a couple  what number does that represent? I always thought a couple meant 2  but having that discussion  other people said that they think a couple stands for 3. I think they are morons. End of story.Oh....for the pizza  the waitress couldn't find Parmesan cheese.I don't come here often but when I do  I always regret it.
Alexis E.,Sacramento  CA,0,10,7,4/20/2015,2.0,Tonight a friend and I decided to go to this BJ's to have dinner. I primarily visit BJ's when I am home in Southern California and love it so I decided to give this location a try. Big mistake. It was a little crowded which I expected for a Sunday evening so we had about a 20 minute wait time to be seated which was not bad. Everything from that point was downhill. We ordered an appetizer and each ordered a small pizza we waited for about 35 minutes when a manager came out and told us that the pizzas were all taking about 20 minutes longer than normal. So  we waited. Our server hardly came to check on us and when she did we felt very rushed to finish our food. She kept asking us about dessert before we were done eating our food. The Pepsi that we had was extremely flat. We finally ordered dessert  two pizookies. Those took about 30 more minutes to come out and after someone other than our server brought them out our server came and told us she was sorry that the pizookies were also taking longer than normal. Overall  the experience was horrible and I will not be going back to this location. I will stick to going to BJ's in Southern California.
Meghan M.,Spring  TX,103,30,35,4/14/2012,3.0,This BJs is a hit and miss for me however my friends and I love coming here to unwind and relax after a long day at work. Last I came here was last week with my sis priscilla and we only ordered our fave pizookies that we were craving so much that week. This place is a great spot to watch sports and talk smack about our boyfriends ha. Lol jk but the staff is so-so  sometimes you get the waiter who disappears for twenty minutes and then remembers to take your order or the one who never comes back to give you a refill or you get the waiter thats on top of her shit ready to order you up a storm lol. so like I said.... hit or miss. Foods awesome never had a complaint... sometimes its crazy packed but what bjs isnt? And prices are reasonable. I Loooove their pizookies and the stuffed mushrooms. My usual is the grilled chicken pasta or the turkey club. If I am feeling like a fatty I will order the rack of pork ribs. Any way cool place to be with your best friends or fam. The one time I drove over here alone to get a bite to eat was my last because I had some old dude insist that he take me out after lunch and insisted that he walk me back to my car ....that for sure wont ever happen again...but if you decide to come alone thats cool too. 3 stars because the service isnt always on point.
Oleg H.,San Francisco  CA,207,552,28,2/27/2010,3.0,"""BJ? Sure.""I cant really be too negative here because everything met a certain level of quality. But definitely lacks authenticity  and reeks of corporate try hardism. What else can i say about a restaurant that bills itself as a brewery  has giant brewing vats all over the interior  but trucks its actually microbrewed beer from the more suburban country side locales where real estate\'s cheaper? Certainly holds the candle to the likes of TGI fridays and Chillis."
Amy A.,West Covina  CA,6,18,,2/27/2014,1.0,Horrible food and service. The food always comes out cold and ugly. The service takes forever even when its not busy. Every time I come here  im always disappointed. But I have to come here cuz its the only one thats close by. They need to hire new workers asap.
Rob H.,Pacifica  CA,0,3,,11/3/2014,1.0,I have only written one other review on here but this needed to be done. This will be and last time I will go here. TookMy wife here for lunch. Worst service and food. We sat down and I ordered the classic burger cooked med and my wife ordered the unlimited soup and salad. After a few mins my burger came out  waitress drops it on the table and left. No can I get you mustard or ketchup. anything? Just walked away. Let us sitting there for another 20mins waiting for my wife's soup and salad. No other wait staff would stop for us when we tried to flag the employees down for help Finaly was able flag down the hostess and ask for her order. She said she would ask the manager. ( just want the food) finally after another 10mins out comes my wife's food. The different girl drops it on the table and asked if she wants anything else and stats to walk off as I ask for ketchup. It didn't end there. But now to the food  soup was cold  salad was warm  burger was well done ( order was for med) and bun was stale and hard. we didn't complain we just ate. Waitress never came back to ask for anything else  wife had to flag down another waitress to get a refill for her soup ( menu said unlimited!?!?) got attitude for that as well. Waitress wouldn't get more salad for her   and we had to wait another 15 mins to get the bill. After we go it we waited 10 mins before we decided to just pay cash   since nobody would come and get out credit card. Worst food and waste of time ever. Don't go here
Marc W.,Chicago  IL,77,286,,10/21/2011,2.0,The best part about this place is the beer. I ordered one of their samplers and liked most all of the beers. I ordered a hamburger with fries. The meat of the hamburger was rather industrial (pre formed  pre frozen in disc form) so I didnt think much of that. Plus it took a good 45 minutes to come out. Fries were good though  nice and crispy.The service was characterized by young servers trying hard and doing a pretty good job.
Denis A.,Berkeley  CA,73,169,788,6/9/2012,3.0,My grandma loves the fish n chips here  so we come to dine everytime we visit. Usually they are able to accomodate our party of seven including two kids  a 4 yr old.and 18 month. Our last visit didn't turn out so great with a table. That being said the servers are all kind. The beers are extremely tasty too.The ribs were a huge disappointment and the calzone I had on my last visit was ok. I hope to try their deep dish pizza next  but I have yet to try a dish that is incredible. They do have a huge menu so I'm bound to connect with something.
J B.,San Francisco  CA,4,9,1,4/4/2014,1.0,Went to BJs to watch the warriors tonight.. Super packed as always. We ordered the regular BJs favorite pizza-- this was no favorite. The pizza was raw! Looked done so we eat a slice wondering -is this what it's supposed to taste like? Wasn't sure but no one was around to say anything so I continued eating. We let the waiter know who happily took it away. The pizza got comped but I'm left with a crazy stomach ache. Wish I could take it all back!! Good waiter and management did what was right  but take this as a warning! Rush hour means rushed food !
S B.,San Francisco  CA,7,89,6,2/14/2014,1.0,Mediocre take on the classic brewhouse. Menu items are boring and tired. The place is in a mall and often busy but dont let that fool you. Its main competition to the captive audience is a mall food court.
Jacqueline L.,Daly City  CA,2,4,,12/13/2012,2.0,Well This BJ's is not very good.I've been there twice and the first time I went it was disappointing for several reasons one of them being bringing me 3 sides of smiley fries in one plate for a total of 6 smiley fries!!!One I mention it to the waitress she said she would bring some more but that never happened.Second time I went I asked for a plate and they gave me a dirty one I told the waitress the plate was dirty and she just said: 'oh'  and that's it no I'm sorry or anything.I've been to different BJ's and liked them but this one is not one of them.
Anna T.,South San Francisco  CA,61,39,15,5/22/2012,3.0,The food here is decent  I've never had an actual food complaint. However  I do come here at night after work (after 10pm) and the wait is pretty terrible.The food is okay  nothing amazing. Happy hour is awesome  but service and waiting to be seated is pretty bad. Especially if you are at the first come first serve bar area. They usually forget to give me a menu and then after we hunt down menus for ourselves  it takes another 20 minutes before they get our orders and then another 20 for the food to show up. If I knew of many other options for late night dining  I'd be elsewhere for sure. I am hungry at after work!
Danielle Cheri R.,San Leandro  CA,27,16,,6/20/2011,2.0,Took my daddy here for an early Father's Day dinner (Friday night). There was no wait which was surprising to me  then again there was only two of us. Our waitress talked way too fast and seemed in a rush for everything  which my dad and I didn't really like. My dad's not old but he couldn't comprehend what she was saying because she was in too much of a hurry for whatever reason. Even I took a few more seconds than necessary to fully understand what she was asking or offering. Besides the few annoying times she was around  it was a good time with my dad.I've been to BJ's a handful of times and none of those times are too memorable. A few times I just come with a few homegirls to share a pizookie because this is the only place I know that sells them.
Rachel B.,San Bruno  CA,86,86,2,7/13/2011,3.0,The food is ok but the wait times are too much. Evertime I visit I am asked to wait at least 30 minutes even when there are empty tables! If it's the middle or the week or a sarurday evening there is ALWAYS await  some days as long as 2 hours. Their giant stuffed potatoes are relly good and are the Pizookie but for the price and wait times I think I would prefer go to Chili's.
Blair Z.,Millbrae  CA,2,26,2,8/23/2013,1.0,LEMME TELL YOU ABOUT MY NIGHT. I'm sitting in the restaurant. Right now. And this service is BEYOND awful. Our waiter decided to go on break in the middle of serving us  so his 3 back up guys  who've I've seen maybe twice in the hour and a half of me being here  have taken over. I ordered a pasta dish that was supposed to be filled with spinach and artichokes in a cream sauce with grilled chicken. What do I get? Barely any pasta  maybe 3 spinach leaves and 2 big ass pieces of deep fried chicken  along with no cream sauce. Delish  right? Wrong. Absolutely disgusting. I could've made this meal at home instead of paying $15. I've been here multiple times before and my only complaint has been that their food is basic and kind of flavorless. Tonight ruined it for me. Never EVER coming back.
Tim R.,South San Francisco  CA,0,6,,5/28/2014,4.0,Took my my buddies here last weekend to watch the playoffs in the bar.The waitress was very quick to get to our table. The beers did take a long time to get out. The place is load but everyone is having a good time. The pizza was great.will be back
Leonardo C.,San Jose  CA,46,50,13,12/23/2014,5.0,it's open  it's completely wheelchair accessible  always games on  and a good crowd every time. 5 stars.
Jonathan B.,San Francisco  CA,49,33,475,12/11/2011,1.0,NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. The people are rude and unaccommodating. I wouldn't have given it a single star if I didn't have to.Tonight I came here with my family. We anticipated that it would be busy so we called ahead to leave our name on the wait list  specifically saying that we need space for a car seat  which at least over the phone  was ok with them. We get there  and they set us up in one of the elevated booths. We pointed out AGAIN that we had a car seat and they insisted that we could fit it in the booth. So we go to the booth  and sure enough  the car seat does not fit. We ask them if we could get another table so we could all sit  and the girl that sat us rudely said that we would wait again. I told her that we are not going to wait again  after waiting for an hour since the time we called for another table to open up. So reluctantly  they gave us another table  and things didnt get any better. The waitress we got was rude  and she didn't check on us.Before we left  we spoke with the manager on duty and told him that we are not coming back anymore because of the experience we had. At least he apologized  but it was too little too late.
Susie B.,Salinas  CA,0,1,,5/25/2015,1.0,BJ's service is known to be slow  so I won't complain about that. BUT inexcusable to get an iceberg wedge made with CABBAGE  and a wine glass delivered covered with lipstick. Completely unwashed. The bathroom was a mess also. And we were there early-it was not crazy busy.
Palomita a.,San Francisco  CA,1,8,,5/9/2011,1.0,In general  I love BJ's restaurants and have visited multiple locations throughout California. Good food  comfortable atmosphere and friendly/attentive service. This BJ's restaurant  however  has consistently been a disappointing experience for me. During my most recent visit we waited over an hour to be seated (not unexpected on a busy Sunday evening and for a larger party of 6)  but the service continued to disappoint from that point on. Our server was no where to be found  and only appeared after we called the attention to the manager (who seemed to be the only person available). The food served last night was average  no one followed up to check on us during our meal and the wait for the bill was also painfully slow.I would write off this poor experience to a particularly busy (maybe short staffed?) night  however the last time I visited with just my boyfriend the service was also very poor. We returned tonight to give this particular location a second chance  but the next time I will definitely endure the 15 minute drive to the BJ's restaurant in San Mateo.I will most likely return to BJ's restaurant - but definitely never again to this location.
Eleanor L.,Las Vegas  NV,478,104,42,8/6/2011,3.0,I'm not a huge fan of the food. It's decent and I like to go here to watch games. My favorite item is the patty melt. It's simple  plain and fills you up with warm goodness. Salads here are monstrous. At almost all restaurants  the largest margin of profit for an entree is a salad. Let me tell you  you get your money's worth here. They're so large I've stopped ordering them because you can't take home left over salads.
John S.,San Bruno  CA,0,4,,5/19/2014,1.0,Very bad service  server was definitley one of the worst ever...and it wasn't that busy we went for happy hour but i wasn't to happy at all...
Julie T.,South San Francisco  CA,189,93,66,6/27/2011,3.0,Drinks are pretty cheap. It's a decent place to chat and have a few drinks. I've never been a fan of their food  but LOVE pizookies of course. Anyway  the last time I came here with my cousin  there was a hair in our pizookie! EW EW EW EW! the server took it off our bill but we were turned off. We also ordered fries but they didn't seem like they were fresh? Id give any BJS 5 stars easily for their pizookies but minus 2 stars for the lame fries and pizookie mishap. I'm a little scared to order food again  but if I do get the courage to forgive  then I'll review again.
Gerline R.,Daly City  CA,16,61,19,9/9/2014,1.0,They never fail at giving horrible customer service! and as for the food.. that is all.
Jade D.,Daly City  CA,41,100,74,3/7/2012,3.0,"I hate Waiting to get seated  of all the places BJ\'s is the worst. It\'s effin ridiculous. I came here with my friend  and as we were waiting  somehow we were the last ones STILL waiting. Supposedly  they ""buzzed"" our beeper  but I swear  that didn\'t work. I doubt they did  but they claimed too. They apologized  and after almost an hour  we finally got seated. FINALLY.Ordered half/half of their great white pizza  which is really dee-lish! (and another half of their Sweet Pig. That was just alright to me.) I love their chicken wings  with ranch sauce  bruschetta  and their alcoholic beverages are pretty good too  but I haven\'t had a drink in forever. Oreo pizookie is a must  when dining out here  otherwise you\'re missing out! Our waiter was really nice  and did a great job serving us. Yay to that  Boo to getting seated! It\'s a good spot to come here with friends  or your kids since it\'s a loud environment. First date  don\'t think so. Look elsewhere."
Dominic T.,San Francisco  CA,495,344,373,1/24/2010,5.0,"I love this place for any dining occasion. Service and food are A-grade. The pizookie here is good enough for a trip here alone. Don\'t miss out on the root beer float either. I usually have to order it every time. Call me weird but I only order the grilled chicken pasta. The food tales a while to come out from the kitchen so if you\'re extremely hungry  order an appetizer. I recommend the brushetta. Sometimes the receipt will have an invitation to a satisfaction survey and in return you get some kind of a ""reward"" (i.e.  free mozzarella sticks).I didn\'t realize that my grilled chicken pasta only takes a few minutes to prepare. I was the last to order as I arrived late to dinner and I got my food before the three other people at my table. I guess it\'s to my advantage. The servers are friendly  for the most part. I always have the impression that those who work up at front desk have an odd attitude  but maybe that\'s just me. I come here about once per month and everything is the same. I hope there will be more new menu items offered soon. I want to pop the pasta bubble and try the many other offerings."
Jercams C.,Pacifica  CA,0,1,,5/7/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Long wait even on a weekday. Poor service. Food is not good at all. Never will I comeback to this place.
Brian A.,San Bruno  CA,137,221,,2/19/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"This place is growing on me. I really like the beer  especially the tatonka stout. In fact most of the beer here is good. My second favorite is the brown ale.This seems to be my go to for when I\'m in a ""I want to go out for a beer but don\'t want to drive too far"" mood. Also can\'t hate too much on a place with HH after 10 pm.Now the food is still of the hit or miss variety. Every now and then I\'ll get surprised by a dish or an appetizer  but more often then not the food is mediocre.... especially the pizza... the pizza is always mediocre.If I was just giving a review for the brews  I\'d give this place 4 stars. Unfortunately the food drags it down to either 2 or 3 star level."
Khalif P.,El Cerrito  CA,0,13,,8/16/2012,4.0,BJ's is that place you visit when you wanna watch the game and drink beer while eating overpriced  but pretty decent food. I usually enjoy myself when I visit this location (up until the bill arrives ) The customer service is always top notch which is a huge factor in me making the trip all the way out here on Bart.The pizza is pretty darn good and the Jeremiah Red Beer will absolutely have you feeling right after your meal. Shout out to Vladimir(i think that was his name  Jeremiah Red people!) for his great customer service!4 stars
Matthew D.,Tempe  AZ,892,644,394,4/19/2009,2.0,The food here is 4 stars. I've had great meals here. Why only two stars? I've got a two word response for you:THE SERVICE (or rather the lack thereof)We arrived fairly near closing time and the restaurant was not all that busy. The waitress  however  was really hard to find and not attentive to us at all. My wife had the BBQ ribs and really enjoyed them  but when she asked for a wet wipe for her hands (a standard thing to give to someone eating ribs)  the waitress said that they didn't have any. When my wife asked for a wet napkin  the waitress came back five minutes later with a cloth napkin with one corner wet with cold water. My wife's second margarita took 15 minutes to arrive  and where was the waitress through all this? At empty tables  checking the levels of the salt and pepper shakers and not really checking in with customers. Either that  or we couldn't find her at all. After looking for her for 10 more minutes to get the check  my wife expressed to her how disappointed we were with the service. The waitress responded with a story about how difficult her job is and about all of the things that she had to do. To me  this was the last straw. We won't be coming here for a while.BJ's BLOWS. Check other reviews below. I am not the only one to complain about BJ's service  and this does not appear to be isolated to the Tanforan location only. Something is definitely wrong here and I would suggest that people avoid this place until the management gets it act together.
Anu P.,Philadelphia  PA,479,345,182,6/15/2013,3.0,A very typical BJ's experience: poor service  yummy appetizers and drinks. Service: My friend and I got seated pretty quickly on a Friday evening around 5:45pm. However after being seated  our waitress didn't come for about 10 minutes. When she finally did  we ordered our drinks and appetizers all at once. After that  it took her another 10 minutes to bring us water! So much waiting just for water. Our drinks came out quickly after and so did our appetizers. Again  after we finished eating  our waitress basically disappeared because she didn't come to check in on us (I wanted red pepper flakes for my pizza) and she didn't come back until about 15 minutes after we finished eating. I kept seeing her serve the high stool tables  possibly because they were for bigger parties (thus bigger bills and tips  as suggested by other yelpers). She kept refilling drinks and coming back for things they needed  but it took me forever to flag her down to finally get our bill. This is not unusual though--BJ's typically has very poor service because there are always SO many people around and each server has to take care of one too many tables. However  since it was happy hour and Friday evening  I understand why the delays were a little longer. Drinks: The slow service didn't take away from the amazing drinks and food though! I ordered the Arnold Stronger  which as basically an arnold palmer with simple syrup and Kettle One Vodka. It came out stronger than I expected but after squeezing in some lemon juice  it tasted amazing. Refreshing  flavorful  and something new. My friend ordered the pear cider which he enjoyed as well. It was a half cider half beer type drink so it wasn't too sweet but still tasted much better than plain beer! Food: We ordered two appetizers: avocado egg rolls and goat cheese flatbread. The avocado egg rolls are a favorite of mine and never disappoint. They are rolls of thin bread fried with avocado  cream cheese  some sort of chipotle sauce  and tomatoes. They come with some sweet sauce  but you really don't need it. The avocado rolls hit the spot everytime and I couldn't resist from eating most of the plate while sipping on my drink. Perfection! The goat cheese flatbread was tasty as well. It was a thin bread with goat cheese  zucchinis  mushrooms  tomatoes  and light pesto. The slices were light and flavorful. Only thing i didn't enjoy was how much goat cheese was on some of the slices  but if you like goat cheese  you would love this flat bread! The pesto was also a good consistency because it wasn't runny and oily on the flatbread either. Verdict: Despite service issues  I always love coming to BJ's because their drinks and appetizers never disappoint me! I want to come back for the stuffed mushrooms...already dreaming of them!
Nicole P.,San Francisco  CA,3,47,143,2/25/2015,2.0,"I don\'t like writIng bad reviews and I\'m not a big complainer BUT! These guys suck ...the service is horrible it\'s worse then horrible! I haven\'t left a review cause I thought maybe it was a bad waitress  or a bad cook  or maybe someone was having an off day....however every time we come here our order is messed up. The most recent experience was we ordered our appetizer and my sons food so he can eat immediately. Girl seemed nice enough and took the order and brought his food ASAP. Along with appetizer. So we ordered our main meal and 20.....30....40..mins pass by and she doesn\'t even come around we cant get anybody attention. Finally she comes around and we ask her for our food and she looks confused.says she will be right back.....15 mins later a different waitress comes and says the original girl needed to go to break.....ummm ok where\'s our food?? So she asked us what we ordered so she can check on it.....comes back out immediately and says it will only be a another 10-20 mins until it\'s done(I\'m assuming just enough time to start cooking it) so we told her never mind just give us the bill for what we have on the table....the manager came out and apologized and comped the food....we told him we didn\'t even want it and he was pretty insistent that we take the meals comped.....we told him we will wait another 5 mins....and we would leave....been here over an hour and still haven\'t even gotten the soup?? Isn\'t that made already??? Whatever lesson learned if I want a pazookie (the dessert is the only reason I like to go and everytime we come I can\'t get pass the bad service to get to dessert)guess I will have to find another bj....also the original waitress who ""went on break"" was helping all the other tables around us....so mess up then hide...that\'s cool....the 2 stars r for the new waitress and manager who at least attempted to fix things."
Fannie S.,San Francisco  CA,26,1792,108,5/3/2009,2.0,I had the California Chicken Sandwich  which was very bland and boring. Their home fries or whatever it was were huge and over-seasoned (read: salty). It's just another chain with american diner food. Burgers  salads  pasta  sandwiches. Large portions  overly-salty. Apparently they have beers and deep-dish pizzas too. *shrugs* Service was not fast  and barely friendly (or caring). Our server forgot to refill the water glasses  brought us the bill without a jacket (everyone else got one!)  and knocked over one of our water glasses. Ambiance  very open  dim-lighting. Go here if the rest of the mall is NOT open. (I'd rather eat at TanForan's food court which has decent food  and no need to worry about service  as it is self serviced.) Although  my date and I were greatly entertained by our neighbors and enjoyed the seclusion of our booth. ;-) *snickers*
Lawrence G.,San Francisco  CA,1447,20,,2/23/2015,4.0,I had a memorable time here and I took a girl here for dinner & we both had a good time on our official date people yadig! - You know Thank Goodness I call in advance like 2-3 weeks ahead of time  so we only waited for about 15-20 minutes  since they we're super busy. I order ceazar salad for my side dish along and I also got me a Sirloin Steak medium rare cook  along with mash potatoes  corn  and garlic fries folks. It was really good I mean even my Date and the girl I was with ask ME to get a taste of my main meal course and we also order TWO Blue moons & TWO Coronas for our beers and We both got New York Cheesecake for our Dessert! So Overall I had good night and the Girl i had a Date with that night had great time and we both had fun eating dinner & enjoying each others company on our date w/ good food & cool drinks fellas - it was just an awesome & fantatic night y'all!!! LOL! Haha. Relaxing  Cool  & Nice Place to hangout for a meal & spend time with a special someone like your girlfriend  fiance tol  or your wife feel me... Really A Nice/Cool Restaurant 2Eat Great Food Fellas/Ladies! =)
Lily S.,San Francisco  CA,90,76,49,9/29/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,it has been a good while since we last visited BJ's but hey the BF and I thought we should give this place another chance. So we get there around 7pm and was told that there would be a 25 min wait  which was great since it wasn't an hour. So our buzzer finally rings and we get seated. Service was a little slow from the get go but it's okay since we weren't starving or anything. We start off with a pepsi and a jerryburst (1/2 jeremiah red and 1/2 berry burst cider which i had to explain to the server) then we order a calamari and a large pizza to share (half great white and half buffalo chicken. Asked the server to not put any mushrooms on the pizza and to add garlic. Got the calamari and it was cold and spongy not like it should be which is light and crispy ate it anyways. The Pizza finally arrives 40 mins later and guess what .. my side was covered in mushrooms. Flagged down the server and told her i asked for no mushrooms and she said yup i told them no mushrooms and i told her well why is it covered in mushrooms then.. she said she apologizes and that it was the kitchens fault and not hers so she takes the pizza back. She comes back with the same pizza and tells us that go ahead and keep this pizza and she asked the kitchen to make a personal pizza with no mushrooms of the great white. That's fine and all but as soon as the bf started to eat the pizza i noticed it was doughy so i asked him if it was cooked through  he told me to try it and i did and it wasn't cooked all the way. The pizza was hard to rip and the bottom was doughy and undercooked not crunchy at all  so we had to send it back. Management comes by and apologizes and tells us that he has a new one in the oven  i told him to cancel it and that i would just like the bill for the calamari and 2 drinks but management was nice and told us to not to worry about it and told us that when we were finished we could leave at anytime and to visit them again in the future. So 1 star for that! I don't know how soon we would return  but we probably will come again to see if they got better
Mariela D.,San Francisco  CA,1767,759,2657,1/26/2011,3.0,For a chain restaurant  BJ's is above average. I've been here several times and the food has been consistently good (some dishes are better than others)  although a bit heavy and greasy. Their desserts are too sweet for my taste  and I don't even want to know how many calories they have! Their most famous dessert is the Pazookie  which is a giant  fresh-based cookie topped with ice cream.You should definitely check out their house beers - they do brew their own  after all. They offer a range - from the pale ales to the dark Tatonka Stout that'll have your head spinning with its high alcohol content. If you're not into beer  they have a full bar and an extensive list of specialty cocktails. The bar area (if you're fortunate enough to grab a seat) has several large screens so you can watch multiple games at once.If you're still not sure  try them for happy hour:Happy hour is Monday - Friday 3-7pm: $5 mini pizzas  $2 off appetizers  $3 beers  and $1 off cocktailsAnd on Tuesdays  you can have a bottle of wine with your meal for half offThe wait can get long on weekends since this place is located in a mall  so be prepared.
Marycathry V.,Thousand Oaks  CA,128,83,25,10/7/2011,1.0,"The customer service here is terrible. I placed a large order for pick-up for myself and all my co-workers and had specifically told the girl over the phone that we only had a photocopy of our boss\'s credit card and if that would be okay. She put me on a brief hold  then said that it would be fine.I got there about 45 minutes later and waited in the line at the take-out counter. No one acknowleged me  and I even went to the host stand to ask if there was anyone who could help me with my order for pick-up. She just directed me right back to the line I was already in. So I waited another 5 or so minutes until finally someone came back and helped the frustrated customer in front of me.When it was finally my turn  all the bags were set and ready to go  so I handed the girl the photocopy of the credit card. All she says is  ""Ohhh...THAT\'S what she meant."" So I said  ""Is there a problem?"" And she says  ""Well  the way she explained it to me made it sound like you had a photocopy of his ID  not his credit card..let me go ask my manager."" Two minutes later  the manager comes up and says  ""Hi  unfortunately it\'s our policy that we have to have the credit card present because there\'s no way of us knowing that that person authorized you to use their card.""Naturally I began to say  ""Okay  well what if I call my boss to have him authorize the transaction..""But he didn\'t even let me finish my sentence and cut me off saying  ""Yeahhh...we can\'t do that either.""I explained to him that I had specifically asked the girl about this over the phone before even placing the order and all he could do was shake his head and mumble  ""Yeah..sorry.""I have worked in Customer Service for over 7 years and even though I understand their policy forbids them from typing in a credit card number without the physical card present  I know that he  as a manager  could have made a judgment call on that one. Especially since it was HIS employee\'s mistake.I will not be returning to this particular BJ\'s."
Tamara N.,Peoria  IL,115,125,11,5/1/2011,3.0,This place is solid  but averagely solid.It's always crowded  the service is really slow  and there's usually a long wait for a table just because the food options as far as real restaurants go is fairly limited here.I do like the food. The spinach and artichoke dip is sinfully creamy and delicious  it's my favorite. I usually go for a personal deep dish pizza or the open faced chili cheese burger with shoestring fries  yum.I love their pizzookies!!!! A freshly baked cookie still piping hot topped with ice cream. One time the server mentioned you can split the cookie if you want  which blew my mindddd. I will never have to debate over a chocolate chip one or an oatmeal one ever again.... I can get BOTH. You have made my inner fat kid so very happy.
Donna R.,San Francisco  CA,0,59,,3/20/2014,1.0,This is a bar  not really a restaurant. It's really hard to mess up a burger  but they managed. Overcooked  way too salty and not anything like what is described on the menu: no onions  no special bun  etc. etc. I couldn't even finish it. Way too noisy for conversation; the only reason to come here is for a DRINK.
Jean T.,San Francisco  CA,96,136,189,1/22/2012,4.0,I like this place. Its a great place when we want a casual lunch for my family and none of us can agree on where to go/want to eat. They have a great variety of foods. The quality is decent  lots of flavor.They are a kid friendly kind of restaurant but also a great spot to hang out with friends and watch the game on tv.Service is pretty good  even when they're are busy. But be careful  they dont take reservations so if the place is packed  be prepared to wait 1-2hrs on weekend.
Jerico P.,Oakland  CA,704,401,403,10/31/2011,3.0,you had me at Pizookie-in celebration of one of my student''s eight grade graduation (Kyrene) her wonderful mother (Tita Lulu) invited me to join them for dinner. BJ Restaurant @ Tanforan was where I fell in love with you......Pizookie...-just the thought of the brilliant creation is enough to keep me coming back. warm freshly baked cookie  soft and chewy with a crunch  melting heaps of cool ice cream on top...-a word to the wise. call ahead. the evenings get packed and more so on game days. although you can always get the buzzer when you check in and walk across the way to Barnes and Nobles to take a look and enjoy a book while you wait.until next timecheers
Linda G.,Belmont  CA,29,21,3,3/19/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I have had a issue with a lost charm But the Manager John took it upon himself to make a bad situation right! He has asked me to lunch and then walk over to the place where my charm was purchased to replace it.Grant it they need to have a better lost and found system But I love BJ'S food and have NEVER had a bad food experience.One of my favorites are the potato skins...best ever!!! Great happy hour as well!!!!!!GOOOd Beer!!!
Adlyn S.,South San Francisco  CA,176,113,35,1/19/2012,3.0,"BJ\'s is like that ex-fling that you just keep on going back to for convenience. It hits the spot when needed ;) lol And it\'s named BJ\'s?! There\'s way too many ""That\'s what she said"" jokes for me to handle right now lol. Ok now on to the real review.The servers here are great and my food always comes out in a timely manner. The avocado egg rolls  deep dish pizzas  and pizookies with a cold beer makes up a typical yet fulfilling BJ\'s meal. You really can\'t go wrong with that combo.I have to dock off a star from my recent front of desk experience. Usually when you walk up to the front desk with a hostess doing nothing  you\'d expect a ""Hello! How can I help you?"" instead of a *blank stare* followed with me (THE DAMN PATRON) saying  ""Hi  I have a table for 3"" Clueless hostess  ""There\'s a 45 minute wait. *blank stare*"" So to the 17 to 20 something blank-faced Asian hostess  please remember that you\'re the first face I see when I walk into your establishment and possibly the last so you better be thankful for my business! Btw  it is a mall so I might have been willing to walk around and wait the 45 minutes instead of going across the street to Jack\'s instead. I really hope I don\'t see her pulling the same schtick again."
Rich A.,Daly City  CA,0,3,,8/29/2013,5.0,Went to bjs and sat in the bar area and was helped by trish and mike and just want to say they both were very helpful and met my standards in terms of exceptional service. They always checked on me and always answered any question and need I requested. I will definitely be back when they are working. They are a shining light in a corporate business that strives on sales and not neccasarily service.
Kristine P.,San Francisco  CA,3,39,16,5/29/2012,3.0,GREAT FOOD BUT LONG WAITS! Make sure to call ahead and get your name on waiting list to avoid long waits (avg 30-45 min wait during dinner and any time during weekends).Their pastas and deep pizza dishes are NOM NOM!! I also love Chicken A La Fresca (healthy dish). And Pazoookie for dessert!
Michelle T.,South San Francisco  CA,837,312,3527,2/7/2011,1.0,Tried to give this restaurant so many chances.... The service is terrible. I had a group on 15 people and waited sooo long to place our order and for our food to arrive. In addition  everyone got there food except for one person. That person was waiting on a bowl of soup and a Caesar salad. We didn't want to start eating until everyone got their order. I do not plan on ever coming back to this location again. Nor would I recommend it. You can get better service in Foster City..
Gen M.,Concord  CA,44,117,6,1/15/2012,1.0,I didn't know this time would come [read on if you know what I'm talking about].Two days ago my boyfriend and I wanted to eat out  so we decided to eat here. We ordered the MAC AND CHEESE and deep Dish pizza. I tried it before  but not anymore. After an hour of eatting here  I got sick. Thats right  food poisoning. Nausea  vomiting  watery diarrhea  abdominal pain and cramps  and fever. I got food poisoning from the MAC AND CHEESE I believe. My boyfriend didn't get sick  but me. I had to stay up till 2am to see if it was out of my system. Luckly my boyfriend was so worried that he had to stay up and make sure I'm okay.I never had food poisoning before till now.I don't think I want to go to BJ's anymore. Sorry guys  but it was a bad experience. hope you understand. :(
Serena F.,Daly City  CA,130,480,89,11/21/2011,5.0,love love their tomato bisque! I love BJ's. Their service is fantastic here and their manager (former and new one) are awesome. I love that they have the call ahead service which makes everything so much easier. I would stay away from their pasta though except their Grilled Chicken one. All the rest are a bit dry and overcooked.
Dessert F.,San Jose  CA,2,14,,1/19/2014,1.0,Recently moved to the area and went to BJs a few times within the first month. Our dine in experiences were pretty good but takeout experiences have been terrible!! Food for two people took a full hour longer than quoted over the phone. Order was incomplete for 30 minutes while they waited for a side of steamed veggies. Staff were polite but were clearly overwhelmed because the 3 orders around me were also incorrect. It appears communication between the staff is lacking and all they offered me was a soda while I waited. And that came after I'd been standing there for a hour beyond the expected pickup time. We'll eat at any of the other local restaurants before returning. Oh and avoid the berry cobbler. It looks and tastes like it came from an easy bake oven. Yuck!!!
Karla C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,6,,4/17/2015,1.0,"I decided to give this place a try and was I disappointed. We waited  around (45minutes to an hour) just to be seated  after this we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks (coke  water  beer) and then 45 minutes for the food. If you have all this time to wait for a simple meal then this is the place for you. Food came and there was no silverware on the table waited another 10 minutes for someone to bring us that. The waiter was well mannered but after a while the "" I am sorry"" just gets old and seriously doesn\'t matter anymore. if this is how you treat your paying customer I can\'t imagine why your employees would even care to work there. Will not be coming back nor will I recommend your establishment to anyone for this reason."
Joe L.,Millbrae  CA,203,147,11,1/9/2012,1.0,Not a full house but somehow being seated right next to the bar it takes 15 minutes to get a pitcher. It took over 20 minutes for the appetizers to ariive  but there was neither a nofication or apology for the wait. It gets worse  ladies and gents.When it finally comes  the appetizers were lukewarm  obviously from just sitting there for some time. The hyped promotional and cold boneless chicken wings were the size of a fifty cent coin  I kid you not. What a waste of 9 bucks. By far the most worst promotional item I have ever seen and eaten at a chain restaurant. You know it's bad when you think the check would be the fastest thing to get back  but even that took another 10 minutes after I raised my hand like I was in school. It will be a long long time before I return. Geez what happened to this place. It used to be ok but now it's easily the worst BJ's in a 30 mile radius. I get it you're busy so the service can be forgiveable  but terrible food is a no no.
Stephy L.,Millbrae  CA,813,199,616,10/25/2009,4.0,Friday night  i came here with my boyfriend since we were already shopping at Tanforan  and we haven't had BJs for a while.We got smarter this time  and went in to put our names down  the waiter told us it'll be around an hour or so (this is Friday night)  so i guess it was expected. SO we went back to shopping.Once we came back  they handed us the buzzer  and in about 10 mins  we were seated. In the beginning we seemed to be INVISIBLE. No water  waiter. nothing. But after 10-15 mins or so  our waiter for the night had came to rescue us :)he was very nice  friendly  and efficient. We asked for his recommendations on which appetizers to get and he suggested calamari and oh gosh  it was the best. We also ordered a root beer float  regular root beer  and with entree Chardonnay shrimp pasta. We WERE SO FULL that we couldnt get desserts :(the bill was $31. Very good service. Great food. :)
Tim C.,San Bruno  CA,65,50,1,12/18/2013,3.0,This place is okay  its not really a brewhouse  i don't know how they get away with saying that. I tired buying kegs here before and the manager was pretty confused  i guess i was like the second person ever. Pizza is not bad for Chicago style. Although everything else i've tried here was pretty mediocre  not bad  just very average. Lots of Tv's service is a little weird here sometimes  usually have to wait  bar should be more separate in MHO  but I would be down to come here with a friend. Prices are a little tad higher then i would like.
Stephanie J.,Singapore  Singapore,136,280,11,6/28/2011,2.0,Disgusting. Never  ever order take out. No curbside though they advertise it. My wedge salad came looking half eatten while my fries were cold and soggy. If I'm going to eat fatty food at least let me enjoy it while it goes down.
Rossi C.,San Francisco  CA,82,67,,5/12/2013,1.0,Quoted us 20 minutes for table  sat us in 45  10 minutes at our table without even eye contact or a head nod so we left.......haven't written a yelp review for two years but BJ' s was beggin for it...
Laurie C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,1,,12/10/2015,1.0,"I\'ve been a regular at this BJ\'s for years  but I was severely disappointed tonight. I never do Yelp reviews  but this was enough to make me write one. At around 9:15pm  my boyfriend and I walked into BJ\'s  hoping to get a simple takeout of appetizers. I should\'ve spotted a red flag when the total for 3 appetizers came up to $40. We waited about 20 mins for our food  and as we check the food before we leave - we realize we got the Sriracha bacon mac n cheese  when we specifically told the guy we wanted the appetizer one. My boyfriend hates Sriracha (I know  right?). Guess the guy couldn\'t figure out where the option for mac n cheese was on the register  so he just took the closest one. They also never informed us that the appetizer gourmet mac n cheese was removed from the menu. We return the mac n cheese  only to see there was nothing on our sliders except the beef + the bun. No tomato. No onion. Nothing. All the while  employees are on their phones  gossiping. I\'ve worked in retail/customer service  and no supervisor of mine would tolerate having a phone out during shift or not keeping busy in some way. When the sliders came back  there was cheese  but nothing else on them - that alone took 15 minutes. The employee then told us  ""The chefs do what the chefs do."" After waiting for an hour and receiving no apology  we left very disappointed."
Aprams C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,15,,3/3/2015,1.0,"Worst service in the World  100% AMATEUR  BJ staff told us to be on time for 5:00 reservations and we didn\'t get seated until 5:45. I had to tell the mgr. ""how does it take to seat 9 people? we have been waiting since 4:55 pm."" Mgr was watching all the monitors. Half the staff was off and the new staff was coming on. Our first waiter handed us off to a new waiteress. No table ware  no plates. and one appetizer with 6 bread slices for a table of 9. No water. One waitress abandoned to take care of 9 and she was a NEWBIE. Quality Inn Receptionist had equally bad service for his father\'s birthday party. He couldn\'t run a tab because the San Bruno Bartender (NEWBIE) didn\'t know how!!! Dinner was late & atrocious."
Gill C.,San Francisco  CA,359,372,1481,12/15/2008,3.0,OK  I've been to BJ's many times (mainly on weekends)  and service hasn't been stellar. Yah  I know it's a chain restaurant  etc.  but I've enjoyed most of my dining experiences mainly because of the food (minestrone soup  caesar salad  sliders  spinach artichoke dip  and pizookie dessert). I was surprised to hear there was a 30-40 minute wait on a Monday eve. What the hell!?! We took a chance and found a table at the bar (woo woo!) There were seasonal beers  and stoked that they had a pumpkin ale. Yummy! The pumpkin flavor wasn't overpowering and just perfect. They had several new items on the menu  and was happy to see they have a tomato bisque soup (a fav of mine)  and of course  ordered the soup and salad combo. The soup was steamy hot and could see all the herby tomatoey goodness  and was not disappointed. 'Twas good to the last spoonful. Of course  you can't come to BJs and not order a pizookie!!! Ohhh  I love the warm choco chip cookie gooeyness and two heaping scoops of vanilla ice cream. So sinful  but who cares! Service was superb  and was pleasantly surprised. Our server cleared the table and gave us menus within minutes of sitting down. Food arrived after a short wait (and trust me  I've waited for over 20-30 minutes for food  which at times was the wrong order). When our server went on his break  he stopped by to announce it and introduce his replacement  who was equally attentive to us. However  my friend and I were there long enough for our original server to return back. I was happy to end my long day catching up with a dear ole' friend (my childhood BFF)  and enjoying a quite pleasant dinner at BJ's.
Bill L.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,2,251,,1/30/2015,3.0,afternoon snack. calamari: crispy outside (very good) - inside the squid was dry and toughbuffalo chicken pizza - good good goodbison burger - not bad
Nat W.,Ashburn  VA,6,77,21,11/4/2011,2.0,First of all  the food is ok  the portion is a small  perhaps it's the SF's way of telling the rest of Americans how fat we are..... whatever  I am here to eat and enjoy the food.Second  because my buddy ordered a cake and ice creme does not mean that we are going to share it. If we are going to share it  bring another plate  not two spoons! As I said  this place is really close to SF.Lastly  the service is slow.
Monica M.,San Diego  CA,66,56,37,1/26/2012,3.0,Not too sure how to describe BJ's even though I come here pretty often. It's a good place. It's not like a place where you go often because you can't live without it  it's just a good restaurant that's close by and has some good selections. My favorite food to get are their appetizers. I love their avocado egg rolls and potato skins! Pizookies are good too  but I don't get them too often :]. My favorite pizookie is probably the white chocolate macadamia nut or oreo. I just wish they had happy hour.Service can go both ways  but it's typically normal. The prices could be around $8-$12 for an entree.The wait could be long/short depending on the time of day you go. Nights are typically the busiest. But  they do allow you to put your name on waitlist  so that's good.
Dan B.,San Francisco  CA,4993,595,375,11/28/2008,3.0,"In my search to try things pumpkin flavored or inspired  I find myself here.Each month BJ\'s serves a specialty beer and this month it happens to be Pumpkin.What are the chances?It\'s a decent brew -- not too pumpkin-ie  good frothy head  and has a nice deep amber color.The thing is I just don\'t like the idea of combining the sweet comforts of pumpkin with the affects of alcohol -- flashback to the days of wine coolers. So I had my one glass and went back to drinking my standard Porter.I know BJ\'s is a chain place but it does have its good points.The one I appreciate most is the late night happy hours: half price on some decent appetizers and personal pizzas as well as a dollar off their tasty brew.Their biggest down point has to be the service. It is either super attentive or down right absent. I\'ve learned to pace the drinking of my brew since I never know when and if I\'ll be asked  "" do you want another?"""
Tom C.,Fairfax  CA,159,165,6,10/23/2011,3.0,After a half-dozen trips here with co-workers  for lunch and drinks after work  I gotta call this an average place.Food is decent  with big portions  but not exceptional. Prices are ok. Ambience is busy pub  generally noisy and crowded with a mixture of shoppers and folks who work in the area. Service is highly variable  sometimes good  sometimes awful  never great.The beer is very good  with some nice microbrews. And the drinks are ok. There's nothing specifically wrong with this place as a restaurant  but there is nothing really special or fun about it either. I will go there once in a while because it's convenient  but that's the only reason.
Surge C.,San Diego  CA,305,587,1301,1/4/2011,2.0,What do I love about BJ's? Happy hour.What do I love about THIS BJ's? *pondering*...*still pondering*....Oh yeah  that's right-NOTHING.The service is absolutely atrocious. Yep  I said that pompous line. No other way to describe the ridiculously slow  ignorant staff here. My friends and I have dealt with the same terrible 20-something waiter twice and both times he screwed up. Once on an order. The other time he forgot my friend's food. Now we only come here and sit at the bar because we have had more than 2 bad experiences at this location. It is unfortunate that this is the nearest BJ's.
Jessica K.,Augusta  GA,364,1195,1239,1/27/2009,1.0,"How do I rate thee? Let me count the ways...1. Came into the restaurant around 9:30 p.m. on a Saturday with no front desk staff to greet us. Rather there were two girls in black shirts talking and giggling and pretty much carrying on until one finally nudged the other and motioned for her to do her job.2. Sat down in the main dining room right next to a server station. No big problem there but you\'d think if you\'re right next to the computer terminals and condiment station  someone would notice you after 15 MINUTES???? I watched an entire 4th quarter without someone stopping by. We even put the menus to the side of the table. NOTHING.3. A female server comes by finally:""Are you guys ready to order?""""I\'ll have an iced tea.""""I\'ll also have an iced tea.""Tick tock tick tock...8 minutes go by.""Here\'s your water and here\'s your iced tea.""(I should have known where this meal was going by then.)Not only did this chick not get the drink order right but where\'s the damn sugar??We had a California Chicken sandwich and their Cajun Pasta. Now a few words about sandwiches: It should have lettuce on it. Some sort of vegetable-something with color  nutrients-SOMETHING! All I could see and taste on it was massive loads of butter  cheese  bread. That\'s it. Where\'s the lettuce  tomato  pickles-anything?? The only thing saving that sandwich was the fries which WERE hot.Cajun pasta had a horrible sauce that reminded me of Chef Boyardee. Now you all know Chef Boyardee from when you were a kid right? I\'m not paying $16 for something that\'s coming from a can. I send the pasta back and you know what? She didn\'t look surprised the food was coming back.What\'s worse? The manager walks by  points to our table  look at our server then nods and walks away. Wow...not even worth his time for a quick visit huh? I\'m not coming back ever then.The service was horrible  the food was disgusting and the way the management ran the place was awful."
Jannette A.,Hayward  CA,85,2,,8/9/2013,1.0,Came here with my bf to have a nice meal We've come here for a long time always ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and nothing ever went wrong .... we went today ordered the same thing and it was made from tomato sauce not BBQ sauce (tomato doesn't go we'll with my stomach) so I told our server i couldn't eat it because its tomato she took it back and came back with the pizza and says no it's BBQ and that she asked the chef and the cooks blah blah blah ..... i wouldn't have been mad at all I was gonna just take the pizza and take it home to my brothers but then she has the fucking nerves to come sit next to me and say that if I didn't believe it was BBQ she would try it for me and tell me it was BBQ .....because obviously i cant taste the difference seriously?? This is ridiculous I just left bad service and even worse server hope this doesn't happen to anyone else
Valerie N.,San Francisco  CA,8,37,4,1/13/2014,1.0,Do not want to get into the specifics but if you have a card and your friends are paying cash  check your account. Asides from that food was cold and service was not up to par.
Alie C.,Santa Clara  CA,561,683,14,9/8/2013,3.0,"Disappointed to say that I had a less than stellar experience here. We sat in the lounge area during football  which may have been our first mistake. The service wasn\'t good. We had one ""server"" but had to ask for help from several other people over the course of the night. Everything we asked for took forever. My margarita had something floating in the glass so they had to make me another one  which took another 10 minutes to arrive. They obviously didn\'t have enough staff working or the people they did have were not capable of handling a busy area. The silver lining of this place was the bartender. His bar was full and he was obviously busy  but he still managed to be charming and funny. I wish he had been our server."
Jun R.,Sacramento  CA,6,134,93,11/25/2013,2.0,Service painfully slow  server not engaged and not particularly friendly. Too bad. This place used to be a pretty reliable late night dive with good food and service.
Kayla S.,San Jose  CA,26,28,10,3/15/2012,5.0,Yummy Cheese burger pizza and pastas !!! also good desert is the PIZOOKIE :)I celebrated my daughter's birthday here a few years back they have great excellent customer service the coolest part about this place is inside the Tanforan Mall!!I get to eat good pizza with my family then we can do shopping after :)I love this place and I dont think twice on recommending to my friends and famiy.
Mac C.,San Bruno  CA,2,5,,3/14/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Great place for a sit-down dinner with friends and family or if you just want a quick pizookie. Our server Jessica was also very friendly and displayed exquisite expertise when it came to our questions about the menu. Fire
Krystal F.,South San Francisco  CA,49,47,2,7/13/2011,5.0,Love love love this place even tho it gets super crowded at times which is a drag but they go around giving out samples of food as you wait. For the most part I sit at the bar just to get a appetizers and drinks. the staff is always friendly and upbeat which makes your visit even better. I always order a Ritatini  which I highly recommend if you would like to get a great drink and a good buzz. Its not on the menu anymore but they the bartenders always make it! Service is always fast  never had to wait a long time for food or drinks. Appetizers are my favorite  especially the potato skins. ( I highly recommend them) Fun atmosphere  friendly staff  and yummy food!!
Emilia G.,San Francisco  CA,0,69,,2/7/2015,4.0,My third time here in the past 5 years. No complaints. The service has always been in the top 95%. Food quality - pretty good! Perhaps not like a San Francisco fine restaurant but for a chain  not bad at all and much better than others.
Marie T.,San Francisco  CA,26,82,58,11/1/2011,3.0,Ahhh....the ultimate hype of the ever famous BJ's. Do people come here for the food? Or is it the environment? Or could it be the service? Or maybe it's because of their cool bar area with all the TV screens? Whatever the reason may be...this restaurant is ALWAYS PACKED!They serve good food for a decent price. Because of the constant busy-ness  the service is not always the best  but they get their jobs done. The restaurant is in the Tanforan mall  so it's prime for bringing people in. The downside is that no matter what time or day of the week  there more than likely is a wait. Though it's been a while since I've actually dined in  I know there have been a few times where my quoted time was over 40 minutes.
Nina P.,San Francisco  CA,33,4,,2/5/2014,1.0,Me and my boyfriend came here last night to celebrate our anniversary. When we walked in we saw it was packed so we went to the hostess and asked if she had a table for two. She said she can sit us immediately so we got seated and waited for a waiter or waitress to address us. After 30 mins no one came to our table so we left and went to Red Robins instead. The most annoying part was the other tables around us got their food and the servers saw us but just kept on walking. Talk about crapoy customer service  im going to think twice before coming here ever again.
Maggie M.,San Francisco  CA,204,72,3,5/9/2013,2.0,I normally love BJ's. However  my experience tonight has changed my opinion in BJ's for a while. For the first time  I ordered BJ's favorite deep dish pizza. This was supposed to come with three meats  Italian sausage  meatballs and pepperoni along with some veggies. What came out was not what I ordered. For one  the crust was soggy. Two  pizza was cold. And lastly  THERE WAS NO MEAT ON MY PIZZA. I was too engrossed with conversation with my friends to realize this so I had about 3/4 of it before I realized it had no meat. I told the server about this and he said ge probably mixed up the pizza and offered to bring me another one but since I had already eaten most of it  I felt that there was no point in getting a second one. I was already completely full. Now  I'm really not one to complain about a whole lot  but I felt that there could have been something else done to fix the situation. My friends kept telling me to ask him to comp the meal but I felt that would have been kind of shady. Oh well.
Siai M.,San Francisco  CA,12,91,67,12/13/2011,4.0,Convinient since it's located in the mall. However it is usually packed and most times there is a wait. The food is good but the service is kinda slow. Great place to eat if you have the time. Enjoy!
Fatima Rose I.,South San Francisco  CA,8,3,19,1/5/2015,1.0,we used to eat here soo many times and never had a problem and yet this place doesn't even deserve 1 STAR. we reserved for 9 people at 8 pm. the lady said yes. we arrived at 7:55 pm said we had to wait another 20-30 mins. came back at 8:30-ish and our seats STILL WEREN'T READY. and now it's almost 9 pm and we still aren't seated. BULLSHXT.
Irma R.,San Francisco  CA,40,407,9,8/4/2009,4.0,Great deep dish pizzas  good pastas  apps are good  the avocado rolls  spinach dip  mozzarella sticks. The portions are huge! But it works out cause then you have left overs. For desert the pazzokie is deeeeeeeelish! that's a must when coming here. The place gets super packed  no matter what day it is. They let you call ahead for a table  so that's nice.
Mikaela S.,Pomona  CA,87,19,39,10/23/2011,2.0,"The stars are for the only 3 things I like: 1) the Parmesan crusted chicken  the chilli bread bowl  and their drinks. yeah that\'s 3 things but they really only deserve 2 stars.Other than that  this place has the WORST SERVICE EVER. Every time I go there something goes wrong  IE: my fries are burnt  they never bring me water  they bring the wrong dish (happened twice)  they FORGET to order my drink... You would think by now I\'d learn never to visit again  but maybe it\'s something in the food that keeps me coming back for more disappointment. It\'s pathetic how I still go there. It\'s a bad relationship that I just can\'t get out of. But the ""what-a-peach"" is my favorite drink. Tastes just like a peachie-o."
Mel T.,San Francisco  CA,181,310,818,4/7/2011,2.0,I don't drink  so I suppose if I were coming here solely for a pizookie  BJ's could potentially be a four star establishment. Service is alright  and I like being able to watch sports from all the TVs displayed throughout the entire restaurant  but what brings this place down is its regular food. Meh.We ordered:- fried calamari. I expect this to be a given at restaurants. Here  the batter and actual calamari texture were off.- fried artichoke. The one thing  other than the pizookie  we ordered that I liked. - beef sliders. Soggy bun. Yuck.- full rack of ribs. Dry. Super dry.- bowl of clam chowder. Okkkk  but too salty.- chicken marsala/chicken alfredo pastas. Not enough sauce  dry chicken  pasta not thoroughly cooked.- cookies and cream pizookie. Warm cookie with ice cream - you can't go wrong.Obviously I was expecting too much from BJ's. This wasn't my first time here  but it's been a long while since my last visit. Next time I'm eating beforehand and just coming in for dessert.
Lillian O.,Costa Mesa  CA,459,51,39,9/29/2013,4.0,Hadn't been to Tanforan for years. Met for a meeting and explored a new drink  at yet another BJ's location! Got to try the Watermelon Mojitos  tossed with mint  and fresh watermelon. Yummy! So good! Great waiters as well.
Steven B.,San Francisco  CA,111,516,79,10/9/2011,3.0,There's nothing amazing about the food  but it's alright place to have a big group party. They have quite a big selection micro brewed beer from different micro brewery ranging from local to far. There's a full bar inside of this place also so alcoholic drinks are possible.The pizza here is pretty good. It's a personal size pizza that's a deep dish pie. It's really oily  but it tastes alright.
Dee V.,Palo Alto  CA,780,430,1258,7/18/2011,4.0,Was there on a Friday evening. Had dinner here at BJs on the way to drop family at the airport. We ordered the chicken wings for the appetizers. Shared a jambalaya between the three of us. The portion sizes are huge and as we were not very hungry  one dish was good enough. We also had the chocolate chip pazookie. Everything was good  though very oily and rich.
Susan Y.,Daan District  Taiwan,241,356,529,7/16/2011,3.0,I've come here multiple times but I haven't gotten around to reviewing until now.The first few times  service was great. Didn't need to wait too long for a table and the servers were very friendly and accommodating. When I came here a few days ago... Not only was it unsatisfactory for me  but my friend was also irritated at how badly we were treated.The hostess said we'd wait around 25-30 minutes for a table. Okay  that was fine since it was around the dinner rush. We were given a pager and walked around in the mall for twenty minutes.We come back. Ask the hostess to see if they've called us  just to be sure. They haven't yet. We sit down on the booths provided for us  to wait. 45 minutes pass. Nothing. An hour pass. Something's wrong. Both me and my friend approach the hostess. APPARENTLY  they HAD called us. Uhm  no. The pager didn't vibrate or light up. She asks to check it and what do you know.. THE PAGER WORKS. Alright  strike one. You lied. We were seated quickly. Good.I ordered the creole tilapia with an iced tea and my friend got the flatbread pesto pizza with strawberry lemonade. It took the server about 10 minutes to come and take our order. And we got our food within the next twenty minutes. The food tasted amazing  which is why I'm not gonna give this place less than 3 stars. It's everything else that prevents me from giving a better star rating. It almost 9p by the time we got our food so we pretty much ate everything within 10 minutes. Not once did the server ask us if our food was okay or if we wanted refills. I know we ate quickly  but seriously? Ridiculous.
Max-Adam A.,San Leandro  CA,576,196,47,1/6/2011,5.0,"Pretty chill here on a weekday  i dont remember if i ate here or not. Took a friend here because we couldn\'t decide on what to have for dinner that night. When we arrived  we were informed that the wait was 45 minutes. I put my name down and we walked around the bar area to see if any tables were open and to see if customers were on the verge of being done with their dinner..We only saw one couple ready to leave as they were finishing up their pizookie  so we stood close by and patiently waited. While we did  I got us some beers (I ordered the Hefe and she had a Raspberry Belgium beer) and she found a high top table in the bar. After looking over the appetizer menu  we were contemplating on getting the wings which i always get yet she never had OR to go with something lighter and that neither of us had. We agreed on the NEW Ahi Poke which was new to the both of us. Seemed kinda weird for me to order that at an American chain restaurant...just saying. For Dinner  she ordered the Sliders with the wedge cut fries and i settled for a small Cheeseburger pizza.Ahi Poke: WOW! What a suprise  this was definetely on point! I can compare this Ahi Poke with a lot of asian restaurants and this can run with a lot of them. You get that nice chunk diced cut of fresh tuna  the saltiness from the soy sauce and that refreshing taste from the sesame oil. The ""lettuce"" slaw was a nice addition to it and had a nice little peppery taste to it. The fried won-tons complimented the Ahi Poke extremely well. Kinda felt like I was eating Ahi Poke Nachos (minus the cheese)...hmmmmSliders: This is what she ordered. She only ate one of the four sliders that were on her plate as she quickly became full. Maybe the dranks killed her appetite? LOL I picked off her plate and took a small wedge fry. It was nice  crisy outside and tender on the inside  seasoned very well. Cheeseburger pizza: Never a disappointment! She seemed to be amazed by it as well as she was eating a slice of pizza that I put on her plate. Kindly took the diced pickles off her slice as she\'s not a fan of them. mmmm thank God I ordered a small  HI-5 for leftover pizza! Service: 5 stars. Our server Mike was very kind and attentive to us. Was on point with his waiter attributes and always asked if everything looked and tasted good. This had to be the first time a waiter/watiress asked if the food LOOKED good. Interesting saying...Definetely will come back here  regardless of the 25 minute drive..food & drinks are superb  service is excellent!"
Tanya S.,San Francisco  CA,162,31,1,10/3/2011,3.0,This place is ok. They have a lot of food options and some great drinks  but the food never tastes that great. Except the avacado fried roll things....those are amazing!It's good for watching sports and man dates and the only decent place to eat in Tanforan mall.
Daniel B.,Lewisville  TX,0,5,,2/25/2014,5.0,This place has one of the best selections of drinks and food around. It can be pretty busy around 7 pm but it's worth it. Great atmosphere  and the staff is always friendly and helpful. My favorite place to hang out on the weekend.
Olivia V.,San Francisco  CA,288,116,782,7/5/2009,4.0,"I love BJ\'s...it beats the Elephant Bar at Serramonte hands down. But it\'s a bit of a drive from the city so I don\'t always find myself here. Boo. Yeah  it does get crowded and you are likely to have to wait for a table  but if you come around 5ish and avoid the dinner rush  the wait is nonexistent. They do handle large groups well though  and it\'s a nice place to have a party of 10+ people. They\'ll accommodate. I like their sliders  and they\'ll cook it to your specifications topped off with a side of yummy wedge-cut fries! They\'re fried to a crispy golden brown  yay.You wouldn\'t think that a place like BJ\'s makes hella good pizza  but they do. My ex boyfriend is a huge fan of the cheeseburger pizza  and it tasted like a cheeseburger...in pizza form. Um  what else? Awesome bartenders. They never get my ""Shirley Temple with a splash of pineapple juice"" wrong  and it\'s always consistent. The food is typical for this type of restaurant: pasta dishes  burgers  sandwiches  salads/soups  pizza. But the servers are always efficient and on top of things by asking if you want refills and if everything is going well. There are flat screens all around the restaurant and huge ones above the bar  making it an ideal place to watch the NBA finals! There\'s an outside patio that I\'ve been wanting to sit at for a while now...I\'ll just wait for the perfect summer evening.Ohhh  and the infamous Pizookie  \'nuff said. :)"
Marie G.,San Jose  CA,152,130,151,7/24/2009,3.0,My friend and I came here (my first time) and he told me about the chicago style pizzas. We came here for lunch and pizza and beer which sounded pretty good to my stomach. It was around 2pm we came here and it was low key and not so busy seeing that it was a brewery and kinda like a pub. We sat at the bar in front of the 4 screens of soccer  ESPN  more soccer  and skateboarding. We ordered the Southwestern which was a new item on the pizza menu and beer. The bartender had to talk to his manager because my ID was outta state (OR). It was inconvenient but it's protocol for them. Whatever. The pizza was alright.. i think that's cuz i forgot to ask for tobasco sauce. haha whoops. But it was tasty and satisfied my palate. I was a little disappointed with the taste since my friend told me it was the best  minus a star. The amber helped me fill my tummy and get a little rosy in the face. I do like the fact that you can walk around in the mall after filling up the stomach. :D Minus a star since I don't come here enough so I gave it an Okay rating.
Carrie G.,San Gabriel  CA,46,169,3,5/19/2011,3.0,Had dinner here last night. I am used to the whiteness of Marin  and I always forget the abundance of Filipinos everywhere. So this was a welcome surprise. We got in around 745 an the wait for a table was about 40 minutes. I was about to get a beer at the bar and lo and behold 2 guys leaving as I am approaching the barkeep. It was great timing. So he cleaned the area  but it smelled like gross bar towels  so I had to fare with that all dinner. Love that they have multiple games on the telly  except with my easily distracted brain  I had trouble focusing. The people watching here was good  the guys next to me I think was on a date and the girl did not wanna watch a movie with him  poor thing. I digress. Our food came out almost instantly  which is expected in a chain where they just nuke the food  but it was still pretty good. The service was alright  if only the hot bartender paid us more attention Might have given this place an extra star. Alas our pizookie arrived and all the shortcomings left my mind. I would return again  if only to watch eye candy and eat a pizookie.
Sunie K.,Oakland  CA,51,45,1,12/28/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Ok  I know I reviewed this before and it was a one star  but I have to update this because it seems to be going down hill.First  we sat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Several minutes pass  and the bartender didn\'t even say hi once. And no  he was not busy. In fact he was so not busy that he managed to make the people\'s next to us drinks and chat with his coworker (probably comparing goatees). So  we moved to the dining area. Big mistake  we should have just left. NO ONE greeted us for 10 minutes  Not even a ""hi."" Luckily  Carlos  someone that we\'ve met before was working and took our order even though he was supposed to be off. If it were not Carlos  we probably would have just walked out. I ordered fish and chips and my boyfriend ordered pork chops with extra mashed potatoes and clam chowder. We also had cheese sticks to start off.The clam chowder came out barely warm. Whatever  mood is sour  but I\'m ok. Entrees came out and his mashed potatoes were COLD. Like just came out of the fridge cold. I\'ve had enough after that. I told a manager and he was nice and comped our entrees. I NEVER complain about anything when eating out. This place is just awful.I don\'t care about the comp food I\'ll probably give it to someone homeless or maybe a dog since they have low standards for food. I would rather pay money for good service and even better food."
Jerry P.,Daly City  CA,4,15,2,2/18/2014,5.0,Since I fairly watch my diet  everytime I step into a restaurant the first thing I check is their salad then appetizers. I just love their seared ahi tuna salad  soup and strawberry lemonade. Plus  my 20-month-old daughter is always in a good mood throughout our meal. We feed her with the kiddie meal while she enjoys her coloring book. Will definitely come back.....
Jay Y.,San Francisco  CA,38,15,2,1/15/2014,2.0,They get 2 stars only because the manager or supervisor did accommodate us when we complained the poor service. I come here a lot  often with friends to watch sports. That's when Buffalo Wild Wings is jammed pack. But Bj's service is horrible. I remember calling in just to reduce my wait time upon arrival and the rep stated that it would only be a 20 minute wait. I ended up waiting an hour and 10 minutes. Not only that  I asked the rep why I was told to wait only 20 minutes and she couldn't even explain. All I wanted was a simple explanation and I was going to move on since my table was ready. But then another girl  the so-called coordinator  butts in  gives me a bad attitude while explaining to me why the wait. She had no idea I had called in ahead of time. And to make matters worse  I was not even being rude or unreasonable to the rep. How disappointing.
Razel M.,Seattle  WA,149,256,44,2/19/2011,3.0,I have been at this particular BJ's numerous times for various reasons. One consistent thing: service sucks here. I mean  really sucks. They either need to hire more staff  or they need to hire better staff. I have ended up sitting at the bar area more often than not  and still get pretty slow service.Why am I still giving three stars? Well  it is open late  in an area where a lot of spots close early. Particularly good that it is open late on Sundays -- yes  world  there are people who need food and a shot even on Sunday nights. Particularly so close to the airport  where Sunday is usually one of the busiest  most stressful days.Second reason is  the food is still pretty good  and they have such a large variety that you will definitely find something whatever you're in the mood for. And of course there are pizookies to enjoy  if everything else fails.
Sidz S.,San Francisco  CA,3,7,,10/27/2013,5.0,I've been going here over the years and I can say I have taken a liking to the place. I love that the menu has so many options compared to other places I've been to  I can always find something I can eat (veggie/pescatarian food). The very first time I went here I had fish tacos and a very very nice server! Too bad haven't seen her since. I usually get the fettuchini Alfredo and its always consistent. I like it here better than other places. And the strawberry daiquiri is bomb too. My usual order consists of those two plus a side of thick wedge cut fries! Yum! And they have lunch specials. Now I'm really craving some! There are also many TVs so when it's baseball season you know I'm there!
Amelia M.,San Francisco  CA,50,348,34,11/15/2010,2.0,"Service? Doesn\'t really exist here. It has consistently bad service. I don\'t know if they hire a bunch of pot smokers or what  but I swear we always get the most ""duh!"" type servers. The food is ok.... it is really nothing out of the ordinary. Your standard chain grub. Can\'t expect much  so I suppose it is safe to say that you shouldn\'t expect stellar service  perhaps they are short staffed  who knows. You can always go to another chain down the road (Chilli\'s) that will most likely be faster to get seated at."
Anio D.,San Francisco  CA,74,69,2,1/15/2012,3.0,I don't frequent these kind of places much  but I agreed to go last time to see a friend I haven't seen in a while. It was a Friday night  of course the place was full. I was given a pager for an hour's wait-- love that it's right across from Barnes & Noble so I had a place to kill some time. Anyway. When my party of 3 was complete upon arrival  we walked around to see if there were bar seats. For a while  we waited and waited. Finally 3 stools opened up  so we cancelled our pager and just ate there. Food was good  and very filling..although I wasn't that hungry. I still ate 3 slices of the deep pan pizza.Service was okay  actually  pretty good for a place that busy. It was a good experience  but personally  I hate crowded places just so I can eat. It's ideal  though  having 2 loud kids and not having to bother louder adults. But that still doesn't convince me to come in regularly.
Hannah C.,Castro Valley  CA,170,216,3,9/1/2011,3.0,Unlimited soup and salad is a great deal for $6.95 for weekday lunch  but the food quality was meh.You get a choice of house or caesar salad and any of their soups (clam chowder  broccoli cheese  minestrone  chili).I went with their chili and a house salad with balsamic vinaigrette.All their soups are SO SALTY! A little less salty  and I would be down to go back here and there for this lunch special  but the excessive sodium intake was too much. The minestrone I got afterward was less salty  but still too salty for me to enjoy the broth. I just fished out the veggies.I might be back sometime to try another of their lunch specials  but BJ's soups are definitely not for me.
Paul G.,Daly City  CA,117,100,50,8/28/2013,1.0,Drinks were? Till they mess the drinks up! We ordered a meat pizza that didn't have any meat.... Complain right away... don't let it lapse... the managers are lazy! We were never compensated... sad because I had high hope for this place...
Chintan P.,San Francisco  CA,28,15,,11/10/2013,5.0,Best deep dish pizzas + awesome pizookies
Hema K.,Aliso Viejo  CA,346,915,270,4/20/2011,2.0,Not the place for brunch for sure. Preferably should stick with happy hour or weekday lunch specials. Saturday brunch at BJ's while waiting for my car to be serviced at the nearby dealer. Food and service sucks. Ordered the classic sandwich. Potatoes were not fresh and looked more like re-heated rather than prepared on the same day.
Steve T.,San Francisco  CA,123,79,7,10/10/2011,4.0,Great Atmosphere.Good Food.Staff is adequate and attentive AT TIMES.TV's everywhere  great place to catch a sports game and have some beer.I come here all the time  mainly because my gf loves this place.
Ladi Da A.,San Francisco  CA,651,485,194,9/2/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,F*ck! STOP! DON'T EAT HERE!!!I hadn't been here in a while due to terrible service and ridiculously long wait times. It's been over a year. So  maybe things have changed? I decided to try the online pickup order. Pickup time...11:30am. Okay  so I call in at 11:00am to confirm my order's pickup time. Confirmed. Head over there. Arrive for pickup at around 11:35am. At 11:45am the guy working the pickup line is still on the first two customers he was helping when I walked through the door. The guy is obviously super flustered and cannot handle more than one thing at a time. I was there for 20 minutes  without ever being acknowledged! By 11:55am  I have sought out help from three other employees (host  waitstaff  etc.)  because if my food is ready...then it's getting f*ckin' cold!Finally  at around noon  they gather my three item order. Yes  a mere three simple meals. Yet  they completely forget the soup on one order. I didn't even bother to call after I noticed it missing  because I could not deal with any more frustration for the day. One of three items was a pizza  which was super wet and soggy at the bottom! Totally gross! What'd they do? Mop the floor with it?I spent over 30-minutes waiting for an 11:30am pickup order. If I had this much time to kill  I would have eaten at the restaurant!!! I nearly missed a meeting  waiting on this stupid order!I love BJ's  but I totally hate this location. The management and staff are completely unorganized and the staff do not know how to work under pressure. Yes  the kid working the pickup/express line was totally green  but if he sucked  it was obvious that he had no training and they do not have a system in place to organize their food orders. The kid working the express line needs training. He also needs backup! There were three hosts just standing around doing nothing  while this kid was freaking out running back and forth from the front to the back  and frazzled trying to take phone orders (difficulty multi-tasking). The hosts were just standing around with their thumbs in their ass. Two hosts are more than enough--there were 3 or 4!!! Put someone else at the busy pickup/express station! The cooks/chefs aren't getting orders out on time! Who the hell is making sure that food is being expedited out of the kitchen? The manager(s) were probably shopping at the mall  because no ONE was managing SH*T! People need training and the higher up(s) should get fired or go back to waiting tables  because things here are run chaotically and unprofessionally!!!If you like BJ's it's worth the trip down to their San Mateo location. The location in San Bruno at Tanforan completely sucks @ss.
Kellie A.,Las Vegas  NV,196,262,108,7/15/2011,4.0,visit: 7/7/11 9pmI'm already a fan of Bj's in Vegas  this one is no surprise still awesome.Had the tasters of 8 beers -berry burst  its already my fav.Got fish and chips which was delicious and hubby got fish tacos  which I tried  also delicious.He got the seasonal beer nitwit  which was ordinary we both agreed. The hefewiezen was similar  but tastier.On a thursday night at about 9 this place was really busy.Too full for desert...from beer...only ate half my food!
Billy C.,San Francisco  CA,172,81,37,10/14/2013,3.0,The wait time is painful. Their brew selection has improved from their own home brews to outside selections. Food is good and such large portions...pace yourselves.
Una H.,San Bruno  CA,0,37,11,12/29/2013,1.0,"Been here several time with ok service. But this time (dinner Dec. 29) bad experience. Our server was Miguel.1.) Were told the wait is 20 minutes. We got seated 50 minutes later. 2.) We asked for water  no ice. Got water with ice. 3.) We already got our appetizers and salads  but no utensils and napkins. Took long time to get those. What? You want us to eat like we\'re in the Stone Age? With our hands?4.) Ordered Spaghetti with meatballs. No meatballs. When brought to server\'s attention  was told they don\'t really have meatballs but only meat is in the sauce. But told him it says in the menu:      ""Spaghetti with meat sauce......$11.00          with meatballs....................13.00""Got the meatballs  ga-zillion minutes later. Cmon server  we\'re not stupid. You are stupid for trying to wiggle your way out of this one with the stupid  lame excuse for getting the order wrong. Next time  just own up to it and fix it right away.5.) Dirty glass used for soda. At first it was not noticeable because glass was full. But as I drink I noticed spots and solid  dried up stuff on the glass. An unwashed  dirty glass. These are not just honest mistakes. These were due to laziness  inattentiveness  irresponsibleness. Clearly reflects on the character of this server. And Miguel  you\'re lucky to get $3.00 for a tip. Suppose to be none because of the bad service you provided. Wanna have bigger tips? Improve your service. And this is not an isolated incident with regard to bad service/experience. Check other reviews."
Rylan C.,San Francisco  CA,628,537,25,6/1/2011,3.0,This place is ok. The pizookie is good and the refillable cream sodas are great but the rest of the food is just like all the other big-box chain restaurants.....unimaginative and mass-produced.However  I will point out that the service was great and my colleagues and I were pleasantly surprised with the dining experience. The food was ok and the service was good.I'll probably come here again just because the food is consistent. However  probably only for lunch. I'd prefer to go somewhere less crowded for dinner.
Christopher J.,Glendale  CA,203,252,294,4/11/2011,3.0,Well  I have to say that they make some pretty good Beer here. Good drinks  good friends  a great place to sit and relax and enjoy the night. The food is actually pretty good  depending on what you order. Not everything is good on the menu. But normally when I come in here  I order something to munch on  but mostly I'm drinking their beers with my friends and having a good time  I forget what I'm eating.. lolIt's going to be loud in this place  so be prepared. It's vary spacious  lots of room to walk around and stuff. The service is pretty solid. The parking is at Tanforan Shopping Center so there is no issues with that. This place goes well in this mall since the mall looks outstanding now. I remember back in the days when it was all run down and nobody would shop here. Now it's so lively and crowded :) PROS::1] GOOD beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer2] Prices are average3] Very spacious and you can be rowdy with your friends  its ok!4] Tons of parking at TanforanCONS::1] Not everything is good on the menu  what do you expect for American type food2] Sometimes service is a bit slow  but depending on the night
Emily V.,South San Francisco  CA,138,25,18,9/18/2010,1.0,This review is specifically for the server named Billy.I hope you enjoyed Table 601's note  and we hope you get fired.
Monlia W.,San Francisco  CA,273,40,10,1/24/2011,1.0,Now I have definitely had my fair share of BJ's visits across Northern California  but this one by far is the WORST BJ's that I have ever been to!! The atmosphere is no different from any other BJ's but the customer service is crappy to say the least. While we were questioning our not-so-fresh ahi poke appetizer  the waitress came over and asked for our assistance. She came and asked our table if we could help translate for some other patrons and assist in their order. My table chose me to assist and I did. I translated the WHOLE menu to them  both regular and the kiddie menu and they ordered a good amount of food. (Dessert too!)Not that I expected any sort of complimentary food or discount for my assistance  but the fact that they didnt even offer was sort of reflective of how lacking they were in customer service. C'mon now  its just business ettiquette if someone goes out of their way for ya! Getting back to my friends  they had messed up our orders (which is something I have almost no patience for). We had ordered a Cajun pasta with angel hair (that we specifically requested)  but they brought us fettucini instead. My order was the Thai Salmon dish  but there was nothing Thai about it...and the Salmon  like the Ahi  was questionable. The dish was served on a bed of white rice  which was undercooked; I would know  I'm chinese! My friend's country fried steak had a consistency of eraser shavings  wrapped in soggy breadding. It almost reminded me of a wet enchilada. No bueno.Overall  I would say that by this visit alone  I would never go back to a BJ's if it werent for their pazookies.
Kristine V.,San Francisco  CA,0,8,5,11/22/2013,5.0,5 star for great customer service and great food.waiters was nice.Came here for the first time to eat for my cousins 21st birthday.we had a group of 20 or more people and the manager gave all a bunch of giftcards after our meals.used that giftcard on another day.Free meal yay!!
Raymond L.,Daly City  CA,0,10,1,11/19/2013,3.0,3 stars solely based on the fact that I love the best beginnings and always get it for happy hour. The avocado rolls are the highlight of the menu. Great white pizza is undoubtedly spectacular as well! Minus 2 stars because the service is whack. Service is slow and we don't usually get checked on when we need something and food comes out when we're sick of waiting and ready to leave. However  food is great. Need some work on the service.
Lisa K.,San Mateo  CA,11,66,,5/29/2014,1.0,Horrible front desk service! I was told 20 minute wait; after 30 mins I check with the front desk (she was very snotty today) she informed me that I was only waiting 26 mins not 30 and the tables were not ready. It would be another 10 minutes. After waiting an additional 15 minutes; we asked how much longer and were informed an additional 20-25 minutes. It's not their fault the timing was off. Yet the people that came in after us that were groups of 4 were seated. You really need to remove whoever the short hostess working at btw 6:25 -7:25. She was not someone you want representing BJ's .
Caryn B.,Campbell  CA,23,153,6,5/20/2013,2.0,Bland white people food. Overpriced entrees. Stupidly large menu. Need I say more?
Ivan F.,San Francisco  CA,38,98,6,3/25/2011,3.0,Aaaaahhhhhh B.J.'s. The spot to go for San Bruno's suburbanites. They're version of a Cheers on steroids  but not. As soon you walk in  you notice that the majority of the folks in here were either at the mall  attend SF State  or live out in glorious San Bruno. Huge dining area and a long bar on the right as you enter. This place is aite. Your typical fare on a huge menu of various selections ranging from pizza and/or pasta to fish and chips and all that jazz. They've got a really good beer-on-tap selection (which is what they're known for...I assume) and  wait for it  PAZOOOKIES!!! What's a pazoookie you ask? Wow! You must not be living your life because pazookies are...bigass cookie pizzas. Um  ya. Stoners heaven.Decent place to go as a default joint. Especially if you got relatives from the Philippines and you want to impress them with what America is all about...excess. This is the place to go! Unless of course Cheesecake Factory is closer.
Kaylee D.,Daly City  CA,0,12,2,11/11/2013,2.0,The food was good so no complaints there  but the service on the other hand needs improvement. We were lead to our seats by a rather unfriendly hostess who handed us our menus and left. We ordered two dishes and an appetizer from our server who seemed nice enough  but as we discovered later  had a habit of disappearing. Our food came quickly  but our order was messed up- when the right dish came it was only slightly warm. We spent half of our meal without drinks and when we asked our waiter for an extra ranch it never arrived. If we do go back  we will be sure to get a better and more attentive server.
Girly Foodie F.,San Francisco  CA,0,116,,12/10/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,My hubby and I come to BJ's for the baby back ribs  baked potato and wedge salad and the most delicious BJ Porter beer! Large portions for the price and the ribs are usually very tasty and succulent. The shoestring fries are also great. Don't care much for their desserts (they need to expand the choices....Pazookies are just okay.)We have been happy 99% of the time. It's delicious  reasonably priced and the restaurant is pleasant and nicely decorated. We've always had friendly and prompt service  so don't quite get what the complaints are all about. There is often a wait if you come on weekends after 5:30pm and they can get very busy  which is a good sign.It's a chain...and geared to families and people who want a decent meal  great beer choices and full bar  and reasonably priced food. It's casual and pleasant.My only complaint would be that the restrooms need tending to more often.All in all  this is a fun  pleasant place to come have a decent meal.(I am only speaking about the ribs...that's all we ever get here.)
Flavia P.,Burlingame  CA,0,1,,1/12/2015,1.0,My boyfriend and I  come here almost every week and we decided to stop by today! We always have a great time  great service. But today wasn't one of those days... We had just a horrible server... She didn't care about taking our order  she was very rude and disrespectful!!! Ohh well I guess  hopefully next time it will be better.
Fashionista M.,New York  NY,2,34,,11/9/2014,2.0,The 2 stars go to our server  who gave okay service. Every time we go here (mind you it's only after watching a movie at the mall's cinema) it truly sucks from the minute you sit down to paying the check. First the host sat us at an empty station (on a busy Sat night which I could only assume a server was on break). That said  a near 10 minutes went by and 5 different servers  2 bussers and the manager passed us without any acknowledgement. The manager  an attractive woman in her late 20's  early 30's passed by at least twice and gave us no attention even though we sat there looking up at everyone waiting for service. I've worked in the industry for years and it's unacceptable. Next  the food is mediocre but we expect that  it's not even a real brewery  but we were starving and tired after the long wait. So  my main issue time after time with this restaurant is the service well lack thereof and the management in my eyes is not impressive. She could have at least stopped for a second to apologize. My friend who works for a secret shopper company will be hearing about my experience.
Steven S.,Daly City  CA,494,87,7,6/30/2013,3.0,BJs is basically another elephant bar except they have way more beer on tap. I've had one really bad experience a couple years back which I still remember til this very day. I order some kind of spaghetti which didn't even taste like spaghetti. It tasted like cardboard with red sauce. It was so terrible that I didn't even eat the majority of it even though I was really hungry. I gave it three stars because if you avoid ALL of the itailan food  the place isn't that bad. The pizza  salad  nachos are all good selections which I recommend. Try getting their beer sampler if your food doesn't taste that good. Everything tastes better when you're drinking!
Amanda S.,San Francisco  CA,91,47,7,8/17/2011,1.0,First time here  and I would NEVER go back to this location!! I went with a group of friends at around 11:30pm one night to grab a bite to eat. I was expecting the same kind of service at any other BJ's I've been to. We were assigned two waitresses--one was a total newbie and the other gave us a dirty look toward us at the end when we wanted to split our checks. Got the vibe that she was racist or something. RUDE. And they didn't even refill our waters at ALL.The new waitress got my boyfriend's order wrong--he ordered Maui Glazed Pork Chops but instead got regular Pork Chops. They redid the order but basically took one pork chop out  glazed the top with sweet and sour sauce  kept the asparagus  and threw in some potatoes that were COLD. Everyone else's dishes were cooked to perfection but I was very disappointed.Thank goodness the waitress got my order of the pizookie right  otherwise I would have raised hell!
Y r.,Daly City  CA,8,67,17,7/1/2011,3.0,If your spending your day shopping and need to grab a bite or go see the niners whoop on the suckas from the other side of the bay here you go. The place is always pack so call ahead they don't take reservations but will put you down on the list like your there waiting. these has come in handy a few times. The menu has the regular staple of burgers  pastas  and pizzas so you cant really go wrong with one of their deep dish pizzas. The bar is always pack so plan to hoover around people till they finish to grab that booth.
Debby D.,Burlingame  CA,3,145,2,5/25/2014,2.0,okay  two stars are... just right for this place. food is cold  service was long  and some people aren't too friendly. the reason is that there isn't a one star is because of the desserts... its the only thing that I didn't mind. but I don't think this place isn't really ideal for a good place for people to have a deep conversation or you want a meaningful meal :-(
Sharon V.,Oakland  CA,195,47,12,8/12/2010,4.0,If you go to BJ's without ordering the Avocado Egg Rolls  you are an ignorant fool.The end.
Joice K.,San Francisco  CA,21,43,110,8/9/2011,5.0,Love the atmosphere  love the food!Chicken wings with ranch dip are our favorite.But I'll never order food that comes with rice anymore. Tried that twice with fish and chicken. They were good except the rice. It was too firm.So next time  I'll go with fries or others than rice.Another flatbread pizza and strawberry margarita would be good on my happy hour session :)
C T.,San Francisco  CA,2,8,2,10/9/2014,1.0,"awful customer arrive or lack of. came in tonight a little after 11pm. we walked in and was not greeted by anyone  so we walked towards a table and a server/busser? was clearing a table and mumble something and pointed us to another area? we were so confused at what he was trying to say but went over to a booth and sat down. they still have a used table cloth in the booth and a tab from previous customer  we stood around waiting to see if anyone would come by but nobody came by. as we sat and waited to be greeted and our menus. we sat and waited and waited some more. after what felt like 10 minutes someone finally came and grabbed the tab from a previous customer  dropped off our menus and said ""you water is on the way  any else I can get you?"" we obviously weren\'t ready and said to give us a few minutes. as we look through the extensive menu on what to order  not once did anyone walk by to see if we were ready or needed recommendations etc. I totally understand its later in the night  they close at midnight  but they were not crazy busy. I say half of the tables were occupied? but most of the folks were done? from what it looked like they had 2 bar tenders  and 2-3 servers and possibly 1-2 bussers? finally a server came by with water! she dropped off 2 glasses of water when we a total of 5 people at the booth! she didn\'t say ""I\'ll be right back with some more water"" or ""we will be right with you"" or anything. just dropped off 2 glasses and dropped off the rest of the waters to another table that was seated AFTER us in a section that was empty when we walked in where someone had mumbled to us and having us sit else where. as the 5 of us sit there staring at the 2 glasses of water and the servers standing around or going back and forth  still nobody acknowledged us or told us they would be with us. we looked around and other tables that were seats after us were having their orders taken  but not once did anyone look our way to see if we needed help or again let us know that they will be with us. we sat and waited and finally I decided I couldn\'t wait anymore. we all finally decided at 11:35pm to leave. 35 minutes for 2 glasses of water and nobody to check on us if we were ready. no thank you. to the management of this establishment  you need more trained and attentive staff. I myself help bar tend and manage a very busy bar nightclub  and everyone that I was with is all in customer service related or hospitality fields and felt the level of service or lack of  was unacceptable. we will NOT be coming back ever. even if you retrain and notify your staff and offered us a discount or a comped meal/drink (cause it would probably take 45 to get that meal or drink) apparently we aren\'t the only ones that feel this way since a lot of the reviews all say the service is really lacking. good luck to whoever manages this place. and especially good luck to whoever tries to enjoy this establishment with some food or a drink."
Liz L.,Pacifica  CA,43,14,1,12/18/2011,3.0,I like going to this especially if its game night!!! Even though it gets really packed and crazy  they have tv almost everywhere. For any other day  the service here varies! Some waiters might be very attentive and others might need to be more attentive. Food are ok. The smoothes are really good! Bar: a wide variety of drinks!!! Bartenders are really nice!!
Diana P.,Fremont  CA,356,159,295,6/15/2011,3.0,I'm always at this BJ's. It's sort of the default if you're in the SSF or San Bruno area  plus  it's open late!There is ALWAYS a wait  but what's cool about this BJ's is during some nights  they walk around and give out free samples of pizza to those who are waiting! The bar area is always pretty busy  but the turn around time is pretty good  so you can usually swoop a booth or hi-top table in this area. I usually order the same stuff: berry burst cider  ahi poke appetizer  flat bread pizza  pizookie. TOO GOOD  I always want to order other things  but I can't seem to stray away from that pattern. Other things I've tried here that have been good: California Club with shoestring fries  chicken Alfredo pasta with broccoli  Best Beginnings Appetizer sampler..I really can't complain about the food - it's really good  at any of the other BJ's I've been to as well (Newark  Cupertino)..I haven't had the BEST experience with servers.. some of the servers I've had have been REALLY bad  I've never complained because I love the food at BJs so much  but some of them straight up forget about you or you're sitting in the area for hella long waiting for someone to take your order that you end up flagging down a different server. Some servers though have been OK  but as far as service goes  in letter grade  I'd give it a C+  and I'm a nice person  so that's giving them the benefit of the doubt that they just don't know how to multi-task or have poor situational awareness or need to be re-trained.I've ordered take out from here  I'd actually suggest that at this BJs. Super quick  never messed up my order  and no wait!Oh  and last night when I ate dinner here with my boyfriend and some friends - they ran out of my favorite  Berry Burst Cider. SO SAD. If you ever come here though  make sure to try it  it's DELICIOUS!
Mark E.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,2,4/20/2012,4.0,"I live in South San Francisco and although it is always tough to get a table within an hour on a Saturday night  this restaurant does a great job when the ""lights"" aren\'t on.If you go for lunch service  you will get in and out with some great deals too.A good add to the area all around"
Simon W.,Walnut Creek  CA,9,87,,9/10/2013,1.0,A pretty awful experience. Ordered an appetizer and two main courses. The main courses of Moroccan fish came pretty quickly but looked like they'd been slapped on the plate and the food was barely warm. The appetizer arrived a few minutes after the main course. The server apologized and was sending the manager over but they never came. Ended the night asking them to call a cab and after 15 minutes they said it was here but it was another customer picking up takeout. 40 minutes later we get our own. Awful service  sub standard food compared to the other BJ locations I've visited. If I could rate it with zero stars I would.
Emily S.,Stockton  CA,286,904,829,6/18/2008,2.0,We ate here a few months ago. It was just okay. Really. We were picking my parents up at SFO and they were delayed at customs. That never seems to surprise me. I rushed to the airport.... pretty much flew my husband's truck over the San Mateo Bridge.... BTW  I hate that bridge. Nice view. But why does it seem to get longer and longer every time? And where do you 'break down'? Especially with maniacs like me on the road flying at 90 mph. Oh... I'm yelping. Sorry. The A.D.D. is in full force this evening. I was just boiling eggs  feeding the dog (not eggs) and playing online black jack and now find myself trying to focus on this fucking yelp.The service was mediocre. The food was just okay. Our table was filthy and getting the check from our waiter was like trying to pry the shotgun from Charlton Heston's cold dead hands  God Bless that man... Charlton  not the waiter. I asked for the check 2 times. Shouldn't happen. I shouldn't have to beg to give you money  asswipe. BTW  yelp headquarters  if you read my reviews  I love the improvements. The star 'roll over' thing  the 'write an update'. I fucking love you people.
Abby E.,San Francisco  CA,124,50,5,10/4/2013,1.0,Bad service. We got there at 11am on a Friday. Note that the place was still empty except for two tables already seated. By 12:15  we were still waiting for our soup  salad and fish tacos. The place was already packed with corporate lunch goers from nearby offices and most of them were eating already!! What's wrong with this picture? When I spoke with the server  he just came up with a bunch a bs excuses.. We even had to ask him for more water. Barely saw him an never checked up on us. When we asked to speak with the manager  he also took while to come over to talk to us. He listened and just apologized-- unconvincingly reassuring us he'll find out what's going on. Don't ever go to this one. What a waste of money. Felt like we could have had a better lunch experience at the Five Guys food court nearby.
Victoria Y.,San Jose  CA,239,678,,4/19/2011,3.0,12:00pm  no wait. However  very busy and I didn't like that we sat in the back but whatever. Lunch is pretty reasonable  and I like the lunch special for the pasta where you can add a salad. I love their wedge salads.The 3 stars were because the waiter brought out the salad and pasta at the same time. And the only time we saw him was in the beginning.
Andrea B.,San Mateo  CA,970,813,1203,3/20/2011,3.0,I have eaten at few BJ's in the past and have never really cared for their food  however my friend wanted to eat here for her birthday  so how could I say no. I ordered Chardonnay Shrimp PastaPlump shrimp  sauted with garlic  basil  onions  fire-roasted red peppers  Roma and sun-dried tomatoes over rotelle noodles in a creamy Chardonnay wine sauce  topped with crisp Applewood smoked bacon  fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley. AMAZING  it was so good! I was impressed!
David I.,South San Francisco  CA,179,7,,12/28/2014,1.0,"Not what it\'s cut out for. This use to be a decent place to eat on special occasions but the service is far from special. This is the second time I call in a reservation and they they ""lost the reservation"" and I\'m places at the bottom of the list  even after speaking to a supervisor. The waiter was nice but forgot about us after a while. ""Second to none."" More like second to RUN!"
Albert W.,San Francisco  CA,84,102,8,7/22/2011,4.0,Good beer  decent food. 4 stars.Got the Jambalaya which was pretty good  but not the best.Prepare to wait on weekends if you want to eat here. Its that many people.
Viel A.,San Francisco  CA,15,18,15,12/17/2010,2.0,This BJ's specifically only gets 2 stars because the other BJs back in my hometown is not like this one.SERVICE SUCKS. For some reason  our orders always take longer than they should take and it takes FOREVER for our waitress/waiter to come greet us and take our orders. Happy hour is a plus but still  this place needs to work on hiring people that give better service.
Stephanie F.,Millbrae  CA,220,25,8,6/2/2011,3.0,"Above all  BJ\'s sure is convenient. For my friend\'s birthday today we couldn\'t decide on a place to go for a ""Surprise party"" luncheon  so when all else fails  you head to the mall. We had a very awkwardly large party of 15  and even though we didn\'t have a reservation  our waiter was great in accommodating our whole party and got us all to fit in one table. I usually like the Pot Roast here  but now they serve some lighter options under 500 calories  so I was suckered into their Tilapia and substituted the rice for a garden salad. Can\'t expect much from baked tilapia so it was pretty bland  and I ended up having a slice of pizza from the girl next to me. Oh and who can forget the pizookie. Ice cream on top of a giant cookie  yummy  but way hyped."
Karina A.,San Francisco  CA,21,205,37,5/31/2013,3.0,Decent happy hour drinks and snacks. But sometimes the drinks do taste a little watered down. I always asked for light ice!
Dave B.,Pittsburg  CA,3,105,,10/22/2013,2.0,It was OK for what it was. Lots of carbs  plenty of fried foods  and plenty of noise in this restaurant. They tried to seat is us in the outside Mall area when there were plenty of seats inside the real restaurant. We sat inside. We sent back their micro beer. It was nothing like a Guinness. My wife drank part of hers. We then ordered wine. The service was good. The place was clean. I ate my food and felt guilty for consuming so many calories. Is BJ's a chain from Texas? It seemed like it could be.
Eugenia X.,San Francisco  CA,47,7,8,8/9/2012,3.0,Came here because of the pizookies and the lunch deals they have from 11-3pm Got here a little too late for that but definitely will come back next to try it. We got seated right away  our waiter came right after I think his name was David. We order fried calamari  stuff mushrooms  mini great white deep dish pizza  the thai mango salad  and one of the mocktails i think it was a peachberry. The food came kind of slow.. our appetizer (fried calamari) didn't come out first  came after everything was served. The mocktail was decorated with a salted rim like how a cocktail would. When I looked at it 3/4 of the glass was filled with ice  tasted watered down. I asked for another one with light ice  and more tea. He came back right away with a new one and it was much better. Fried calamari was a big hit for my boyfriend he loves that stuff  we're always looking for some good calamari. It comes with a ranch dipping sauce and a a lemon aolli. The deep dish pizza was pretty good  it had a lot of toppings on it they weren't being cheap! Thai salad didn't seem really authentic to me. Maybe it's because I know usually it's made with green papays  fish sauce  and soft shell crabs. Instead this was replaced witchili powdeh lettuce  some shredded mangoes  some bell peppers  some chili powder  some avacado  and deep fried wonton stripes. The stuffed mushrooms were my favorite. Small bites with bursts of flavors. After all of that we ordered the mini trio pizookie. White chocolate macadamia  red velvet  and oreo. When they came Ohmygod my boyfriend just grabbed the white chocolate one and NOMED IT ALL.. He was so amazed. They come with big scoops of vanilla ice cream. It works really well because the cookie is baked in a little deep dish  the pan is still hot and the ice cream just melts on the pizookie. It's heaven..The food is pretty good  I love the bar. They have so much choices. They also have happy hour only at the bar area. Our waiter was kind of mia and took some time to notice us. We caught him watching tv lol. Other than that I'm looking forward to visiting again.
Chase L.,San Francisco  CA,96,111,22,9/9/2012,2.0,The food took at least 90 minutes. I'm not talking from the time we walked in... I'm talking from the time we order it. They weren't busy. It was 1130am on a Sunday. The food wasn't bad  but the wait made me lose my appetite. Our waitress was really nice.
Timothy L.,Los Angeles  CA,432,282,128,3/27/2011,4.0,High calorie dense food at it's finest. One person really shouldn't eat a single entree by themselves. But it tastes sooooo goooood!The wait sucks  but I think the wait is supposed to make you more hungry so their food ends up tasting really good.So smart!
Christina X.,San Francisco  CA,42,49,29,10/16/2010,4.0,Oh boy. If you don't like sports  don't come here when the Giant's game is on. There will be a LONG ass wait  and VERY obnoxious fans. Basically just a lot of crowd.. noises. Booo! Yaaay. Etc.I love the food here. But when there's a wait  it really sucks. My favorite is the calamari appetizer and their steak!I don't like their pastas. Their bbq pulled pork sandwich was nasty too. Way too much sauce. I don't really care for their pizzas either. You should try their fresh homemade kettle chips though!
Edom M.,Tracy  CA,0,8,,10/21/2014,5.0,Everytime I have come here the customer service has been amazing  STEVEN has been the best BY FAR  Steven was very attentive on a busy night  & Genuine.
Marissa T.,South San Francisco  CA,32,49,24,5/16/2011,2.0,This could be a great place with the exception of the following:The food is good but at times the service is POOR!. It's also on the pricey side which I am not willing to pay for again with the poor service. Not a very friendly place  from the moment you walk in  unlike other restaurants where everyone who works there seem to be happy you have chosen their restaurant instead of the many others surrounding them  the people who work here seem unhappy :(I'd like to come back because my kids love their alfredo pizza and their pazookie but I'm not  unless these things I have issues with changes...
Lisa H.,San Francisco  CA,97,37,11,7/27/2010,4.0,SIt at the bar! There's no wait at all! Lunch specials are like $7 and you get a TON of food. It was tasty and filling! Plus their pizooki's are so fricking delicous  even if I'm super full i'll make room for one of these! YUMMY!
Miguel C.,Duarte  CA,12,15,5,9/19/2013,1.0,Bad service was told the wait was 20 minutes ended up waiting 40 minutes I then decided to check with another hostess and was told I was never in the waiting list. After this  I went to Chilis and they gave me a table for 5 right away.
jason g.,San Francisco  CA,864,711,103,4/29/2010,2.0,"This is for Happy Hour only.Bj\'s..............Happy hour!!!! How can you go wrong right?!? Please don\'t read between the lines. I am really talking about bj\'s happy hour.Came here with a few of my friends last night and this place is a cool sports bar. Bunch of big screens and the energy here is pretty cool.As for the server and the staff  they need help. Franchise type establishments are known for not having good quality staff. They don\'t seem happy working here. Took 20 minutes to get our drinks and when asked where the drinks? The server would just point and say "" it\'s coming"" and walks away. No apologies  bad body language  and you know she wasn\'t having it today. The funny thing is.........every single one of the servers looked alike and had the same demeanor. They don\'t smile  looked disgruntled  and looked overworked.So  we had 2 drinks and left for Intramuros!!!"
Anriella D.,Daly City  CA,197,65,37,1/7/2013,3.0,2nd time going here  My boyfriend and I went here for date day on new years! 5 minutes of waiting for seating  Great! We got seated. I had the chicken Alfredo pasta  and he got the steak! The date was going great. The waiter was barely around though. Especially when i wanted a re-fill on water. Even waiting for the check and paying took a long time  But other than that it was okay.
Alex A.,Round Lake  IL,5,62,7,6/19/2013,4.0,Great atmosphere  friendly staff and BEER is delightful (good/wide variety of house brew and the standard domestic/import). i always get the pizza-either hand tossed or deep dish and it is always a treat.
Eddie L.,Burlingame  CA,13,30,2,7/30/2011,4.0,BJ's is definitely a go to place for me when I'm in the mood for good Sodas and great food. The wait is always a bit long  but it's expected for a good place like this. My favorite dinner plate has to be either the Spicy Spaghetti with Grilled Chicken  or the Pork Chops  which I recently tried. Another awesome thing about BJ's is its happy hour. I love mini pizzas and their AHI POKE is amazing. You can never go wrong with calamari of course  and their wings happen to be better than Hooters'. Their sodas come in awesome flavors. I've tried Cream Soda  Root Beer  Orange Cream  and Black Cherry  and all of them have NOT let me down. I come here on the regular  enough said.P.S. Pizookies everytime  if not  try the beignet!
Gayle Y.,SoMa  San Francisco  CA,0,14,3,3/4/2014,3.0,Went here for lunch and everything was going well. Until we got to dessert and our waitress told us THEY GOT RID OF THE RED VELVET PIZOOKIE and replaced it with a salted caramel one. It's okayyyy. Not better than the red velvet one though. WHY!!!!!!
Ashley G.,San Diego  CA,51,31,63,6/9/2013,2.0,I've been to many BJ's in the past but this one was one of the worst. It was extremely crowded on a Sunday and the service was very slow. Our waiter left all our plates at the table and rarely cleared it. My advice would be to not come at a regular dining hour.
fitulimaitauese i.,South San Francisco  CA,62,11,4,9/1/2013,3.0,I've been here numerous times. Food is good here! The service is unpredictable though. Sometimes they are quick and food arrives on a timely matter  but sometimes it takes way too long. Three days ago  service was quick and our waitress was awesome. We didnt have to ask her for refills or anything during lunch with 4 other family members. Today  09/31  my husband and I had lunch there and our waiter had us waiting forever after we were seated. i got pissed. i didn't get to eat a pizookie (dessert) because I didnt want to wait again for that.
Alessa S.,Daly City  CA,29,5,,5/2/2012,1.0,"DISCLAIMER: This review is in regards to large events/parties at this location. 1) LIMITED RESERVATIONS FOR FRIDAYS AND WEEKENDS: You have to work with the time they have available for large parties. Because of the busyness at night  they generally only do reservations on Fridays and Saturdays during the lunch/late afternoon schedule  which is really difficult on a Friday considering a majority of people in our party are working  and don\'t get off until 6:00PM. As result  I had to schedule the dinner for a Thursday night. 2) UNPLEASANT STAFF: In arriving at the restaurant  the manager approached a waiter to let him know he would be handling our party. Since finding out  the waiter (I wish I could recall his name and will update once I find it) along with another employee obviously did not want to serve our party. This was apparent in the fact that I heard them talking amongst one another about the burden of serving our large party and the constant disgruntled stares I received which made me feel VERY unwelcomed and uncomfortable. 3) RUDE SERVER: The 1 star review is mainly in part to the HORRIBLE service we received. I understand that our server was unhappy with serving our party  but he didn\'t need to make it so apparent. After the dinner  many people in our party expressed how un-attentive and just plain RUDE our server was. He had an attitude with every one of our guests  which was unnecessary. (Again  once I get his name  I will update) 4) NO BIRTHDAY PIZOOKIE: One of the perks of having a birthday at BJ\'s is you receive a birthday pizookie. Towards the middle-end of dinner I asked our server to please bring out the pizookie with the candle. 30+ minutes pass  it never comes. As he\'s walking by me handing out to-go boxes  I tell him that they never brought it out. He tells me  ""Oh yes  let me go check on it."" Another 30 minutes pass  he comes back with the bill  NO pizookie. I give him my card to pay  and tell him a THIRD time to bring out the pizookie. He takes the bill with my card and says  ""Let me go get it..."" I must have missed him  because when I come back to our table the copy of our check is there and our server LEFT FOR THE NIGHT. NO thank you  NO bye  and NO birthday pizookie for my boyfriend after asking THREE times for it. I then tell another server who walks by that our original waiter never brought it out  and still it never comes. To add insult to injury  upon gathering our things and walking out  another server approaches us at the exit with a to-go tin and says  ""Here\'s your pizookie... TO-GO."" No ice cream  no candle  and cold in a box. What really upset me is the fact that they were never planning on bringing it out while we were there and had it waiting in a to-go box.*The only PRO is the food and alcohol selection they offer at the restaurant. Horrible service and was constantly ignored by the servers! I definitely do not plan on having a large group/party at this location again. For the amount of money and business we gave them  NOT WORTH IT.*"
Nate P.,Daly City  CA,106,127,48,4/21/2011,4.0,"Been here numerous times and reviewing it for the first time. Why? Who cares! :-P Great place to hang out after a long day at work. Food is good. Vibe is excellent..and the drinks are decent. Not fond of the ""measure and pour"" tactics of the bartenders  but they do have rules to abide by. If one is looking to get drunk...either go to real bar or sneak your own bottle in. Just sayin. Oh..and let me just say  if you haven\'t tried a Pizookie...well..try it dammit! It\'ll make you wet yourself. Ya..it\'s that good...."
Anthony S.,South San Francisco  CA,68,6,,6/15/2012,2.0,"I went into this place and waited 30 minutes to sit down. not complaining about that  i knew it was busy and i chose to stay. when i was getting seated  one of the hosts saw his friends walk in and wasn\'t subtle about saying  ""oh let me make room for you"" they didn\'t have to wait. aside from the hostess who I\'m kicking myself for not getting her name  the entire staff was rude to us. we didn\'t get any silverware or napkins  and when we asked a passing waitress for them  she was rude about it too know your busy but come on.Also  a waiter slapped a waitress\'s ass as he passed by her. I didn\'t really want to know these two were hooking up  especially while i was eating. I talked to the manager  but he just apologized and didnt offer to compensate or anything.kind of a bummer cause i like this place."
Sandy L.,Oakland  CA,6,56,,7/12/2011,3.0,Dinner with BF and two of his BFFs. We had a hard time choosing from the menu because everything looked and sounded delicious  but we didn't want to be disappointed. We ordered the Best Beginnings and Ahi Poke and devoured everything. The only disappointment with the Best Beginnings were the mozzarella sticks; I think they were underdone. I loved the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Eggrolls. Yummy!The boys each ordered a giant baked potato and an entree. BJs was not lying about the potatoes - those things were gigantic. I didn't get to sample because I was working on my own entree - Shrimp Scampi. I think they gave me three servings on one plate. Nonetheless  it was delicious (even moreso with Tabasco) and I think the breadcrumbs with the pasta made it a winner.I was disappointed with my Strawberry Mojito. It was gross. The Blonde beer was not bad - I'd drink it again.I took away two stars for the mozzarella sticks + drinks and my super sticky chair. When I left  I noticed my pants and my bag became all sticky - what was up with that?! Ugh. Not exactly how you want your customers feel when they leave.
Mark S.,Hayward  CA,8,146,3,7/7/2013,3.0,Service better than food. Food luke warm to say the best. Fish in tacos small. Pull pork sandwich is mostly bread. Waiter had food prepared as ordered. Unfortunately the food was not hot. It would be a good place if the food was hot. I would only come back if the food would be hot.
Anita P.,San Mateo  CA,0,28,,8/16/2013,1.0,Horrible. Dirty cups and utensils  even after requesting replacements. Serving tacos with liquid avocado in California is stupid and cheap. Second and last time that I will ever go there.
Amanda L.,Pleasanton  CA,0,17,1,12/16/2012,1.0,Horrible. They said I would wait for 15 minuets it took 30 minuets. I have ordered the Bake Mac every time i come hopeing it is better than the last and every time there is something missing whether is the cheese sauce  or the crumb toppings. Once i found an onion in it. It also came with crunchy garlic cheesy bread sticks that this time was a soft plain slice of bread. I also waited 10 minuets for a scoop of ice cream. After I finished the waiter walked by me 4 times before he realized the little bowl I had was on the other side of the table and I wanted the check.  Seriously never going there again!!!!!!!
Angie B.,South San Francisco  CA,0,24,,3/30/2014,1.0,"I used to love BJs for the laid back atmosphere and the fact that I could take the kids and not worry that their talking would bother other guests. We used to be regulars until we went there a few months back and had a horrible experience. Since we come quite often I know what their food should taste like. Our pizza was somewhat burned and after feeding the kids a slice each  I realized it was off. I lifted the toppings and sure enough the top of the pizza dough was slightly burned. No big deal  asked our waitress for another and she was totally cool with it. She went and told her manager and that\'s when the horrible experience started. I believe his name was Tracy  middle aged guy seemed like he was tweaked out on something. He came over very aggressively and said ""so what\'s the problem with your pizza"". I said it was slightly burned and that we wanted another one that wasn\'t. He walked away almost like he was pissed off at us. My husband sensed it right away but I told him no way  that\'s probably his personality--he is a manager after all so there was no way he would treat a customer rudely. After maybe 15 mins our new pizza came out and was much better. Tracey came back and asked how our pizza was (and for that split second I thought  ok cool we were just trippin about his rudeness) and when we said much better he proceeded to say ""ok  it looks the same to me. Let me know if you need anything else"". Are you serious?! Why would I make my starving kids wait for a whole new pizza when there was nothing wrong with it? I was NOT asking for a free one  I just wanted a non-burnt one that I was paying full price for. Total jerk  def on something. Sorry BJs but how do you hire people like that let alone make them managers?! Will not be visiting ANY BJ restaurants because of this experience. Too bad  cuz we were pretty good customers."
Kimiko Q.,San Francisco  CA,27,330,27,2/10/2011,3.0,Monday night dining. Restaurant was only about a third full. Chose this because it was getting late (pushing 9:30) and this place is open till 12am. Unfortunately I was told the kitchen closes much earlier so we couldn't lounge around and see if we wanted more food down the road.Two people. We ordered:Spinach & Artichoke Pizza. Very cheesy. Cream cheese on top. Very skimpy with the spinach. Mostly dried  tiny pieces that resembled the size of cilantro. Not bad but not delicious either. If it weren't a deep dish  it would very much resemble a fast food pizza.Grilled Burger Melt. Extremely greasy. Special sauce that resembled a spicy version of thousand island. And cheese. Lots of it. Me  a meat eater  seriously thought it needed a good dose of veggies (tomatoes & lettuce PLEASE). The skinny fries were good though.Grilled Chicken Pasta (w/Broccoli): Disappointing. I could make this at home. Not enough broccoli. What is it with this place and their ability to withhold anything healthy from dishes? Cream sauce was nothing to write home about. Waitress didn't refill our drinks. I know it was towards the end of our meal but we were thirsty!Average food is average. Oh yeah  we paid about $50 something.
Angela N.,Oakland  CA,296,186,31,3/21/2010,4.0,"The great thing about Yelp Check-Ins  is that I realize how often I forget to review my ""regular"" places.I\'ve been a quasi-regular at this place since it opened in the newly remodeled Tanforan mall. First  for late night noshing when I used to work graves  then weekend lunches when I was on the weekend shift...and now  the occasional mid day get away from work lunch or happy hour drinks and munchies.Great beers and beverages. I love their clam chowder and salad for lunch. The Thai chicken lettuce wraps and their Pulled pork sliders are also delish. Oh  and if you\'re feeling indulgent  their spinach artichoke dip is great too. This is a popular place  so get used to stalking tables at the bar or be prepared for a 30 minute wait. The staff has always been friendly and will occasionally come around with appetizers while you\'re waiting."
Tyler L.,San Francisco  CA,99,82,2,11/24/2012,5.0,Just went to BJ's the other day for my first time and had a great experience! I was kind of surprised because I know it's a chain  but the food and service spoke for itself. I wasnt sure what to order so i asked our service  I think his name was Keith? and he suggested one of their pizzas. Since I already took his suggestion on what beer to have (which was AMAZING!)  i figured i would take him up on his second suggestion. GREAT CHOICE! Great beer  great pizza and great service....3 strikes and you win! Will come back again soon!
Jess W.,San Francisco  CA,66,538,519,12/23/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,For $12 with tip and tax I got the grilled chicken pesto flat bread pizza. It was yummy. I have nothing to compare it to  but it was good.
Erica A.,Austin  TX,519,275,58,9/16/2010,1.0,I really don't like this particular BJs. The food is the same as other ones  so this review is strictly for the service.Our waiter was a tall skinny man. He was friendly at first  I thought everything would be fine. He let us ponder our menus for TWENTY MINUTES. Two people do NOT need twenty minutes to decide what we want to eat. Oh by the way  I WAS STARVING. Thanks  jackass. There were two women at sitting behind us who had just arrived and he was treating them so much better than us.He finally came to take our orders and I asked for water. Did I get my water before all the food? NOPE. So he walks by  and I ask again. He apologizes and goes to the table behind us. He seriously gave them an entire tutorial on how to make their iPhones run faster because the new update made them slow. That took about 10 minutes. I wanted to get up and punch him in the face because NOBODY wanted to hear that. The women didn't even seem interested. They just wanted their food  not your damn advice.So along with being forgetful  he was ANNOYING AS HELL. I saw him the second time I went to this location and I was glad that I was just getting something to go.The second time  I was only getting the ahi poke appetizer because I was starving. So imagine how easy that is  okay? RAW FISH  CHOPPED UP AND MIXED WITH SOME AVOCADO CHUNKS. Well  there were some wonton chips on the side. 25 minutes later  I finally get my food. WHAT THE HELL? I SAT THERE FOR 25 MINUTES FOR RAW FISH. I would understand if you had to cook it  and it went wrong 3 times. BUT ITS RAW FISH. WAS IT KILLED UPON ORDER?On top of the long ridiculous wait  ALL the waiters seemed to just be chillin' at the front of the restaurant. Two of them were even cupcaking and grabbing one another's butt. WHAT THE HELL?
Astha S.,Livermore  CA,0,164,,7/19/2013,4.0,I like food and service here. Best BJ  I hate the foster city and east bay ones... pizookie is my fav  like the sandwiches and fries..
Ben E.,San Carlos  CA,2,11,,9/8/2013,1.0,"We have been a number of times and while I can\'t say I ""hate"" it  I will go to Jack\'s 100% of the time before I go to BJ\'s (much more friendly  family-run  and better quality food).My main complaint is with the service. Over the 6+ times we went there  every single time we had to wait a very long time for a server to come to us and about 75% of the time there would be an error with our order. I ordered a steak there twice and both times ordered medium-rate but it came to me well-done. Very slow service and an unappealing ""corporate"" feel to it. Certainly prefer Jack\'s even if the menu there is not as comprehensive."
Brendan L.,San Francisco  CA,412,180,6,4/24/2011,3.0,Meh...its salty...its slow....its average tasting...went for a happy hour and the drinks where not bad....the food was average....DO NOT get the mini tacos....might as well go to the taco truck across the street to get more food for the price...The skinny fries were good...but got boring fastI have the burgers they are OK.....I got a Snake Bite (guinness+cider) it was good...but my friend got more cider than guinness
Roni L.,South San Francisco  CA,10,329,4,4/23/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,So we call ahead  and we're told there's no wait. We get there 10 minutes later  and we have to wait at least 15 min. More like 25-30... within that time frame  people show up after us  get a vibrator and then get seated before us. WTF???I checked to see WTF was with that  I was told they called ahead  but when I told them I called 10 before I arrived and was told that there was no wait... WTF??? They made some mistake... I can see that happening a LOT  cuz the people who you talk to on the phone are NOT the same people who cue everyone up.Oh yeah  when you try to call ahead and there's no wait  they won't let you put your name down anyways  so the whole call in thing is pretty damn useless.
Andrew G.,Daly City  CA,86,29,5,9/14/2012,2.0,HOW ABOUT A NO. Not only does this place have the longest wait time in like all of California  but the service is pretty bad. This restaurant is a hell hole on Friday & Saturday nights! My friends & I  waited nearly 2 and a half hours one Friday night  just to be told that they are starting to clear up our table & should be seated within another 20-25 minutes. HOW WONDERFUL BITCHES. Once we are seated  our waiter seems to be within the last hour of her shift by never smiling & bringing our WATERS to us 20 minutes later. The food was pretty good  but not worth no hour of wait. IT WAS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS how one half of our party got their food 30 minutes before the other half. I mean like  c'mon people. To hell with this place! We drove up at 6pm  left the restaurant at 1045pm. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! Never again BJ's  never again.
DayDay D.,San Francisco  CA,4,77,,6/10/2010,4.0,Contrary to other yelp reviews  I actually enjoy this place. I understand it is a chain restaurant  but it seems to stay consistent whenever I visit a different one  Fremont  San Bruno  etc. Service is on point  food is good  we usually order the same thing  side salad  xtra garlic dressing on the side  flat bread pizza  mozzarella sticks  and beers. If we decide to try something different  and we don't like it  we speak up  and they are happy to change it to something else or give you a refund. It's easy  SPEAK UP people! Great happy hour specials  and always sit at the bar to get the deal!! Don't wait for a table  it takes too long.
Anthony M.,Austin  TX,0,13,,10/8/2013,4.0,I like their selection of food and the portion sizes. Also a great place to watch sports. However it is a huge chain  so it is ran like one.
Joseph A.,Los Angeles  CA,6,28,9,8/23/2010,1.0,We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and we would have had a better time at the donut shop down the street.Lets start off with the waiter  he was hardly around. I had to lift my hands and hope that ANY waiter came around. Forgot our bread  etc...The BBQ chick chopped salad was dry with no dressing and the pizza my friends ordered had little  if any tomato sauce.Waste of money. Stay away.
Lorianne L.,Daly City  CA,56,3,,8/6/2014,4.0,This is my favorite franchised restaurants. I've tried mostly everything on their menu and it's all good unless they added new stuff. The service is always good here when I come so no problem for me. Pizza is awesome and the dessert here never fails your appetite.
M J.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,0,174,301,3/16/2012,4.0,"My coworkers brought me here a couple of days ago for an ""Admin Lunch and Movie Day"". I didn\'t know what was good to order  so it took me quite a while to look over their menu and decide. I\'m a heavy eater so I ordered their pot roast. It came with white cheddar mash potato and vegetables. It was yummy! I don\'t like too much gravy  so that kind of killed my plate. We ended up ordering their dessert since we had time to spare before our movie started. They\'re famous for their ""pizookie"" (soft  mushy pie cookie in an aluminum pan). I love red velvet  so I ordered their red velvet pizookie. It was a little sweet for me having too much sweet cream cheese and white chocolate chunks. It would have been perfect if it was a little harder. No harsh complaints about BJ\'s. Don\'t really have too much here in the bay area. They\'re all scattered and far from where I live though."
Shirl C.,Daly City  CA,23,80,55,9/8/2010,3.0,I love me some happy hour! I wouldn't pay full price for these even if it was cheap .. but definitely only during happy hour 2 dollars off appetizers from 4-7 M-F Not a fan of everything on the menu just these;*Avocado Egg Rolls *Tuna Tar tare *Potato Chips *Spinach Dip *Fish Taco *Mediterranean Pizza *Bruchetta * Chicken wings (not really cant beat houlahans)
Nicholas G.,San Francisco  CA,1,32,,10/29/2013,4.0,The food here is excellent and the service is great. I take my family here all the time. If you have a child that will need high-chair  be sure to tell them when they put your name down on the waiting list. There have been a few times we've had to give up our table because it would not accommodate a high-chair. Also  the waits are often very long on weekend evenings. You can call ahead to put your name down on the list but that often doesn't seem to help much. For example  we would call and they would quote us about a 30-45 minute wait. When we get there 30 minutes later  they then say it will be another 30-45 minutes. WTF?! The one nice thing about the wait is that you can walk around the mall area a little instead of standing in their small waiting area. I know the buzzer works throughout the Barnes & Noble which is right across from them.
Mary Ann M.,Aliso Viejo  CA,209,278,30,3/22/2011,4.0,Pros: spinach artichoke dip  calamari  ahi poke  deep dish pizzas  and PIZOOKIE! Cons: Long wait for food  sometimes waiters are not too attentive and you have to flag one down to get a refill on your drink  the bathroom isn't always tidy.Despite the occasional customer service downfalls  this is a fun place to eat with good food at decent prices. I also like how they customize my food the way I like it (for example: just the hamburger patty topped with grilled mushrooms  sliced tomatoes and pickles on the side).
Kari G.,San Mateo  CA,231,754,221,11/30/2012,4.0,This is my go to place for delicious pizookie. How could you not love a hot cookie covered in delicious ice cream? I seem to be biased towards their deep dish baking because my other favorite here is the pizza. It comes out in the oven dish piled high with all kinds of goodies. The sweet pig is the best! This BJ's recently added an outdoor patio. It has a big fire pit  plenty of warmers and glass windows around it so that you can stay nice and toasty even in the winter.
kim p.,San Francisco  CA,18,25,,8/1/2011,4.0,i wanted to originally watch the giants game at home  but since neither my bf or i felt like cooking we yelped some sports bars around the ingleside/daly city area. I've only been to the tanforan mall a couple of times but i noticed this brewery on my way to ulta  and finally thought i'd give it a try.the decorum is standard  very clean  airy and spacious. we sat at the sports bar area at a booth and we had 3 tvs to view in regards to watching the giants/reds game that was on. the server was very friendly and accommodating. we ordered the spinach/artichoke dip with chips  fried calamari  small deep dish pizza  potato skins and a side of the friend aritchokes. we had more than enough food  with enough to take home. the pizza tasted just as good even the next day.
Mertani G.,San Francisco  CA,0,271,,8/17/2012,3.0,"I\'ll come here just for the red velvet pizookie! Sooo many calories  but i don\'t care! I\'ll eat it on my ""cheat day."" If you\'re ordering off of the enlightened entrees  don\'t eat the mediterranean pasta. It was so bland! yuck!"
Leana L.,San Francisco  CA,321,877,281,6/30/2010,1.0,We came here once before and had to wait terribly long for both our food and the bill  so we didn't have very high expectations when coming here again. However  BJ's surprised us once again and this time we had even worse service. (If you're wondering why we even bothered to come back  we came here per the request of a coworker who was celebrating her last day -- and the reason why she chose this place was likely b/c she had a gift card to BJ's)After setting us up with waters  our waiter took our appetizer order and then told us to hold off on ordering our entrees so that he could put in the appetizer order. A good 10 minutes later  he came back to take our entree order. A coworker and I chose a salad to share (when he ordered for us  he pointed to the large size and even emphasized that we were sharing). About another 10 minutes later  our appetizers came and then about 15 minutes after that  our entrees arrived  all served at once by a few assisting waiters. When our salad came  it was the tiny lunch portion! We sent it back since it obviously wouldn't be enough for both of us  and emphasized that we ordered the full-sized portion. After waiting another 10 minutes while everyone consumed their food  we asked the waiter what happened to our salad. Apparently there was no communication and he didn't even know we sent our salad back to get a full-sized order! So he had to go and put in another order. Abut 10 minutes later  when our coworkers were done with their food  we asked again about our salad. He said it would be ready in 5 minutes  so we asked that it just be packed up to-go. However  when another 10 minutes passed and everyone was ready for the bill  we were so fed up that we decided to cancel our order. Finally 5 minutes later  our waiter came to us with the bill and our salad packed to-go. He said we had a choice to make: we could take the salad or not take the salad and he would deduct it from our bill.Even after such poor service  he wasn't going to offer the salad for free or at a discount! We were so over the thought of eating an over-priced salad that we declined and opted to just grab food from our much cheaper on-site cafeteria at Genentech.This is definitely the last time I'll ever go to this BJ's again.
William B.,San Francisco  CA,3965,476,3570,3/25/2012,4.0,Its my very first time ever that... I have ever eaten dinner at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse of San Bruno... I have past by BJ's to many many times and have not eaten there... Except for buying a souvenir beer mug during the holidays of 2011 and used the restrooms many many times... Butttt until today  I finally walked in into BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse on a sunday night which was still day light with my family... When I got inside it was a little crowded at the time... The hostess told us it would be a half hour wait in which it didnt take that long of a wait... There were alot of customer that have left BJ's so that gave us a table of four without waiting that long... When we got seated by the hostess in which so was very friendly!!! As soon as we sat at the table... I was ready and I ordered myself a Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak... Which came out nice and hot I definitely would wanna come back to try another item to munch on the next time I come back... And one more thing like in some of my other yelp reviews... The restrooms of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse of San Bruno isnt that bad... I have used it before and it isnt really really that dirty!!!
Melissa G.,Chicago  IL,27,23,,4/19/2013,1.0,My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night  place was pretty busy but didn't seem too chaotic.We asked how long the wait was and the host told us about 15-20 minutes  she gave us a pager and told us we could walk around the mall but not too far. After 45 minutes we asked the host what was up and how much longer she thought it might be. She seemed a little flustered and said soon. I noticed some people just walking in and sitting at tables near the bar so I asked if we could sit up there and she said yeah all that is open seating  would have been great to know that to begin with but accidents happen and she probably just forgot to remind us or maybe thought we had been there before.The food was okay but some of it was definitely frozen and not fresh or made in house. They have a ton of beers on tap which were all pretty good. Service was okay  server didn't really check back on us  which kind of ruined it for me because I ordered fettuccini alfredo and it had been sitting in the window for a while because the plate was super hot when it was delivered and the all the sauce had dried up and the pasta was stuck together. We were almost done and the server came to ask if we wanted any desserts but I asked if he could bring me a side of alfredo so I could finish my dinner. He did and apologized for the way it came out but we never saw a manager nor did one come to our table. Next time I will probably only go to have beers & appetizers on their patio.
Chris C.,Las Vegas  NV,18,17,,7/20/2013,2.0,For a place that prides itself on its pizza  this was an unacceptable experience. I ordered the BJ specialty pizza  expecting a deep dish. I did not get a deep dish (perhaps that was my fault for not checking to see)  but what was worse was the fact that the pizza was soggy on the bottom. The top was cooked okay  but the bottom was soggy. The pizza was placed on a large place which may have been the reason  but the pizza was lukewarm and the bottom was soggy. It was pretty gross.My mom ordered desert and got their beignets (I can't remember how to spell the name). It tasted very generic. Too sweet  very plastic  very processed. It didn't taste fresh  it tasted heated up. I've had a number benaitslkwoiaiasdf from New Orleans to Disney World to fairs and farmers markets  but that was probably the tackiest benaipwnapsifjasl I've ever had.I've been to other BJ restaurants that were much better. The service was okay  but I definitely had to work hard to get some attention from our server.
Sun T.,San Francisco  CA,7,198,35,3/5/2011,3.0,I usually stay away from chain restaurants but ... ya know for a chain restaurant its not bad at all.Came here for a last minute b-day dinner because no one in SF would accommodate 20 last minute guest =POrdered the Jambalaya and a Pilsner to combat the spicy kick from the Jambalaya. BJ's version is dry and heavily spiced. I wish they offered touffe but then again it probably wouldn't taste so great since its a chain restaurant.Some people ordered the deep dish pizza and it looked pathetic. More bread and crust instead of generous toppings. There were appetizers but nothing memorable. I probably wouldnt come back. In all honesty I only went because my friend ex-boyfriend was there and she needed a skilled c*ck blocker. Its the least I can do because she's my wing girl. =D Otherwise I would've stuck to the original plan which was dinner in SF with a smaller group and everyone would meet at Roe. Ps: Roe sucks. avoid but if you must then bring good people with you and drink heavily because you'll want to forget the idiots you encountered earlier in the evening. IE: when you were sober. =P
Dalia M.,Lincoln Park  Chicago  IL,177,483,9,10/27/2008,4.0,Been here a few times. Wait is always an issue when we've gone but most of the time we have been lucky enough to find a seat at a bar booth/table.Waited once for about 20 minutes at around 8pm. The food is good  well priced and service is always really attentive and nice.They have their own beers which my boyfriend loves! Always go here when we're in the area.
Rachel H.,San Francisco  CA,80,391,,1/15/2013,3.0,This place is huge  but it is always so busy! Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes if you come here for dinner. The service isn't that great  but the food is consistently good. There is great variety  so there's something for anyone.
Bella B.,San Francisco  CA,360,589,357,1/31/2010,2.0,What is the hype? I don't get it....the drinks were the best part of the $100+ meal... Had the skins (ok...) the spinach dip (yum) and the balsamic chicken (yuk) and my boy had the country fried steak (I liked it  but I could have made better) and we tried one of their pizzas which was pretty decent. But honestly for a 45min+ wait - it was just not worth a return trip for me.
Leslie P.,Torrance  CA,70,999,1145,4/7/2010,3.0,i used to come here a lot. and by a lot i mean 2-3 times a year. haha i usually like to try new places  and not frequent chain restaurants. but i would come here when my friends would roll deep like no other. this is a good place to have 20-30 people for birthday dinners  which is why i came all the time. my friends loved setting up dinners here for big groups! the food: it's a brewery/restaurant  so expect american bar food. i liked the blackened chicken pizza. it was piping hot when it came out! most people come for the pizookies. it is basically a giant cookie pie brought to your table hot & fresh  topped with scoops of icecream (cookies n cream or vanilla). it's yummy  but VERY simple to make. and being a passionate baker myself  i usually don't rave about desserts that are easy to make  like this one. it's even easy for non-bakers... just buy premade cookie dough from your local grocery store  throw it onto a cake pan  smoosh it down a bit and bake. top with store bought icecream and ta-da! a homemade pizookie!
Carina M.,Seattle  WA,271,964,156,9/12/2010,1.0,I've finally figured it out. I've analyzed my relationship with BJs because I've been coming here steadily (well  steadily across CA and AZ) over the past 8 years.I've always loved their salads. Always. I've sung their praises. I've written haikus over their pizookies. It was that good for me.Five years ago we moved out of the country for a year and then landed back in the US  this time in AZ. Low and behold...near our sketchy apartment was a BJs! YAY! (yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaur) Salads made me happy. Pizookie made me happy.Beer for hubby? Not so much.We moved in AZ  buying a home. In that area  just up the 202 towards Chandler  we found another BJs that was located in a mall. Hubby  being the beer man he is  was excited because this is the BJs where they brewed their beer and distributed to the other BJs across the state (or so he read in his research). Plus  the brew master worked there 5 days a week. I think he was having visions of beer discussions. Anyway  here is the review I wrote for that BJs - yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaur Their service and salads sucked in the times we went. We stopped going there.Cupertino BJs  here's your review I wrote - yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaur - despite the fact I've been here at least 10 times. I finally remembered to write a review thanks to the handy check in thing for Yelp on my iPhone.And this place  the San Bruno location  is the BJs that put the nail in the BJs coffin for us...We will not come to a BJs ever again. It's being removed off of our chain food list.How did BJs screw it up so feckin badly for us?A) The Beer. Over the years we've had consistently shitty tasting beer  but when BJs get their beer right we immediately overlooked 4 years worth of bad beer. But do we really want to wait every 4 years to have one good beer make up for the others? No. Like I said  we've finally figured it out. Just a note: if you're going to say you're a brew house/brew pub  your beer had better be fucking stellar. Fat Tire is not the be all end all. Fat Tire is one step above MIller High Life for n00b beer drinkers (that stunning analogy came courtesy of beer lover and consumer Matt) who think they know their brew. They don't. They really don't.On a final note  we don't know what the hell all the BJs do  but somehow  their beer consistently tastes old and stale. Like it sat out in the sun before going into refrigeration. How can all the BJs manage to screw it up? Maybe it's the distributor they use  but when you somehow manage to screw up a Guinness on tap  you're in big trouble.B) The Food. Over the years the food has gotten saltier. While I still enjoy their salads  I can't really deviate from anything else because the salt content is so high it adversely affects me - my fingers swell  I drink a gallon of water and then spend the rest of the day (or night) on the toilet. Sorry if it's TMI.C) The Service. I know that my husband can be fussy about his beer. He's not shy about sending it back. I'm not shy about sending my food back  either. We're not rude any time we've had to do it. But for some reason  the moment we do it  our table becomes a ghost town - completely devoid of service. On several occasions we've almost walked out because we were kept waiting for 20 minutes before our server would come back. This not only happened at this BJs  but the Cupertino and Chandler  AZ  one as well.Anyway  long story short...stick a fork in BJs for us. It's done. We won't be coming back.After 8 years  I'm finally kicking your restaurant to the curb. No more making excuses. I will no longer be a victim to your bad food  bad beer and bad service any more.
Ali L.,San Francisco  CA,52,112,1,1/5/2011,3.0,This place is kinda like the last Jennifer Aniston movie I saw---I can't really remember how and why I got roped into the suffering. We came here to kill some time because of my severely delayed flight and I found myself drowning my sorrows in their killer micro beer selection. Seriously  they have Goose Island Matilda. We ordered their flatbread to share and I got their pulled pork sliders. Blah. Nothing memorable. But I will remember the $50 I dropped on lunch for two.
Emily G.,San Francisco  CA,0,15,,10/13/2014,4.0,Celebrated my husband's 30th Birthday here. It was a great evening. It was loud and busy as I expected because of the post season Giants game. I reserved a table so we did not have to wait. The server was great. Very helpful and attentive. Our food was very good. I ordered the pares an chicken. With garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. My husband ordered a steak. It came out perfect. We had a large party and 3 kids with us and you could tell they were busy but they still brought out great food and overall it was good. The only negative would be the kids macaroni and cheese. Looked and tasted like kraft. That was a disapointment. But other than that it was a great evening with great food and great service!
Kimberly Y.,San Francisco  CA,193,19,68,2/19/2011,4.0,Well the best thing about this place is the PIZZA. I was never a fan of deep dish but after BJ's i loved deep dish. Not that I really like deep dish and I would never eat deep dish anywhere else but this place is the bomb. I got the sliders and they were great. The french fries were thinly cut and divine. Every time i go to BJ's i get the strawberry lemonade and it was delicious. and THE GREATEST thing was the PIZOOKIE. Large cookies  melt in your mouth  and scrumdidliumcious(how do you spell that?) with ice cream on top made it one of best desserts i have ever tasted in my life. If you go there you it is a must order. The staff was okay. Nothing special but cordial. It was kinda loud and the food took a while to come but the pizookie made it all worth it.
Connie Y.,Fullerton  CA,172,139,114,11/25/2010,4.0,Delicious  good food. Great service  clean environment  &warm smiles everywhere. The prices are not that bad since the portions are big. Don't forget to order a pizookie after your meal ! *drools.
Kat C.,San Francisco  CA,638,625,2332,10/11/2008,3.0,Dude  their happy hours last till 8ish on a weekday...balls! Too bad it's not downtown...The food is decent - I'll be satisfied with the chili cheese fries  hot wings  a beer  and a salad (for balance) Haven't had a pazookie in forevers BUT I do crave it after I've had a salty meal or around 12:43am on a drunken Saturday night after eating taco bell while on my way home. It's kind of expensive...there's definately a list of other places I'd prefer to eat than BJ's. Service is usually pretty good and the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time...man  it's just alright.I DO recommend the hot wings and a cold beer...can't go wrong  son!
Joanne G.,San Francisco  CA,356,650,62,8/16/2008\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Who else goes for drinks at 11AM? Uh  me. Alright  so I've discovered that BJ's really isn't that bad- apparently it just took copious amounts of alcohol to finally warm up to this place. I needed to kill some time before my very delayed flight at SFO and thus ended up at Tanforan and BJ's.Tried their beers for the first time- I had the Brewhouse Blonde  he had the Hefeweizen. Not bad at all. The super nice bartender gave me a decent sized tasting on the house  and she even brought out some silverware when I asked if it was alright for me to finish up my airport lunch!Three orange stars for the awesome bartender.
Jon C.,Daly City  CA,0,8,1,9/6/2014,1.0,9-6-2014 the service has been much better in the past. It has gone down hill! The waiters seem like they could care less the food is ok! I will not return. I will go to the. Cheese Cake Factory instead for better food and service for our party of six!
Brandon J.,Fremont  CA,1,21,1,8/26/2013,1.0,"Hmm...what can I say about this place. BJ\'s is a great place with great food  just NOT at this location! Went in this past Saturday  and it was the worst experience. It was my birthday and I wanted a great lunch...Well it didn\'t happen! Got there and was seated immediately...Our server took our drink orders and 15 minutes later she still hadnt returned. Another woman came with drinks finally and announced herself as the ""new server""...She took our orders  but never returned...She comes back with another server named John...and said he was the ""rightful server""...I guess they name themselves all the special names. We were hungry and just wanted our food at this point...Our food finally did come...But our appetizer(avocado rolls) came AFTER our main entree. The manager came to our table with a blank face and simply stated  I will take these off the bill for you...He acted like he was doing us a favor for their mistake. Our food was under-cooked  and sent back! Im assuming they were short staffed  which is common  but you should NOT seat people in areas where there is NO help. We would of been content on just waiting or going to another nearby restaurant...at this point  a Big Mac would of been better than the mess we were served! Although our food was under-cooked and cold  we still paid our bill and tipped John more than 18%...it wasn\'t his fault. He tried to do damage control but it was too late. I would suggest anyone coming here think twice about it...And if you feel like you just have to eat BJ\'s right now  select John as your server."
Jessica O.,Burlingame  CA,0,14,1,10/27/2011,1.0,The food is good BUT THE SERVICE IS B.A.D!!!!!! Not good for large groups because it will take a while to get seated plus when we get seated no body great us to what to drink or even give us menu for like pass 20 min. Then we all just walke out after that. DO NOT COME HERE GO TO ELEPHANT BAR IN SERRAMONTE OR IN BURLINGAME MUCH BETTER SERVICE.
Rebecca N.,San Francisco  CA,3,37,1,6/16/2013,1.0,"Five things about this place: 1. One time  I ordered a salad and I FOUND A HAIR IN IT! I didn\'t even get to eat it. Lost my appetite by the time they ""remade"" my order. It was poorly plated the first time around and even uglier the second time around. It seemed as if they removed the hair and added more dressing to the plate since my lettuce was soggy. 2. Service is terrible unless the place is empty. If it\'s a busy day  don\'t expect your food to come quickly. You\'ll be waiting forever. 3. The servers love to socialize...with other servers. 4. The servers are too scripted. It\'s scary. 5.Every time I\'ve come here  my food has been lukewarm. Terrible. I can\'t even..."
Vivienne M.,San Francisco  CA,31,5,2,4/6/2010,4.0,I went out to BJs with my husband last night! It was a hit..I had the Parmesan Crust Chicken while he had the Balsamic Chicken Dinner...I really enjoyed my meal. The waiter was very friendly and attentive.The wait time was pretty minimal for a Monday evening (30mins)...Do try the Pomegranate Margarita..(ask for extra lime to even out the sweetness)...it was really DELIISH!!!Thanks for a warm setting and an awesome-wholesome meal!
Aman K.,San Francisco  CA,0,33,,7/31/2013,4.0,One of my favorite spots in SF to just eat  talk and enjoy the evening. Great menu with a lot varieties from food to dessert to drinks. Pazookie (dessert) is a must for me at this place. The only reason i am not giving 5 starts is because of the wait and slow service during the weekend.
Jer W.,San Bruno  CA,75,277,,9/22/2013,4.0,My friend called me to join here at bj on 9-22-13 1pm'sh for the 49er game. I was able to snag a table at the bar area in front of the large tv screen. This waitress was courteous/patient  I told her my friends will be joining me shortly. I ordered the hefeweizin pitcher $16.75 and a classic burger about $9'sh. Surprisingly the food is good (of course the experienced cook was there). Afterwards  ordered 1 pint of bj hef for $4 (reasonable prices/good service). My friend had to speak to the mgr several times regarding the 9er game (where's the volume  should be a bigger screen for our home team (he eventually listened to him and he hear the other customers complaining).
Justin G.,San Mateo  CA,18,125,17,1/8/2013,1.0,The night started off okay even though we had a party of 8 and they wanted to break us up in 2 separate tables away from each other really OMG not cool I like to be together with family not separate I ordered the flatbread pizza without tomatoes then it came with tomatoes. We were there for my niece's birthday and I wanted to surprise her with a nice desert with a candle at the end of dinner and THE WAITER told me that they don't SING happy Birthday???????????????? (Some policy). they bring it while we were in the middle eating WOW WRONG not when she was eating her appetizer then they forgot our calamari which the waiter did not charge us this place is worse than Cheesecake Factory in San Mateo YOU ALL LOST A CUSTOMER
Judy C.,San Francisco  CA,94,113,61,1/7/2013,2.0,I came here several years back for a friend's birthday and we had to wait quite a while because we did not have reservations and had about 10 people. I ordered a Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and it was totally not worth it  it was $14 without tax. The fettuccini was pretty mediocre  no wow factor present at all. I wonder if it's because I've order the wrong dish and if there were other better dishes here? I don't know...Sadly I felt like I could have had the same dish for a cheaper price and better tasting elsewhere. I can't say I'd come back unless invited to come. Hopefully by then  I can figure out what there is to order correctly..
Ally C.,San Francisco  CA,238,184,96,2/21/2010,4.0,"Personally I don\'t think you can ever go wrong with BJ\'s. When all else fails  I\'d like to say that I fall back on BJ\'s-- but strictly for the food  not the service.I have yet to try a plate from BJ\'s that will leave me with a sad face. So far I\'ve tried a multitude of dishes  from their chicken wings  chicken parm  pizza  avocado spring rolls  Santa Fe spring rolls  spinach & artichoke dip  sandwiches  the list goes on and on and not once has any of these dishes left me thinking I\'ve made a mistake. The one thing that everyone needs to try when going to BJ\'s is definitely the pizookie. It\'s such a simple dessert concoction that one can easily make at home  but for some reason even knowing that I can simply save money and make my own  never stops me from getting one at BJ\'s. I think the reason why is because whenever I get one  I get one for free. The technique to doing so is to simply tell your server that it\'s your best friend\'s birthday while she\'s stepped out to the bathroom and VOILA you\'ve got yourself a free divine dessert with no extra charge! Trust  it never fails... until one day BJ\'s management reads my Yelp entry and decides to enforce a ""check your ID to clarify your birthday"" policy. Great...Anyway  I stressed earlier that I come to BJ\'s for their food and not their service because I\'ve had a handful of loony servers for the last times I\'ve been here. Personally I think there\'s a difference between being friendly and being overly crackheaded happily friendly. The last two times I went here I had one of those servers which left me feeling reluctant to ask for another glass of water so I wouldn\'t have to hear how my server loved the new Lady Gaga album and how she\'s a ""free bitch"" and have to hear her sing broken lyrics to such a fine song. Geez lady  please let me enjoy my meal in sweet solitude with the occasional drink refills and ""how\'s your meal"" next time. Thanks!"
Jun W.,Daly City  CA,11,117,,2/14/2011,4.0,Went there on Sat. with gf with a waiting time of about 30 minutes. But the wait was well worth it. Service was excellent  the waitress was very nice and friendly  and comes over to check if everything is ok every 10 minutes. We ordered spinach stuffed mushroom and ahi poke for appetizer and chicken masala for main dish for sharing. Taste was good  especially stuffed mushroom and quantity was about right  in addition to fair price. Overall  worthy place for a weekend visit and will want to go back there in a few months again.
Robert Y.,Sacramento  CA,40,834,15,1/2/2011,3.0,surprisingly this was my first time going to this particular chain restaurant as Ive driven by several of these places during my time as a pharmacy student.Anywho  this place is basically a somewhat typical American restaurant that is supposedly known for their deep dish pizzas  selection of mixed drinks and ales. and their large cookie dessert. I tried their deep dish pizza and I was not impressed. Theres too much dough and seemed to lack enough sauce as it seemed dry. I didnt try anything else but my friends got the 1/2 lb burger and the Jambalaya which looked decent but not worth the price. I think Id rather go to oliver garden if I had a choice between chillis  sizzler etc. Not impressed but will give a second chance as its seems like a good place for birthdays and large groups.
Peter T.,San Diego  CA,278,807,324,8/18/2008,5.0,"i come here with co-workers maybe once or twice a month and are considered valued patrons by the bar-staff. Just as any ""regulars"" at a bar  we expect excellent service and have never received anything less. Every food item i have tried was pretty solid  i just tried the California something rather sandwhich on grilled sourdough tonight and it was delectable. Roasted green chili\'s  pepper jack  chicken  chipotle mayo  what more could you ask for?Drinks are also poured and served well. Johnny black + the nit wit are my favs. This particular location tends to get a bit busy so i suggest attending with an open and flexible mind. It is well worth it!"
Heidi S.,San Francisco  CA,8,190,2,11/7/2010,3.0,Every time we come here  there's always something very specific from the menu we have in mind. Baked potatoes  the blackened chicken pasta  jambalaya  wedge salad or the Berry Burst Cider. The wait is atrocious  any time after 6:30  plan on waiting an hour and a half easily. Plan on having to come back after 20 minutes to get your pager. Plan on them not actually having one ready. There's a lot of planning that has to take place. It's a shame that Tanforan doesn't have more exciting mall type shops that make waiting forever worth it. Cheap  super trendy shops just don't have anything to offer me and sitting in Barnes & Noble browsing books for extended periods of time is fairly dangerous. On our last visit  we noticed that they added another aisle to the dining floor and as a result have probably 16 more booths for parties of 2. Sadly  this didn't have an affect on the wait. The wait staff is really hit or miss. Sometimes you get 3 water refills  sometimes you're left high and dry no matter how many times you ask for more. They have a decent menu and great drinks (except that literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I have ordered a Mojito they have been out of mint!).
Tiffany S.,San Francisco  CA,210,277,70,4/19/2012,2.0,first time having drinks at BJ's! had a taste of their blonde ale and it was okay. Not terrible but not memorable either.
Andrew Y.,San Francisco  CA,176,1352,,4/20/2010,2.0,We showed up at around 9:15PM on Saturday night. It was busy...but how busy  we did not actually know. Before we walked in  there was a flood of people leaving presumably watching the Giants game. However  when we got in  we were told the wait was going to be about 45mins to an hour. So we were okay with that since we were waiting for some friends  but then our friends showed up about 30 mins later. This was fine  but then as 1 hour approached  suddenly our time was pushed another 30-45mins. Needless to say  we were not all thinking happy thoughts. After a while  we began taking over seating as they became free within the bar area. It did get to the point where we were all pretty much seated and ordering. Here's the sad part  we ended up getting seated at a table for 12 (which we needed)  but 2 of our guests had already left because it was too late. And as we walked to our tables  we noticed a slew of empty tables next to the table we were going to be seated at. Anyway  we decided we'd waited this long and we went ahead an ordered. Though we were left hanging out for almost 2 hours  we made the best of it. I'm pretty sure had we sat earlier we would have spent more. I guess there isn't strength in numbers. Other BJ's locations I've been to  all good. Especially the one in San Mateo.
Anthony P.,Daly City  CA,12,35,,2/22/2010,4.0,Luv the happy hour. The beer was good  but really luv the $5 whiskey on the rocks. I came out with my girl and her co-workers and friends. We had a great time parlay and drinking. Looking forward to try the dessert next time. Luv the deep-dish pizzas and the wedges.
Jory S.,San Francisco  CA,179,118,2,1/29/2011,4.0,Great beers  great place to watch sports  food is pretty good. If you're looking for mainstream american food with a couple of creative twists at very fair pricing- this is the place. The staff is hit or miss- the gal who ran our food to our table nearly threw it down and grunted something as she ran away. Our bartender was attentive and and upbeat though.
D M.,Vallejo  CA,212,19,11,12/17/2009,1.0,"This review has nothing to do with in-restaurant service. This review is for service over the phone. I called this morning to ask when was happy hour and what were the deals for that time. The person I spoke to was able to answer my first question  "" 3 to 7."" So no big deal. Great  he answered my question. But when I asked him what the deals that went on during happy hour. The only thing he could say was  ""I\'m not really sure."" Then there was this awkward silence. I thought  ""seriously  you can\'t ask someone. WTF."" Then he ask  ""Is there anything else I can help you with?""I said no. I was shocked by the whole thing. It\'s one thing you don\'t know the answer to something  but to not even try to find the answer was inappropriate in this setting."
MJ R.,Menlo Park  CA,3,89,,12/23/2009,1.0,-1 stars for watered down drink-1 stars for cold wings-1 stars for undercooked wings-1 stars cuz now im SICK AS A DOG the next dayI'm done w/ BJ's.
Denise C.,Pacifica  CA,3,51,,6/24/2011,3.0,Came here with my boyfriend  The atmosphere was fun The lighting is nice too. This place kinda reminds me of Jillians/TGIF's. EXACTLy. It's more of a group  hanging out with friends place. My boyfriend ordered a pasta w/chicken dish. I took a bite. It was decent but noithing special  I just orderd the seared ahi appetizer  $4.oo for 6 little pieces. It was ok  I had better. Oh..before i forget  for dessert order the snickerbobblethinga majigger. Not sure how to say it but its a chocolate cookie still in its pan with ice cream om top..........YUMMY!! Nice thing to share with your love monkey.Anywhoo   i would go back but it would not be my first choice.Love D
Emily L.,San Bruno  CA,0,5,,9/5/2014,2.0,The service needs to be improved. One of our 3 meals was completely wrong  Im allergic to yellow cheese so i asked for white cheese and friend jalapenos on my burger.The waitress never came to check on us until we were almost done. Some busser sent our food back  the burger came back with yellow cheese still melted all on the sides and soggy half friend jalapenos. Whatever i can deal.. The waitress shows up to refill my water glass  with no ice  So I asked for ice and she came back with a huge glass full of ice slammed it on the table with the biggest attitude. After waiting for over 30 min for our check still no sign of our waitress so I went to track her down. Only could find the hostess  who sent a new person with out check. We were on the patio because we had a dog  after we had our bill and were getting ready to leave  the waitress brought out a small bowl of water for our dog. WTF!! why would you wait till we are leaving. The umbrellas were also set up  but the wind was blowing like crazy  there were more then a few times my fiance had to catch the umbrella from falling on our table or hitting one of us in the head!! I'm very disappointed with this service  especially since it was so expensive. Seems that the staff needs some more training on customer service and listening to the customer.
Lina W.,San Francisco  CA,27,42,,11/27/2010,3.0,Is it just me  or does BJ remind you of a Cheesecake Factory or a Grand Lux Cafe?? Anyways  I'm usually not a big fan of these chain restaurants with their overwhelming menu  but BJ is great when you want to catch any sports game on one of their many TVs. In fact  if they're not showing it  they will offer to change the channel for you. Their customer service is excellent. I would give them 5 stars on just their service alone (but had to take away a star for their pizookie... so sweet it'll make your teeth hurt!)I came here the past 2 weeks and enjoyed the BBQ pork sliders and artichoke + spinach dip. Both were great! (I don't know why I said I don't like these chain restaurants... food was good!)
Alicia R.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,2,8/29/2015,1.0,"I don\'t expect much from people who work at restaurants. I used to work in one so I know it\'s tiring. However the service here is probably the worse I\'ve ever seen. I took my mom here for lunch during a week day and we got seated pretty quickly. The host said Mark or Matt or something would be our server  we waited for about 15 min for him to at least ask if we wanted something to drink but instead he went to a table that got seated ten minutes after us. I made eye contact and said ""excuse me"" where he then LOOKED AT ME AND THEN LOOKED AWAY. I waited for him to finish taking their order but instead of coming over to us  he left. WOW!! I can understand if it was a busy day  but it wasn\'t  I can understand if it was loud and he didn\'t hear me....but it wasn\'t. Like I said I dont expect much   I just expect them to do their jobs. So we walked out and went to five guys in the food court and got ten times better service than both times I\'ve been to BJ\'s."
Frankie L.,San Francisco  CA,29,82,1,4/8/2010,3.0,OK food.OK service.OK beer.OK environment.Not so OK wait time.Very average with a couple of goodies on the menu. The pizzas are pretty good and the portions are huge. I just hate waiting forever for a table. The service there is a bit slow for my likings ... 3 stars A-OK
Crystal Marie O.,Vallejo  CA,112,13,,10/1/2010,2.0,I've been to this BJ's a total of 4 times and EACH TIME I've been here  I have almost slipped! Their floors are toooooo slippery  like seriously. I actually slipped in their bathroom BUTTTTT I didn't fall on my ass  I luckily caught my balance and grabbed onto the women's stall.The service was okay  attentive to myself and others that I was with. However  one female server was a bit sloppy and just didn't seem to care for our table. The size of the place isn't too bad  rather large; there is a wait on busy days as it is connected to Tanforan Mall. I think the only reason I'll come back here is for their PIZOOKIE. Other than that  their damn floors are tooooo SLIPPERY!
Fifteen F.,San Francisco  CA,4,25,3,1/20/2010,2.0,Ok food for above average prices. I hate the clientele there though. And the bartender chick likes to show off her tramp stamp. Word.
Marisa R.,San Francisco  CA,200,195,16,8/2/2010,4.0,Plus one star for serving Pepsi products!Plus one star for good clam chowder. Let's just say you get clam in every bite.Plus one star for great baked potatoes! Cheddar  bacon  butter and sour cream? Yes please!Plus one star for their Pasta! Simple yet tasty!Minus one star for the wait and for slow service. I seriously think that we got reasonable service about once.But  positives outweigh the negatives. I love BJs. haha.
Lina L.,Alhambra  CA,210,156,152,8/18/2010,4.0,Luckily BJ's was only like a 2minute walk from Speedee--while we waited for the car to be done we went to grab some lunch. all the BJ's look actually the same to me. Enjoyed being there no wait & the services were faster than Speedee that's for sure!
Scott C.,San Francisco  CA,41,23,4,12/19/2010,3.0,I go here A LOTthe food is okay prices are a bit high  service usually sucksbut I keep going back so it cant be terrible;)The one waitress Jazz or Jazzy or whatever her name is  is awesome and a great server and not to mention cute :)  had her twice and she was the best server there by far.
Kristen S.,San Francisco  CA,544,907,492,1/22/2008,3.0,Your typical burger joint. Choices in San Bruno are limited.... otherwise I can't think of a single reason to go to BJ's. I have to say  though  that their chunky seasoned fries are really  really good. Pure satisfaction in each and every one of them. For that alone they deserve an extra star. But then again  that's also a reason to NOT go there.
Teresa S.,San Francisco  CA,6,5,2,1/23/2013,2.0,"Deja vu - once again  in less than 2 weeks  they messed up our pizza order. Once again  a manager  Spencer  offered to take care of the bill - as he said  ""it\'s the least we could do..."" Do I dare return?"
Miss Cristina O.,Pacifica  CA,115,60,15,10/26/2011,3.0,Food was good. The servers have been trained well on how to handle change of shifts.  They take a little bit longer to check on your beverage  but they are overall nice people.
Clarence A.,Daly City  CA,480,972,1900,1/7/2010,3.0,interesting I swear I wrote about this place already.. oh well  at BJ's go for the snakebites at bar if not try the sampler of beers they have on tap  food wise chicken wings always good here  chicken fried steak is sometimes good sometimes not so good  meatloaf not very good  5 friggin stars for the poozookie haha so to review chicken wings and huge cookie hahawaiters are ok when they first opened and you ordered over the phone and came to pick it up at the designated time you would have to add an extra 30min nowadays they have kinda worked that kink out at most now you wait 5 min for a phone order. Place is roomy with several tv's with majority of all the local sports teams playing if not recapping at the bar they got a huge if I remember correctly 4 or 6 tvs that are connected together to make one big screen depending on the game that is play they have one big picture or 4 or 6 several different games onthey do got a happy hour = |food *** so so chicken wangs is 4 solid stars poozookie is 5 solid starsservice *** phone orders sometimes on point sometime they lose your order  in house friendly and they try to never have your cup of water or cup of beer ever hit bottom they TRY!!!price $$ during happy hour food prices are decent regular hours though not so great but it is good food kinda hahaambiance **** super spacious  in a mall (blah)  alot of TV's always good crowds of folks hit up this place newly familys  business meetings  blue collars  biotech employees  college folks  etc usually at the bar hahaagain to drink they make decent snakebites  to eat chicken wangs  dessert poozookie!!! haha
Larry K.,San Francisco  CA,9,23,,4/30/2013,4.0,Got to admit I'm a little blown away by the quantity of bad reviews here. While the service is spotty and sometimes it's a long wait to be seated because the place is often packed (how bad can it be if it is almost always packed?)  their menu is HUGE  and I've never ate a bad meal. So it's not the greatest restaurant in the world  but I never found the place dirty as some have mentioned  and I've never gotten sick as others have mentioned. I must have ate here a dozen times  and will certainly return next time I head to the mall.
Edgar G.,San Francisco  CA,221,404,9,10/12/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I've dined at this BJ's many times for the past 7 years  but tonight was the worst experience ever. First  it took about 10 minutes for our waiter to introduce us  and by that time we were already ready to order out entree. In addition  we ordered two appetizers and he promised they would come out before our entree  but isn't that normally how it works? We waited another 15-20 minutes and for some odd reason our entrees came out before our appetizer. Our waiter also didn't notify us that he was going on break  so I informed his replacement about our appetizers. He made sure to double check on our order but it never came. We asked to cancel one but to bring out the chips and salsa since its easier to make and it would've taken another 20 minutes to make the mushroom spinach appetizer. I finished my entree before the appetizer even came out  so that frustrated me. The waiter told us it was coming and by that time I just wanted my check. I asked for the manager but he never came out. Was he that ashamed of his employees to not speak to a customer about their poor customer service? I don't know but I know he wasn't busy and was dodging my table. All I wanted to tell him was how disappointed I was with my dinner and that I've never had a bad experience prior. All in all  the manager really showed me what this BJ franchise is really about. I will never step foot in this particular BJ's again. The least the manager could have done was come over and apologize  comp our meal and wish we would come dine again.
Jolen D.,New York  NY,4,83,2,7/7/2014,1.0,I have to say I HATE THIS place sooooooooooooo much. My friend took me here  I asked him not to but  he resisted against my better judgement and boy did the verdict come back and it read  horrible food. I just hate the teenagers who are there yelling and just smickering and being annoying while you eat your food  you havea circus around you. Was one of the worst meals I have ever eat  never again!
Vivian L.,San Francisco  CA,265,246,83,8/17/2010,1.0,I came here last weekend for my cousin's birthday dinner. What a disaster.We waited around 30 minutes for a table of 7 around 9:30. We got seated and decided what we wanted. Ordered our food  and waited. For some reason  it took REALLY long for our food to come  but it did arrive  but where were our appetizers? We asked our waiter where our appetizers were  and he said another waiter took our appetizers to the wrong table so then he canceled our order. And you tell us this NOW?! Then our waiter said he can make another order for appetizers  but we told him it was fine and that we could just eat our dinner instead. So the waiter gave us our dinner  but my friends got a mini pizza instead of a medium pizza like they ordered. Our waiter then said that he heard mini instead of medium  and that he was sorry so he gave us the mini pizza on the house. That was a kind gesture  but that was two mess ups already. I got the BJ's favorite pizza  and it wasn't that bad. I DID want to try the Avocado Egg Rolls  but the silly waiter had to bring it to another table... Ergh. The waiter apologized to us plenty of times and gave us 2 birthday pizookies instead of 1. This place has got to have the worst customer service  EVER. Never again am I coming back here  unless it's for a special occasion.
crystal e.,Daly City  CA,23,135,,1/2/2010,3.0,Best time to go is during their Happy Hour M-Th: 3-7  10-close and on Sundays from 10-close. Happy hour specials include have off mini deep dish pizzas at $5 each  $2 off appetizers and $1 off draft beers. If their pints of beer were cheaper  I'd come here for happy hour more often. If you have a group  pitchers are the way to go!Best choice appetizers: Chicken wings  hot artichoke spinach dip and avocado egg rollsBest dessert: Pazookies and BJ's BrownieBest Dinner Choices: Pastas  Pizzas and Sandwiches
Miss H.,San Francisco  CA,262,324,262,4/13/2008,4.0,"This is the way to do it:Avocado eggrolls.BJ\'s favorite.Pitcher of Hef.Chocolate chunk pizookie.I did an eating & exercise log this weekend for a class assignment and I felt sick to my stomach when I realized my dinner was already 1100+ calories... and that was only pizza & beer.BUT!!!! that\'s ok because since you usually have to wait for a table  you can go ""exercise"" around the mall! Walking from store to store  carrying items  and trying on clothes is a workout."
Matt G.,San Francisco  CA,2156,1903,3745,6/24/2006,1.0,My wife found a piece of hair in her Mashed potatoes and my Meat-loaf was still icy in the inside.The Beer is ok  Beach Chalet brewery is better according to my wife. We won't come here ever  I would go to Iraq then going to BJ\rAdvisory warning\rDo not come here  if you want a good meal  eat at the food court in the Mall.
Susy C.,San Francisco  CA,704,1720,1208,12/17/2006,3.0,It's a chain. Sometimes the wait is long  sometimes it's not. Sometimes it's crowded and rowdy  sometimes it's still calm enough to hear your own thoughts. Food is decent  the prices are okay for the quality you get.It gets the job done when i'm shopping and starving @ Tanforan so what the hey.All in all  this is one of those mediocre places when you've really got nowhere else to go and can't make up your mind when you're nearby so you come here.outdoor patio with heat lamps is awesome after you've knocked a few back... or if you're in the middle of a heat wave.
Olma M.,South San Francisco  CA,296,395,704,11/15/2006,3.0,The multimedia side of me can really like this place - I like knowing that  at any given time  I can take a quick peek around and find the latest sports score. I found the atmosphere and food to be quite pleasing  too (not the place to go if you're especially particular about eating 'healthy ' but they do offer a veggie burger).So  if I'm at a brewery  I'm pretty much gonna have something deep fried. We started off with the onion strings  despite my table mates' advice against it. They'd experienced a soggy order twice before  but this one was just right and crispy. As if that weren't enough fried food  I just had to have my Fish n' Chips w/malt vinegar. It hit the spot  but the fish tasted a bit too 'processed' for my liking. If this were based on this sole dish and specific outing  I'd probably give it two stars; However  based on two other visits to this location  and experiencing other dishes myself and through other's taste buds  I'm bumping it up to the average 3 stars. I've been told that once I try the dessert  I may bump it up to 4 stars... Looking forward to that day.
Josie W.,San Francisco  CA,14,122,79,9/23/2010,4.0,I love the chain restaurant BJ's. Last time the server was horrible!! The food was delicious though. Very good. Decor  atmosphere was nice. Since we were there for happy hour and we were just chatting and having a blast  we didn't really notice the horrible service. However  upon evaluation again on the service  it was bad. So 4 stars for the initial experience there  but that could have been because of the good company of my friends. We had to flag the waiter or even other waiters down for any type of service. He seemed distracted and non-alert to our actual table. The food: The pizzas were deceivingly small yet very filling. The Apple Crisp had to be shared. It was too big for me  but very yummy.
Shadi K.,San Francisco  CA,7,66,,7/29/2014,3.0,I would give 3 stars for the food  something is missing about the taste not sure what it is but would give 4 stars for the desert  which made me leave the place happy !
Scott J.,San Luis Obispo  CA,5,39,,2/2/2013,3.0,Overpriced and overloud but delicious nonetheless. The beers are definitely worth a try. Wait staff were highly efficient though changed 3 times in the course of the meal.
Larry B.,South San Francisco  CA,27,170,113,8/2/2012,2.0,"This place always sucks for service. I am liking the food  it\'s close to home  but again  the service was the worst ever this time! We sat ""outside"" in the Mall area  and i think they forgot about us! I\'ve been here before  and it wasn\'t bad  but still not great  they always seem understaffed and overstuffed with clientele. The happy hour is ok  and they have a late night happy hour as well  but it\'s not the greatest deal if you\'re hungry. Try the in house root beer on tab  it\'s bottomless as well  and pretty tasty. Enjoy  and good luck finding parking! : - |"
Lance O.,Castro  San Francisco  CA,0,4,3,1/31/2013,3.0,"This is probably the 3rd time I\'ve ever ate at BJ\'s and the stars are due to the first 2 times I\'ve never had a problem. However this time around was ridiculous and not what I expect from a pretty known restaurant. I went with a group of people for a birthday and it all started when they tried seating us at a booth that didn\'t have enough seating for the whole group. Not only did the time we finally sat down  take our order and receive our food last nearly an hour  they lost someone\'s order. A burger to be exact which he wanted well done. Apologies were given and they said ""the burger was overcooked"" and they\'ll bring another  stat. When it did arrive  boom. Medium rare. Really  I don\'t ever remember food ever being wrong  or burnt like my friends bruschetta  or a pizookie taking 20 minutes to make. Sorry to say but it was less than amusing."
Alfonso D.,South San Francisco  CA,2,21,2,9/14/2012,2.0,pretty good beer for all tastes and i love the avocado rolls. The entrees have never really impressed me though. Sometimes simple is better and I feel like they over do it with the presentations and not enough attention to the flavor.
Jeanine J.,San Francisco  CA,9,10,,3/14/2011,2.0,Expensive: $25 for a sandwich and salad.Turkey sandwich and Ceasar salad were fine but defintely no wow factor.Service is weird: overly friendly staff and what seems like tons of people working there. Everyone is working the upsell to the point of overkill. I ordered take-out and even though there were three people at the take-out counter (seperate from the hostess stand) I had to check-in on on my order a half hour after I placed it because no one bothered to let me know it was ready. Seems like a case of a good chain gone bad - too many people with specific siloed jobs and not enough cohesion or love put into the food to make it a memorable experience. I blame the management at this particular location  and while I won't return to San Bruno  I may give another location another shot.
Stacey D.,Mesa  AZ,352,206,86,3/1/2012,2.0,Hey bartender...my AZ ID is not fake...and I can hear you as you stand in front of me questioning if you should get a manager or if passports are easy to fake. What a horrible way to start my dining experience. Ever hear of whispering or going somewhere else to have your incompetent discussion? Tact is not everyone's strong suit. Food was just ok - lettuce wraps are decent. I asked for more peanut sauce  but it never came. I sat that the bar since it was just myself  but think I would have got better service in the dining area. Not going back any time soon...
Barbara M. M.,San Francisco  CA,1,109,5,8/23/2012,2.0,Meh. This place totally lacks the food presentation and the quality is just ok. My Thai salad was surprisingly very small ( although the plate where it's served is huge optical illusion ). The small 5 pieces of chicken in it where dried  very cold and chewy...not good. The dressing was lacking too and so the rest of the ingredients. My daughter Mac and cheese came in a huge big portion but the presentation was not appealing. You could tell that they didn't put any effort in mixing the Kraft cheese powdered with the macaroni. There were chunks of pasta attached together. Overall the kids menu' was a good value for money. The service here is great  too bad that the food presentation/ quality is lacking.
Sarina I.,San Francisco  CA,111,202,23,5/27/2010,2.0,"I\'m very picky when it comes to yelping stuff. I usually try not to yelp places that so many people have yelped and also chain places that are really hard to yelp.Last night  me and a couple of friends headed to BJ\'s for some apps and drinks. Here\'s my experience:First off if I come up to the hostess/host table  it\'s because my party NEEDS a table  not because I\'m admiring how it looks. Lady needed to get a clue  since she asked ""What I needed?"" mmm anyways.We were seated and given our menus. We ordered: Potato Skins  Calamari and the Mediterranean Pizza. I\'d pass on the calamari unless you enjoy LOTS and LOTS of PEPPER.Potato Skins were alright and the Pizza was tasty. Service pretty much sucked. We had to ask for small plates a couple times. Our drinks were alright as well. The strawberry mojito tasted the best  I would get that again.Overall  this is a place I hardly ever eat at  unless someone is paying (which is why I went last night ;) but since I\'m closer to the city  I\'d def find another place to grab a bite to eat for cheaper price."
Karlicorn U.,San Mateo  CA,2,198,1,11/3/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"I gave them another chance thinking there\'s no way they are still as horrendous and redick as the last time  but I WAS WRONG! It started with the rude girl on the phone when I tried to call ahead  which BJ\'s encourages you to do mind you...She made me wait for 3 minutes on hold just to give my name! We get there ten minuets later and are told it\'s a ten  minute wait  which would had been fine had that been the truth. The truth was it was a 25 minute wait and we only went there because we had a movie to go to and we had just over one hour by the time the ten minute waiting time lie was told to us. Just as I was about to go set the stupid buzzer device on the counter and leave  it buzzed. Was a total mistake to stay! My sons dad had to seriously go searching for silverware and napkins! Seriously! He was actually told by a server that they ""were out""!!!! WTF!?!?! We finally get some that were so hot we had to let them cool for five minutes just so we could eat our side salads. They got my sons order wrong which was a super simple order too. Brought our drinks about 25 minutes after we had been seated and AFTER we were done with our salads and all we ordered was iced tea  oj  and a beer. OMG! Was like we were being filmed on a hidden camera show to test our patience. Just kept reiterating how this location does not deserve another chance. I have been to 6 other Bay Area BJ\'s and not one other one except the Tanforan location is god awful. I would rather drive to Santa Clara than go to Tanforan\'s ever again!"
Sami R.,San Francisco  CA,8,170,,9/14/2010,3.0,This place is okay  and an odd choice for our 100th review (woot!). The franchise is about on par with Applebee's (or a slight  slight cut above depending on who you ask)  although this will depend on what you order as our experience relates.We ordered two pasta dishes  one was good with a hint of spice. A little different than what one would expect from spaghetti  but quite good all the same. The other dish  a cheese pasta  was very bland though. Not a lot of flavor  and something that we wouldn't recommend to anyone.All in all  this chain is okay  and this location is a decent one to try. We might hit up another place in the chain at some point  but won't be craving to do so.
Janelle C.,Livermore  CA,101,48,61,6/11/2010,3.0,I get to visit for lunch every so often and I come back because it's clean  the service is OK and I know what I'm going to get (foodwise). French dip and Tuscan tomato bisque are my favorites. The crispy thin fries are usually a hit  but my last visit was a bit of a downer (not so crispy).If you're going to visit  be prepared to wait during lunch and dinner hours. If you're trying to get a quick bite  I'd recommend bar seating or takeout (you can order online).
Melody T.,Santa Monica  CA,175,736,135,9/5/2009,4.0,I'm a big fan of this place. Went there all the time in SD during college and was stoked to see when it first started popping up in the bay area. Can never go wrong with the bbq chicken pizza or that balsamic chicken w/mashed potatoes...and pizookie for dessert of course. Also love that they have wild berry cider - perfect bar drink with some happy hour pizzas.
Coco J.,Pismo Beach  CA,136,440,2069,4/9/2012,3.0,Tilapia was a-okay! healthy and delicious. this location was super crowded  call ahead to get your name on the list!
Hideo M.,San Jose  CA,83,109,56,5/31/2012,1.0,The food quite bad and I'm pretty happy that my customer didn't show up to my lunch meeting. Had lunch portion Salmon with vegetables. Salmon was overcooked but thank goodness not as bad as the veggies  or should I say Squash. The squash was overcooked so badly  I felt like I was eating baby food  Mush... Next time  I'm only having beer...
Arnold W.,Irvine  CA,697,1574,987,3/10/2010,3.0,Great location...right next to SFO. Perfect for my 2.5 hour layover to Boston. Teresa N. picked me up and we met up with Hana C. Awesome for friends who live near airports. =) Food here is your normal BJ's like everywhere else. Service was a bit slow  even though it was late at night.
Kris L.,San Francisco  CA,194,805,261,3/27/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,A and I dropped in for a bite to eat while we were waiting for our movie to start (Green Zone  if you're interested). We were there around 11am and here were only a couple of tables occupied. We were seated immediately and our waiter came by super speedy-like to take our orders.We split one of the flatbread pizzas for an appetizer - the chicken pesto one  I believe. It was good  but maybe because I love me some pesto! For my main course  I got the California Chicken Sandwich. Toasted sourdough bread  avocados  chicken  pickles  a little bit of a spicy kick from the mayo...it was really good. I'd definitely order it again. Oh  and don't forget to order the strawberry lemonade. It's really tasty.The location is super convenient because it's in the mall and a good place to eat before or after you watch a movie at the theater.
Rhia R.,South San Francisco  CA,255,600,483,4/19/2010,4.0,It's often a hit or miss when it comes to the wait  but the food is pretty consistent. After enjoying a beautiful day in SF  a small group of us headed here and arrived just in time for happy hour. We helped ourselves to one of the empty tables (gasp) and were immediately greeted by our server. A few rounds of beer with Piranha nachos and chicken wings totally hit the spot. The nice weather allowed for some of the customers to use their outdoor patio  which is ideal if you want to engage in conversation without the inside noise. If I had room leftover for dessert  I would have loved to get a pizookie.
Ron M.,Burlingame  CA,78,17,40,6/27/2011,2.0,"So today we had the worst service that we\'ve ever had in any restaurant. 1st and for most  Our waitress did not smile once when she greeted our table. I thought ""what ever  let it go"". 2nd her opening line was a couple of questions  that she didn\'t let us even answer  and an offer of an item then another question that she really cared less to hear the answer of once again. 3rd she never asked how our appetizer was. All in all we had the worst service from a waitress named Mariana. She didn\'t care we that we were there. She was an order taker. I don\'t normally tip bad but she earned her lack of a tip she received. Hopefully  for her sake  financially  she was just having a bad day. Being in the trade  being welcoming and personable pays off. The service here really needs to step up there game."
Kevin L.,San Francisco  CA,79,15,3,7/16/2009,3.0,I'll keep this short and simple! The GOOD-Cool place for friends to hang out.-It's a brewery-Ample parking-Open reasonably lateThe Bad-The wait time to get a table is pretty hefty most of the times but that isn't the fault of the restaurant... its the flow of people.-The food seems to be overly salty. I find that I have to drink gallons of water when I get home.The Ugly-Service most of the time is terrible. It took us 20 minutes to order food and seemed to be skipped by waiters quite often.All in all  it's an okay time but I think the company you are with makes up for it. Also  ask to be served by KIM  she's the best and made all the other times that we went worth it. How often do we have personality with our waiters and waitresses? She'll sit with you and joke around with ya. She was so good  we tipped her 30%.
Whitney F.,Fort Collins  CO,5,5,,9/18/2011,3.0,Food was okay  nothing spectacular. Prices are pretty average. The beers are pretty boring - not necessarily bad  but nothing to write home about. I probably wouldn't come back. I think I've been spoiled by much better beers.
Gabe R.,South San Francisco  CA,7,110,,9/9/2009,4.0,REAL strawberry lemonade? Refillable? YES PLEASE!BJ's is such a nice resto-bar. Totally blows Dave & Busters out of the water (frankly  D&B does it overly with the games)the food from BJ's is pretty awesome. I mean  their pastas are always a sure thing for me. But i also LOVE their french dip. mmmhmmm. I tried this one thing  wild rice pilaf with prawns. it was spicy  but soo good. The lemonade with it was a sure win for me.But aside from the food and the (i cant emphasize this enough) amazing strawberry lemonade  I find myself watching the games in their multitude of TVs. This totally lives up to the resto-bar thing its getting at. BJs is always no-fail dinner for me.now to try their famous pizzookie...
Melinda J.,South San Francisco  CA,0,21,1,1/12/2013,4.0,This is my go-to restaurant every time someone comes to visit. It is consistently tasty and the service is good. It is best to call ahead and get put on the waiting list though because the wait time here seems to always be about an hour. My husband loves the Black & Blue burger as well as the burger pizza.I love the wedge salad and the jalapeno burger.
Sandra S.,San Pablo  CA,206,506,145,3/15/2010,3.0,I've actually never been a fan of BJ's. My sister was begging me to go and I figured I've avoided eating there long enough and should go with her.My last adventure to BJs many many months ago was not pleasant so I vowed never to go back.Only because I wanted to make my sister happy did I go.I was actually very pleased during my visit :)Since it as beautiful outside we decided to sit outside and eat. Our service was excellent as sometimes I fear when you eat outside they forget about you. They didn't :)I ordered 2 small mini meals that was new. The hawaiian shrimp skewers and the Mozzerella and Tomato salad. It was excellent!! Nicely seasoned. A great portion. I was definitely very satisfied :)And so was my sister :)
Amy B.,Long Beach  CA,279,251,77,9/17/2009,4.0,Good beers and a good happy hour. Can't ask for much more! I really like the sliders and the wings aren't bad. My boyfriend prefers the bbq chicken pizza. On the other hand  I really don't like the pot stickers. Which I mean to say  I don't really like the sauce. it's so salty and I really like salty foods so beware! But hey  half off at happy hour leaves me with not much to complain about  right? I prefer the blonde and the nutty brunette for the beers but they are all very good! They will let you try a little if you want to try before you buy which I suggest you do! The bar area is self-seating so no need to wait for a table and the big screen TV's are always showing a game if you're a sports fan!
C K.,Alameda  CA,1,10,,3/15/2013,1.0,"This place used to be ok. Maybe better than that. But we went by for a quick meal on March 11th about 4:00 PM and the place was a mess.We were served in the bar (the greeter said there were no tables for three but we could see them empty) . Our waiter seemed to be the only one there and was running ragged. It also seemed to be end of shift . The manager should know better than to run a place like that.We ordered simple food. Chili for my wife and pizza for me. How could it be easier. Just get chili from a pot.I got my pizza after a while and luckily shared with my wife. Three quarters of an hour and several ""I am sorry"" stories from William M  we cancelled the pizza. No explanation. No nothing.Drinks were late too.I am not sure what was going on but do not go there execpt if you want to drink. And sit at the bar where you can grab the bartender. Food service was impossible. They need waiters and cooks--this is a big place.And then there were the bathrooms. They needed to issue wading boots to get to the urinals. The dirty paper towels were piled about a three feet high near the sink. And my wife said the womens was a mess too.So I do not know what happened to my old standby for quick food. But I gotta kiss you off after this. And I cannot put zero stars--I tried."
Neece S.,Long Beach  CA,77,36,3,5/7/2012,2.0,I don't know  the menu wasn't very appetizing to me. We went here for my aunt's birthday. Just a few of us girls wanting to go out and get a few drinks. This was my first time here  wasn't impressed. Not somewhere I'd go again  especially not for the food.
Jorlyn W.,Daly City  CA,200,51,12,1/8/2014,2.0,This place is decent. Over priced food  medium sized portions. Called in to put our name down and they told us 20 minutes got there in 10 and if was an extra 30 to see down. Besides that we got seated at a huge boot it was a bit awkward but it's ok. We ordered the shrimp scampi? BBQ chicken salad  and I must say the salad was really good and the scampi I would definitely pass on that.. Strawberry lemonade that my gf ordered was a bit too sweet so I wouldn't recommend ordering it. Service was a bit difficult  our server said they were understaffed  I appreciate the honesty but it sure didn't look like they were under staffed lol  they had people talking and walking around laughing. Anyways the bill came out it was almost 50$ for 2 drinks and 2 entrees.... Wasn't really worth the amount of $ we spent. I'm sure we'll be back to give it another shot. The pazookie is definitely something to get I just didn't get it this time
Jenny L.,Millbrae  CA,154,941,671,2/11/2008,2.0,The BJ's in Foster City gets at least 3 stars for a solid sports bar  grill  and pizza joint. However  the food and service at this chain can't compete. My chardonnay shrimp pasta was diluted with water whereas my friend's cajun pasta was cooked too al dente. Anything fried glistened in the light  which meant it was refried and had excess oil. The only redeeming quality was ending the evening on a sweet note with the baked apple crisp.Parking is ample in this mall  but the long wait for average service suggests that you can find better alternatives. Some of the waiters are sweet by offering a free birthday dessert. However  the dining experience didn't quite pass my standards.
Dominique S.,San Francisco  CA,57,13,,1/16/2012,1.0,"Can I say that this is actually a .5 of a star? This place is worthy of my first review for it\'s incredibly rude service. After taking my son to hop and play  my hungry two year old  my disabled husband and two month old were excited to try out BJs. We never go out considering how hard it is as a nursing mother and also with my husbands disability it makes things extremely difficult. They told my husband a table would be ready in 45 minutes and not more than that. After waiting for 47 minutes  we went in to check the status of our table. The girl told us it would be another 20+ minutes. At this point my son was fussing and my daughter was asleep. I asked her ""why did you guys say it was going to be less than 45 min? Now it\'s turned into an hour plus"". She snippily replied ""running time right now is 47 minutes"". I asked her how long take out would be and she said 15 minutes. My son was in his stroller crying while we looked at the take out menu  and while the two hostess talked crap about us right in front of us about how we changed our mind. This pissed me off because I could hear them and the other hostess looked at my son rolling her eyes. She came by with some crayons and paper and gave it to him and said ""your welcome"" what a rude girl! My husband grabbed the crayons and put them on the table because of her rudeness. While we waited for our take out  they persisted with giving me bad looks and starring at my son. We walked and waited outside because of how uncomfortable they made us feel and my husband walked passed the door and heard the hosting bragging to the cashier at the take out corner how she rudely gave the crayons to us to shut my son up. My husband never complains. At this point he walked in and she turned and said ""is there anything I can help you with?"" sweetly. He told her ""no I didn\'t ask you to give us crayons and I didn\'t appreciate that. And I don\'t appreciate you chit chatting to your friend about us either.""Just as he said that  the manager walked into the conversation. We walked outside and the manager apologized. He was nice but didn\'t offer any type of compensation for their rude behavior and our incredibly long wait. It really isn\'t even about the long wait. It\'s really about how these girls continued to talk crap about us while we were there. Yeah it\'s loud in there  but I could clearly hear them. It really ruined my night. It was pretty over priced. I payed 42 bucks for a large bj favorite deep dish pizza and sliders. Then the icing on the cake! My son and I were the only one who ate the sliders...and we got very sick! Like sick to where my two year old was doing projectile vomiting and diarrhea. I was doing the same for 2 days. We were flying out to Hawaii 2 days later and it was the most miserable experience to watch your two year old in pain and you yourself is puking. My husband can only help so much due to his condition. Maybe they did something to my food because I was really pissed? No idea  better to be safe than sorry. NEVER EVER AGAIN!"
Nancy C.,San Francisco  CA,202,220,71,1/8/2012,3.0,"Do try hard to conceal your girlish giggle (I\'m pointing at you  guys) when your server says ""Hello. Welcome to BJ\'s. My name is ______ and I\'m here to service you."" Yeah  I have immature friends. Men: can\'t live with \'em  can\'t send them off on a rocket to Mars. Moving on...What can I say about BJ\'s that hasn\'t already already been stated? The food is decent for mall fare. There\'s nothing outstanding on their menu but it gets the job done if you\'re hungry and you don\'t feel like getting something from the food court. It\'s good for groups if you want to sit for a while and catch up over food.The wait is always super long on Fridays and weekends so you might want to make a reservation if you know you want to eat here with a big group. I\'ve been here many times and nothing has ever stood out enough to me for me to order it again on future visits. I will say that their salads are disappointing though. Stay away from them. The desserts are pretty good but it all sits on the cusp of overly sweet considering how their menu caters to the average American  so too much sugar is pretty much a given. The same applies for most of their food: too much fat  too much grease  too much salt  etc. When you come here  come for convenience and the social aspect. If you\'re here for the food  just expect average American fare along the lines of Elephant Bar and Cheesecake Factory."
Elsa C.,San Francisco  CA,20,24,11,7/24/2012,1.0,"Probably the WORST customer service I had experienced ever...I had waited a while to write this review so it would give me time to cool off and put things in perspective. My friends and I came in to watch the last game of the NBA finals because I remembered while eating here how many big screens they had everywhere  and the boys needed to watch their basketball. So  I arrive and the place is already packed but with less than 10 ppl in the waiting area. I walk over to the hostess podium and wait patiently for the golden haired hostess who is finishing up something on the computer to ask to put my name down. I wait  and wait...and she doesn\'t acknowledge me so I think I better get her attention by saying ""excuse me?"" and she kind of holds her finger up at me and gives me a fake smile and says that she will be with me in a minute with a slight edge in her voice. That\'s fine  you\'re busy  I work at a restaurant...I get it.BUT then on the other side of the large podium a line starts forming and another hostess appears  and proceeds to take care of that line. She takes the name of one party  and then another  and the golden haired waitress pays no mind to anything that\'s going on. Seeing that two parties already had cut me in the line to put my name down  I ask the first hostess - ""umm  should I be asking HER to put my name down since you\'re busy?"" And..the golden haired hostess totally ignores me!I\'m pretty annoyed at this point  but I walk over to the other hostess  a dark haired girl  and I tell her I tried to out my name down with golden hair earlier but she blew me off. The dark haired hostess apologizes and gives me a pager  and takes my party of 7 down and tells me it\'s going to be about half an hour. I wait patiently again for my pager to go off. 45 minutes later  I go back up to the podium and ask what the deal is  and a third  african american hostess takes my pager and goes ""hmmm...i don\'t seem to have your reservation in our system."" REALLY? After all that you lose my freaking name? How else did I get a pager if you didn\'t take my name down? Not her fault  i know  but I glare back at the first two hostesses I encountered. The third hostess apologizes and tells me she will see what she can do. She is probably the only capable hostess out of the whole lot since the others were either rude or incompetent to not even take my name down when I already stated how bad I was treated.I arrived at 5:45 to put my name down. When we got seated...guess what time it was? 8 freaking thirty...almost 3 hours because those hostesses were so incapable of doing their jobs. It was just plain ridiculous. I would have left if the guys weren\'t so adamant about not missing the game. I am writing this to management of this establishment because I want them to know how poorly I was treated and how incompetent their hostess staff were. I never even got an apology from the first two  it was only the third hostess that looked really sorry and tried to help. Also  when we finally sat down my friend sat down to a plate with leftover food on it. When he asked for another  the waitress gave him a replacement with an equal amount of leftover food  not once  but twice! Gross. I will never EVER be coming back to this BJ\'s location again. Such a shame because I love their pizza and pizookies. I hope management cracks down and makes sure nothing like this happens to anyone ever again because I will say it again HANDS DOWN WORST HOSTESSES and CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER."
linda w.,Redwood City  CA,20,29,,5/6/2014,5.0,Was here for the 7th game of warrior vs clipper. The five stars are for the bar staff  Brandon  Sam and Trish. As busy as it was  they still manage to satisfied all my every demands. BJ you are lucky to have them  self motivator and professional.
Dan L.,San Francisco  CA,68,64,,9/4/2012,2.0,Have been to this restaurant several times before. We went this Tuesday evening - and hoped there wouldn't be a crowd. There wasn't but took about 10 minutes to get seated. I enjoyed their light lager beer - but food was hit and miss - daughter's pasta was bland - angel hair barely had any flavor (where were the sun dried tomatos and garlic). My thai mango salad was tasty but the portions were small. Plus service was real  real slow - about 1/2 hour wait plus 1/2 wait for the desert. Tons of people working there but they need to get their act together and get some quality in the kitchen.
Max D.,San Jose  CA,24,20,7,9/4/2012,1.0,Worst BJS by far. I don't mind slow service if I get good or DECENT food. I ordered a rare New York strip and it came out medium to well done. They redid the steak and it came out rare  happy right? Wrong! The steak was cold and had terrible sear  for $20 I expect a decent steak Jesus. I tried to call on one of the waitresses but she literally looked at me then walked a way. Long story short  no tip and last time I'll ever be back. Other BJs are MUCH better.
Jason W.,San Francisco  CA,473,129,15,4/23/2012,3.0,"food is actually really good here. i can\'t complain much about it. the deep dish pizzas are delicious  all the chicken dishes that i\'ve gotten (chicken limone  chcken parmigiana  lemon crusted chicken) were all extremely good. obviously to top off the night  you finish off with ""to die for"" pazookies  coming in assorted flavors such as oreo  white chocolate macademia  triple chocolate  original?  and their new red velvet flavor!!!the only thing that is wrong is their service. it\'s quite lackluster. they don\'t come to your table often and i\'ve had to get up several times on numerous occasions to get my server and bring him to our table to either get our orders  get the bill  ask for more of whatever  etc. it gets frustrating when the customer has to get up for them. other servers that are not assigned to your table are pretty rude if you ask them to get your designated server (at lesat from my experiences of remembrance). still food is pretty delish  though i truly wish they would get some bigger items for the larger eaters such as myself."
Theresa D.,Daly City  CA,31,418,53,1/30/2010,3.0,A good place to have a beer and catch up with old friends who like to be in loud and boisterous places. Nothing fancy  its basically a big sports bar with food that you would expect at a place like this. Burgers  Pasta  Pizza  and some salads as well. But the major part of the menu is their drink selection. Good for small groups.
Shine S.,San Francisco  CA,160,177,49,3/12/2010,3.0,Nice ambiance for a chain! The food seems like any other average restaurant but a notch higher. I ordered pulled pork sandwich  it wasn't bad but I was disappointed in the hamburger. Maybe next time I should order the steak *shrug*The dessert was great  a fresh cookie and ice cream. I don't like sweets really but it was really good!
Jenn V.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,,6/4/2014,4.0,Went there on a weekday about 2pm for a late lunch. Service was good and we enjoyed our food. I thought it was on the pricier side but not expensive.
John P.,Millbrae  CA,0,2,,2/19/2013,3.0,Service was horrendous. My group of more than 20 had a reservation and suddenly  at the night of our dinner  our reservation was gone-- perhaps because we all looked young and they did really not cater our needs.Service was rude  food took WAY TOO LONG  and the only good thing was the pizooki.
Chas A.,Sunnyvale  CA,116,173,137,9/25/2011,2.0,A bit disappointed with this BJs location. Service was awful- we waited 15 minutes to order; it took more than 20 minutes for us to get our food; the waitress did not check up on us while we ate; the food was a bit cold (I could tell that it was sitting out for awhile before we got it); when we asked for a box to wrap our food we weren't given a bag; and they did not clear our plates while we had dessert (so our little table for two was filled with three dirty dishes and we ate our dessert over those dishes). The only positive thing about this place was that they seated us pretty quick after saying we'd have to wait 45 min. to an hour. I definitely will not be returning to this location again.
Claudia M.,Fort Shafter  HI,159,315,200,12/18/2011,3.0,Ok food  i had to wait awhile to get a refill on my drink....meh of a place
Joyce W.,South San Francisco  CA,4,26,356,4/12/2010,4.0,Love their Happy Hour menu! Awesome! Frozen Margarita (original/ Pomegranate) are always my favorite!Love to go there for lunch~~~ great size & price for half soup half salad  pasta or sandwish!!! Love their Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. Everything in that is just taste so good!!!!! But I always wish to have more tortilla chip~~~~ =PLove their PIZZA with thick bread!!! Love their special HONEY-CRISP CHICKEN SALAD which is with honey mustard dressing!!! AWESOME*But........ Just always HATE to wait there for half or an hour!!!!!
Tatiana S.,San Bruno  CA,51,11,,8/18/2010,4.0,A definite fave. Dinner time can get pretty crowded  so call ahead if you can  but seldom have a problem getting in for lunch. The lunch specials start at around $5.99 and are great. The beers are awesome and they have a full bar with excellent cocktails (try the top shelf margarita!). Great place to watch the games on mulitple tvs or sit outside on their nice patio  well protected from wind and with heaters. Good kids menu - my son LOVES BJ's!Favorite menu items - Grilled Shrimp Tacos  Buffalo Wings  Thai Salmon  Thin fries and don't even get me started on the chocolate pazookie! (Tip: There's a kids one that 's a little smaller but still great for only around $2!
Peter C.,San Bruno  CA,63,134,19,2/11/2013,2.0,Haven't been back since my to go order was screwed up  complained via snail mail with no reply.
Tatiana D.,Daly City  CA,361,356,69,5/31/2011,1.0,Named appropriately so because it sucks. Service is bad and surly. The last time I was here  my poor little two year old niece yakked on the way to the bathroom with her mom (my sister Alexis D.). The wait staff didn't even offer to help clean up or provide napkins. Food is mediocre which shouldn't be too much of a surprise since it's crappy bar fare anyway. The only thing saving this place is the Pizookie which wasn't even that good the last time I had it  too doughy for my taste.
Karim R.,San Francisco  CA,75,215,1,5/18/2009,4.0,I came to BJ's for my pre race meal with GG Saturday night . It was a great vibe in the spot and our bartender was GREAT! Shout out to Ruben who makes a mean Long Beach! Ruben took really good care of me and GG drinks appetizers he handle the meal and still made drinks for others on the side. We had the chicken wings and the spinach dip for appetitizers and they were so good. I love crispy and spicy chicken wings and the dipping sauce yum! The Spinach Artichoke dip was good too but I think I like the colorful chip better! Me and GG ordered two sandwiches she had the turkey burger that looked very good with potatoe wedges and I had the grilled california chicken sandwich. This is a good sandwich but you need the avacado to make it complete! I know because I took off the avacado on one half of the sandwich. Overall I can't wait to go back and get drunk at the bar ! haha just kidding!
Diego A.,San Francisco  CA,86,66,27,7/17/2011,4.0,BJ's is one of my favorites. It always delivers what I am expecting and brings good times to both my girlfriend and I everytime we go. It is nothing authentic but if you are looking for a reasonably priced  delicious dinner  out with friends or a loved one at a nice restaurant  BJ's is a great choice. I recommend ordering a blonde ale and some lettuce wraps to start  from their go ahead and make a delicious choice and enjoy the night. A great place for a restaurant dinner out!
Janet S.,Fresno  CA,143,1015,84,1/8/2010,3.0,All right for a chain restaurant. Ordered a chopped salad which was good; hubby had a burger melt. He really wanted a patty melt  but BJs didn't have any rye bread. So shouldn't a burger melt just be a burger? I'm just sayin' . . .
Braden K.,Honolulu  HI,517,390,3,7/14/2011,3.0,in my dirty opinion  the only BJ's that get 5/5 stars are1. my favorite adult actress in my favorite adult film.and2. my ex-girlfriend during that threesome on the beach with our friend jack daniels.just keeeding!on a more serious and appropriate note  I've heard nothing but hype hype hype about these famous BJ's spots.. I finally came through with some co-workers after handling some business and we all ordered different dishes.SERVICE:it was great up until about mid-meal when our waiter courteously handed off to another waitress who was friendly and perky though slow like yurtle the turtle..ATMOSPHERE:sports bar theme. decent lighting  comfortable seats  several plasma televisions with all different sporting events going on simultaneously. my kind of place! too bad we were on the clock  otherwise i'd have ordered a few rounds!FOOD:I hate to sound like a snob and it really does take a lot for me to complain.. but for $12  I had expected a rather filling portion. the roast dip sandwich was tiny. a $5-footlong is twice as filling and tastes a lot fresher. the horseradish was the imitated substitute  diluted and not spicy at all. the worst part was the fries. they were soggy  thin like mosquito legs  not filling  soaked in grease  and obviously microwaved.the jambalaya was much tastier. spicy and tangy in flavor  each bite included pieces of sausage  shrimp  and vegetables. it resembled the way I like my women  generously coated in thick  cajun seasoning! just kidding  i'm done.my other co-workers ordered soup  salad  and sandwich combos and fish tacos. speaking of which  I never really understood the 'wedge salad' ordeal? whatever  I wasn't eating it haha i'll keep it short and end on a good note. the PIZOOKIE saved BJ's life. this little baked cookie with two heaping piles of ice cream on top tasted like it was made from the breast milk of an angel. the combination of a freshly baked  half oreo  half chocolate-chip cookie base with two large lumps of french vanilla ice cream sitting on top was the crme de la crme!i don't even eat sweets. no candy  no soda  no cookies  brownies  etc. but that dessert was the BEES KNEES.
Steph L.,Daly City  CA,71,179,134,1/6/2010,2.0,It seems that everyone i know loves it here  but I could live without it. The last time I went my friend and I sampled about four different beers(all in fairly large glasses) which was pretty cool and reasonably priced. To me the food is just ok and they do not have a large enough selection of deserts. When i played softball in college my teammates and I used to order those big cookie things  and i must admit those are pretty good when you have a big appetite. The pizzas are ok  but I dont really like anything else on the menu. I'm never terribly excited to go there.
Sharon G.,San Francisco  CA,324,254,132,7/5/2011,3.0,This isnt a place I'd go to often since I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants. The wait on a Sunday night was decent - about a half hour. We got the great white  BJs favorite  BBQ chicken and spinach and artichoke. My favorites were the Great White and BBQ Chicken! ALSO  YOU CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT HAVING A PIZOOKIE! The cookies n' cream pizookie was fantab! We also had the red velvet one - which tasted fruitier than I would've liked. That one was meh. I could pass. Overall  decent!
Rich P.,Antioch  CA,68,653,133,5/11/2012,4.0,Outside patio is super nice on a sunny afternoon. Try the Great White  or the Buffalo Chicken pizza. I also really liked their new beer - hop-something-or-other. At any rate  it's really good. give it a shot. I also tried the watermelon and feta salad. Grubbin!
Anne E.,San Francisco  CA,259,251,117,4/24/2009,3.0,Every time I come here  I always order their Avocado Egg Rolls. I can just have that as my entree and I'd be happy. The avocado filling with cream cheese and spices is so delicious. I guess there's something about the crunchy outside and the creamy inside that gets me. Yummm...my pregnant ass is craving it right about now. Other than that  everything else is just mediocre. It's BJ's. Can't expect 5-star quality. I'd put it in the same category as Fridays  Chilis and Elephant Bar. Although  I find that BJ's has tastier food than Fridays and Elephant Bar. This particular location is always busy....expect a wait during happy hours and weekends. Note: You can reserve your table in advance. Call the restaurant!
Tammy B.,Pacifica  CA,24,76,4,7/8/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Update;Now that restaurants have to list the nutritional information I have found out my fav Santa Fe Salad has over a whopping 900 calaries  so now I've switched to their grilled shrimp lettuce wraps and a small bowl of chile or a wedge salad for under 600. A much better choice.
phewoner T.,San Francisco  CA,102,16,32,11/7/2011,1.0,first time here and this place bites! I ordered my food and BULLSHIT Waitress looks at me crazy like I stole something from her..it ain't my fault you u got problems..DUMBASS! NO TIP FOR YOU!! and to top it all off the walkway near the back was slippery as a mutha  I noticed everytime someone walked on it they nearly slipped and feel..not a good look..NEVER GOING BACK and NEVER GONNA RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!
Mr P.,San Francisco  CA,11,53,10,5/2/2012,3.0,Went to BJ's in San Bruno last night for the first time. We ordered a Roast Beef Dip and the Mahi Tuna shown above  along with a couple beers which were wonderful. My dip was good  but sadly the cook had burned the Mahi until the corners were black. It was tough  not juicy and lost all its flavor. It was very busy so it was difficult to track down our waitress  but we did and she ordered up a second round of the Mahi cooked properly. It took an additional 15 minutes to get the second plate of Mahi  but it was cooked perfectly. It was excellent. Even though the waitress did an excellent job serving us  I was dissapointed there was no discounmeal for the poorly cooked Mahi the fist time  not even 10%. Dinner overall was good though  but I might hesitate going back.
S. M.,San Francisco  CA,83,231,,4/26/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Too many kids (aka servers) standing around flirting with each other or picking their noses. Not attentive at all  food is so standard that I won't be coming back anymore plus they always mess up my order anyways (How hard is it to remember dressing on the side?)
Nicole H.,San Bruno  CA,34,3,5,9/4/2012,1.0,We called in for a reservation and they asked for our name and when we got there they didn't even put the name down on the list. It makes me sad that the customer service is awful. I gave them many chances because I love the food but sadly the waiters and waitresses are disappointing. Most of the times ive been here the waiters/waitresses take to long. They rarely check to see how were doing and when i need something they are never around and take so much time just to get a bottle of ketchup!!!!!!!!!!!!! Big disappointment.
Analyst C.,San Mateo  CA,9,233,450,2/15/2013,3.0,Great Chines chicken salad; great place to meet GF's for a quick bite!
Tamar D.,San Francisco  CA,98,519,169,1/23/2010,3.0,"Remember that part in ""You\'ve Got Mail"" where Tom Hanks\'s character is doing a voiceover  where he explains that the reason why places like Starbucks are so popular is because people who have no decision-making capability at all have the opportunity to make ten decisions at once  all just to order a cup of coffee?That\'s this place.I\'m never a fan of the menu that reads for pages....and pages....and PAGES!!! Like  why? Really? We can\'t even retain that much information in the space of ten minutes  especially when we\'re parched and have already consumed half of the pitcher of Hefeweisen that you put on the table. I had the Santa Fe Salad with some salmon and called it a day. One of our party of 7 had the Chili Cheese burger  but you know what? The real name of the burger read like the names that you find at a dog show: Champion Kingsmire Chili Cheese Winnebago Bashful. Crazy menu aside  the place is good with a rowdy group and a nice end to a couple of hours at the driving range."
Denny P.,San Jose  CA,216,30,1,2/28/2012,3.0,In all honesty I think that the better BJ's are located in the South Bay because after coming here  the service was just aaaite and the food is never anything to be excited about. It is a chill place to come with a few buddies to have lunch and catch up or talk about whatever but for the most part it's nothing more than mediocre at best.
Montana R.,San Francisco  CA,0,10,,1/2/2013,4.0,Awesome happy hour specials. Half-price flatbread mini pizzas are great. The bj's hefe is good too. Nice big screen able to be seen from anywhere in the bar. Only negative is that they don't play the sound on local 49er games??? :( otherwise I'd give 5 stars.
Chloe W.,San Francisco  CA,0,12,,8/29/2012,5.0,Excellent service  excellent mixed drinks and the pizzas are surprisingly good. Make sure to get the oreo pizzokie.
Aaron Z.,San Francisco  CA,21,186,92,8/21/2009,1.0,"I guess if you can get in this place you may like it  but I know I will never set foot here. I had a party of 8 and called around 11 a.m same day. Well they only take reservations 24 hrs. in advance. Go figure that one.The girl told me call back 1/2 hour before we come that eve and they\'ll put our name on the list. So  I did. Then  that evening when I called she said it will be "" 3 hours before we can seat 8!!""In the Midwest they do this too- so that people hang out  buy drinks and appetizers and make the place look really popular and busy  when really it is just poor management and not much concern for customers.We ended up in Burlingame   at Steelhead Brewery.I have heard from people who have eaten at BJ\'s  that the menu is nothing special.  I know after this experience  I will never give them my business."
La Toya B.,Sacramento  CA,20,60,24,4/11/2010,4.0,My husband and I came here for Valentine's Day and to our surprise it was not that busy and the wait was less than 20 min. As we waited we were served a slice of pepperoni deep dish pizza  which was so good it almost made me change my mind about what I was going to order. The hostess and wait staff were friendly and accommodating and our food came out hot  fresh  and delicious. Really not a place for the romantics  but if you just want to chill out with the other half or some friends and watch the big screen  this is your place.
Virginia L.,San Francisco  CA,315,181,8,4/13/2009,4.0,"Well shoot  what Bruin hasn\'t been to BJ\'s  being one of the standbys in Westwood? I am no exception. This had been a regular spot all throughout my undergrad  and I thought it was exclusive to Southern California. I was wrong and I\'m happy to see that NorCal loves BJs just as much as the South ;)I think their classic pizza here is the BBQ. It\'s good  but I prefer their Great White. Salads and sandwiches are good (not actually a ""healthy"" option  the way their built  but good). Appies are standard American fare with twice the serving size and heartiness - just the way I like it. Oh yeah  their seven beer sampler is one of the better that I\'ve found in this type of brewery. It\'s probably a true 3  but their pazookie bumps them up to a 4. Plus  the San Bruno location had the best service out of all BJ\'s I\'ve been to  from the host down to the bus boy. A must try at least once  but only if you come hungry."
Felicia G.,Chula Vista  CA,90,32,1,4/8/2012,3.0,Can I just say how convenient it is to live across the street from a BJ's? It's awesome & not so awesome (for my diet) at the same time. Some of our favorites on the menu come from the appetizer list. Specifically - the avocado egg rolls  the chicken wings and the artichoke dip. Don't forget to grab a cider and ale pitcher! I also recently had my first pizookie from BJ's evarrr. My tastebuds were thoroughly delighted. Great spot to take a group of friends. It's loud & lively so don't expect a romantical date.
Iroquois S.,Daly City  CA,1,34,,5/13/2012,4.0,This place is great if you want mouth-watering beer and delicious deep dish pizza. My only gripe is that the pizza is sometimes dry  extra sauce may be necessary. Actually  extra sauce is definitely necessary  request marinara dipping sauce for that pizza.
Tony L.,Rota  Spain,153,539,2697,3/14/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"Went here yesterday with a family friend in tow and sis. The traffic was terrible and raining  but we were seated within 10mins as BJ\'s was as normal packed to the gills. We were seated in the ""lounge""  an area we haven\'t seen yet but from afar  way in the back and flat-screen television monitors all over the upper walls at every angle. I ordered a plate of fried squid which was very good  I was amazed. Our friend ordered a clam chowder but wanted the bread bowl to be served separately; they instead served it inside  so she sent it back. It was returned and seeing the inside of the bread bowl still wet  determined all they did was pour the chowder out and scrape the wet bread out. What kitchen knuckle-heads. Sis ordered a baked potato w/cheese and bacon bits  and a bowl of chili soup. The soup had to be requested again  and the potato had the cheese but no bacon. I have to hand it to our East Coast waiter because he was fabulous though the kitchen help was ""lost in space"" and hadn\'t found their way back to the kitchen.... or elsewhere! I tried a different beer this time and ordered a Lindeman Framboise Lambic  and made in Vlezenbeek  Belgium. WoW!! This is very unlike a beer - very dark but very sweet! Can hardly taste any alcohol in this  and is more like drinking a very strong fruit drink. Very nice if you like the fruity taste!!!"
Sylwia A.,Walnut Creek  CA,120,224,5,5/21/2009,3.0,This used to be our spot for Thirsty Thursdays.... Staff isn't bad  it's hit or miss  we've had good ones  bad ones  great ones  or not so great ones. Drinks are good  I'm a fan of their beer sampler and their girly beer. The deep dish pizza is really good and so are their humung-O baked potatoes. Oh ya  and who could forget the pozookie?!?! Save room for the pozookie  those things are worth it!
Yvonne K.,Belmont  CA,71,107,63,1/2/2010,3.0,While I do enjoy BJ's food  the last 2 times I have eaten here I got sick after. :(BJ's is well known for their pizza and beer. I like the great white pizza and the Jerimiah Red beer. Mmmm... Beer! The potatoes are huge  so make sure you're really hungry if you order one.This BJ's location often has crowding issues since it is located at Tanforan Shopping center. If you are trying to go at a popular time  expect to have to wait. They have great happy hour specials available M-TH from 3-7. They also have online ordering available for those that would rather forgo the wait. This can come in especially handy on lunch breaks at work. You can order it early  say what time you want it ready  and just pop in to pick it up.
Karen C.,Castro Valley  CA,249,360,216,1/1/2010,4.0,I usually come here at lunch time and arrive a little bit before the crazy noon hour  so I can grab a seat at the bar area. That's the trick  is to come on the off hours because it can get really crowded here! There's not much selection when it comes to restaurants in the Tanforan mall  so pretty much everyone ends up here. I order my favorite  the barbequed chicken chopped salad...It is HUGE! The salad is so fresh and crunchy with just the right amount of toppings  chicken  cilantro  jicama  cheese....and drizzled with barbeque sauce. I love it! I usually pair it with a blonde or a hefe beer and it is a perfect lunch that will fill you up through dinner. The staff can be just okay...especially when they are busy  but after coming here for so long  they now know me a little and are a bit nicer....
Roy V.,South San Francisco  CA,54,29,20,2/3/2010,3.0,Always a decent choice when it comes to eating out past 9pm when most other restaurants are already closed.The food is mediocre at best  but there's plenty of room for large groups and the menu is diverse enough so that even the most finiky eater will find something worth eating. The quality of the food  however  leaves much to be desired. The ingredients aren't fresh at all and I have a lingering feeling most of the meals are prepared ahead of time and just need to be warmed or heated through. Despite the generally low quality of the food there is a bright crayon among the box of dull colors. An absolute MUST at this restaurant is the pazooki. Imagine a giant freshly baked cookie served with ice cream. A simple treat that always delivers. Without this delectable dessert I don't think this place would be worth coming back to.
Alex V.,Boca Raton  FL,186,169,18,7/20/2009,4.0,This place is cool. Kinda like a new watering hole for me. Just moved to Millbrae and found this place which is a bout 2 miles from my place. Next to a mall where I can buy my stuff and have an excuse to stop by and get some grub.Been there twice now and the bartenders are pretty cool. They are quick to serve your drink  always helpful and a pretty good pour. Food  I had a Cobb salad the first time I went there and I gotta say  it was pretty good. I think it was like 12 bucks  but it was huge.Second time I went there I had the Cali Burger. MAN!!! I have never had a burger with Avocado. I must have avocado on my burger from now on.The prices are modest. The drinks are a bit high for outside for a suburbia chain kinda place. But I have to say it was pretty good. I will be back.Wait a minute  I think I have to go pick up some stuff at Target tonight  and maybe stumble upon the place again...
Eva J.,San Francisco  CA,11,7,,7/29/2012,3.0,omg this place was loud. typical american. great for large group gatherings but not so ideal for small dates due to the high level of noisiness. we went to celebrate a coworker's birthday  unfortunately we had to wait for a long time to get a big table. i think i heard about them not taking reservations OR we actually did have a reservation but just no big table available. either way  that was a long and awkward wait because some people got to sit at the bar  some had to stand and just awkwardly chatting amongst ourselves. moving on to the food part  and thank goodness food was awesome so i can overlook the waiting experience. i forgot what i ordered but it was delicious. i tasted my friend's seafood pasta and that was also awesome (very spicy  loved it!). so yeah......again very typical of an american birthday party dinner at bj's :)
Natasha I.,San Francisco  CA,39,121,94,5/5/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"This time around I ordered the Iced Coffee which was truly wicked. The frozen glass with chocolate frozen of course  swirled all around and delectable coffee with the right punch of baileys yes it was sinful.We had the ""all together"" appetizer-thats spinach and artichoke dip with multicolored chips and bruschetta. Loved the greasy treat.Rounded it up with the brocolli cheddar soup (again rich and amazing) and boy had the veggie pizza. My only complaint-The waiter hardly checked on us. (Well that and the aftermath of eating way too much. )"
Tim S.,San Francisco  CA,32,43,20,1/19/2010,4.0,"Came here for a late dinner/ drink. I\'ve been here many times before  usually for happy hour drinks and appetizers  but this time I got an entree and a beer.I ordered the Balsamic Chicken which was new to their menu. It was suggested by my waitress who said it was ""really good."" It came with two slices of chicken breast over a bed of salad with a side of cheesy mashed potatoes. The chicken was cooked just fine - I\'m actually surprised as most of the dishes are dry or ""is missing something."" The seasoning was good and I can say I enjoyed the dish. I also had a Blonde beer which is the lightest of all the beers. I don\'t think it complimented the dish very well.Overall  I left satisfied. I\'d go back again for some happy hour drinks and appetizers."
Scott O.,San Bruno  CA,11,39,5,7/20/2010,2.0,The most important thing to know about going to BJ's is that the Hosts will never give you an accurate wait time. Take what ever time they give you and add 15 minutes... at least.Most of the time you're better off looking in the bar area for a seat  because they'll open up sooner than you'll get a table. Sadly you have to pay attention and be ready to move quickly  because there will be someone else doing the same thing.Once you get past the frustration of getting a table things are pretty smooth sailing. The food is what you'd expect  and the staff is ok... The management rocks  or at least the one time I had to deal with them it was great (new server gave our item to wrong table and we had to wait for a new one to be made. Manager gave us our meal for free.)But the frustration of waiting forever for tables  and since you sometimes get a crap waiter... Cheers.
Daniel S.,San Francisco  CA,400,270,32,1/16/2010,4.0,I like BJ's  I come here whenever I can. The only things I order here is the deep dish pizza and split it with whoever I am with. i dont know why but thats the ONLY thing I like here. I have had a burger here once or twice but I usually go for the pizza's! Beers are pretty good. They brew their own beer fresh! All of the beers are micro brew and I believe they have 7 or 8 different kinds. I have had a couple of them. For you non alcoholic drinkers. They have fresh ROOT BEER. I use to always order those (when I wasnt 21 ha) so yea great place. Prices are pretty decent
Mei L.,Los Angeles  CA,208,28,,4/7/2012,4.0,Happy hour and buffalo wings!! Nuff said
Jae V.,San Bruno  CA,23,38,,8/11/2009,4.0,I usually eat here with my friends and it's a pretty good place to hang out and have some dinner. The selection on the menu is alright and everyone is usually satisfied. The servers are okay. There are a couple of servers I've had that were great - friendly and communicative and tried not to keep us waiting too long  and then I've also had one or two that forgot to bring the waters we ordered and one that lost our order completely.The wait time for a table is a little long and they don't seem to have an efficient way of serving the food. But other than that  this is a cool place.
Davon F.,Vallejo  CA,58,92,55,2/20/2012,4.0,The food here was amazing! It was a little pricey but its worth it! Food portions are big! The service was a little slow and the gave me the wrong pizza. took me some time to get the right order but when i did the manager was the one to bring me my food and apologize he also paid for my food and dessert to make up for it! this place also has real good beer! This staff knows how to keep a customers happy
Heather C.,San Francisco  CA,1870,417,735,2/2/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I came here yesterday for the superbowl the drinks were pretty good (i think i had too many though.. -_-;;) and the spinach and artichoke dip were pretty good and so were the chicken wings! the waitress and the bartender were super nice!
R L.,Millbrae  CA,0,13,2,2/8/2014,2.0,I'm giving this a 2 star primarily because of their front of the house hosts. We did a 'call ahead' for 2 people to avoid waiting since there was a 15 minutes wait. When we got there 15 minutes later  they told us it's another 10-15 minutes. 10 minutes later  I asked how many more people ahead of us. I was told we would be next and to just wait until the pager go off. We watch 6 more groups of 2 go  finally 15 minutes later we were called.  So lessons learned  just get there  get a pager an wait. Don't bother calling. The front hosts are rude and unorganized.
Frances V.,South San Francisco  CA,22,183,245,2/17/2012,3.0,BJ's is a good place to hang out for happy hour  that is if you are able to grab a table in the bar area and come early enough to. They have a large selection of beers (microbrews and imports) and wide selection of appetizers and entrees. Otherwise  there is nothing that really stands out here. Just your typical local restaurant and hangout spot. But I will always make room for their pazooki when I come here.
Julia R.,San Mateo  CA,32,83,63,2/17/2012,3.0,The food is tasty but the service is just awful. Either waiting for someone to take your take out order or if dining inside  its always SO SLOW! They have a wide range of food on the menu and everything is pretty delicious  the pizza's are pretty good as well  if only you could get some better servers then this place would be great!
Rob L.,Richmond  CA,80,211,3941,8/31/2009,3.0,"This place is a sports bar and restaurant combination where you take your boys or girls for an evening of watching the local team play an important game  or just a casual night out with friends. There\'s plenty of parking and other options for activity if you have some time to kill afterward  as it\'s connected to the Tanforan Mall which has movies and shopping if there\'s something you need. Since this place is somewhat close to SFO  a traveler with over 2 hours to burn can stop by here before their flight and have a brew!This BJ\'s is easy to get to  as it\'s right next to the I-380 exit onto El Camino Real heading west. Overall  this is a chain  but I\'d consider this place above average compared to other chain restaurants due to it\'s friendly staff and wall-to-wall HD TVs  though it does have it\'s weaknesses as a chain (i.e. long wait for a table during busy hours  basic chain menu of ""gourmet"" foods  etc.)."
Christine C.,San Francisco  CA,191,196,88,5/12/2009,3.0,Solely a food review - Only 3 stars because sometimes the wait is ridiculously long when the food is only 3.5 stars worth...The only items I order here are from the appetizers list: the onion strings (onion-y  greasy and so fun to eat) and the chicken lettuce wraps (can be a little salty but I feel like I'm eating a little healthier than most folks in there because this dish isn't fried). Sometimes like to end with a pazookie but usually am full from the two appetizers (even after sharing with my friends). Tried the pizzas - wasn't impressed but many of them (the BBQ chicken pizza is okay... too saucy sometimes). And the rest of the menu is just bleh. Every sandwich has a cheesy bread  all the pastas have cream sauces - can you say heartburn? Or grease clogged arteries? I'll stick with my two appetizers  yay!
Linda C.,San Francisco  CA,287,496,2513,11/23/2009,3.0,Not a fan of chains  but I wanted pizza so we came here since it's open late. Service was slow and the place was still packed on a Sunday night. - Classic Combo Pizza: classic with your basic pepperoni  sausage  and mushroom  can't go wrong with that  but it's nothing special- Buffalo Chicken Pizza: spicy-my mouth had a nice burn the whole time  a little too creamy and saucy  chicken was good- Chips & Salsa: watery salsa  not spicy at all (i like my salsa chunky)- Piranha Beer: not badWe were too full to try their infamous pizookie. Next time! Great place to watch the game with lots of TV screens everywhere. Service needs work.
Sarah S.,Pleasanton  CA,94,94,4,5/22/2009,3.0,"Oh BJ\'s! I love you and hate you so much. I really only go here cause they have awesome music  and the avocado egg rolls and pazookie  but every time I try and bring someone here  we get totally jipped.FOR INSTANCE  Last night I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. I told the Peasant working the front desk that it was a party for two  she made a weird face and was like ""See  I can\'t even give you a quote time because there is a game"" And I am like  what does that mean? She explains that its the laker game is on and its only the first quarter and that it could be as long as an hour  HEY MORON  THAT IS A QUOTE TIME. I ask her if we can at least have a pager  she says yes. We decide to wait it out. She was like  ok you\'ll have to come back in like 15 minutes for a pager. Whatever. So we can\'t have a pager? asshole. We walk around and then go back in like 20 minutes. Still no pagers. This time its a different girl. and she is like I dont know come back in like 10 minutes. We finally get a pager and the wait is only like 15 minutes. Our waiter takes his sweet time getting to our table and then takes our drink order and appetizer order. We get our appetizer order before our drinks. He comes by and asks how things are going and my boyfriend tells him I would like a water. He says sure no problem as if I hadn\'t ordered one and been waiting. The waiter sucked. SUCKED. He brings us boxes and neither one of us had even requested boxes and both of us were not even halfway done with our food. He didnt even ask us if we wanted dessert  which we most definitely did. I don\'t remember anything after that  the service was dismal and the food was so overloaded with butter that I couldnt even eat mine. Stupid BJ\'s."
Peter M.,Daly City  CA,42,122,17,12/29/2009,4.0,for a chain  this joint is quite good. Lots of tv's...lots of beers...lots of fill-you-up-and-still-have-leftovers-to-box-up portions for very decent prices. My favorites are the texas fried steak  buffalo wings  and you gotta save room to split a PIZOOKIE!pls take note that i'm speakin on the one in san bruno. The one at bridgepoint sucks azz!
Mike D.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,,8/5/2013,1.0,My girlfriend and I came in to get a nice lunch. To cut to the chase  after eating about half of her pasta  my girlfriend found what looked like a giant staple in her food. She informed the waiter  who was a nice enough guy  and he told us he would bring the manager who offered her another order of pasta. He told us it may have fallen in during cleaning?! Uhhh  that does not make us feel any better. Now she also has massive stomach pains. Awesome. If she swolled that staple she could've choked. The least the manager could have done was cover our whole meal  which was only about $20 by the way. So cheap. Never again BJ's.
Albert B.,Hercules  CA,0,37,,6/22/2010,3.0,First  I would like to say that BJs is a chain of restaurants throughout the country. I don't normally yelp on chain restaurants  but this is worth reviewing even though there are 500 plus reviews. My wife and I came here with the family last night and it was unusually busy for a Monday night around 10pm. Our host was friendly and greeted us immediately upon entering the restaurant. He informed us that the wait time would be approximately 15 minutes. We actually waited for almost 25 minutes. The waitress that served our table was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the mozzarella sticks and the Mediterranean deep dish. The mozzarella sticks are good  but nothing special. I ordered the Nit Wit beer and it was okay. My sister ordered a glass of Pepsi and she stated that it was flat. My wife took a sip and she agreed. However  we were all surprised with the Mediterranean deep dish. Pesto  grilled chicken  fresh tomatoes  sun-dried tomatoes  feta cheese  greek olives and jalapenos on the side. Pesto was so good with tons of fresh tomatoes and the right amount of cheese  this deep dish was so delicious. I really enjoyed the deep dish. It was filling and full of flavor. Pesto and deep dish. I never thought of it. A deep dish I highly recommend. I haven't tried any of their other signature pizzas  because Zachary's in Berkley in my opinion is still the one to beat. This is a place that is worth coming back when in the area. I'll definitely order the Mediterranean again. A shout out to Lindsey who served us last night. You displayed a great level of customer service on a busy night. Thank you  Lindsey! Here's a tip: while waiting to be seated  request a menu from the host so you and your party can decide what to order the moment you get your table.
Cathy K.,San Francisco  CA,493,583,848,1/8/2009,2.0,So this is where all the people are on a Wednesday night at Tanforan Mall. This joint was jumpin' for supper - a 45 minute wait.*Good energy.*Service so-so - maybe our server was new? Didn't see much of her.*They brew their own. Blonde Beer was good.*Good menu selection - salads  apps.  soups  pizzas  sandwiches  pastas.*Fries not so good - I tried the Wedge Cut and Skinny.*Convenient to get to from San Francisco - take BART  get off at San Bruno station.
Tahira R.,Millbrae  CA,0,10,,10/13/2012,5.0,Ver helpful employees  extremely cooperative and friendly staff. Once our order was mistakenly understood by one of the staff and they could not deliver it to us because it was not in their stock. Then the manager came and apologised in very humble way and evevn was so generous that he didn't charged us at all . He mentioned that it was their misundersytanding that they thought that order was available in stock. He was apologetic for wasting our time while we waited for the order. Anyways  it seldom happens everuwhere and that was a very nice gesture. Their vegitable pizza and desert platter is always our choice whenever we go to tanforan.
Cee L.,Daly City  CA,232,28,9,8/18/2011,1.0,"Ok I had enough of this place been here twice now the first time was BAD but thought i give it another shot.....ummmm bad idea I second Amanda S. review (previous yelp post) Its funny how i see that someone went through something simular as me and we probably ran into the same waitress. SHE WAS HORRIABLE~ i think it was about that time to take a break or go home for this waitress. She probably only cracked a smile when she was getting ready to seat us then after that it was all down hill. Rushed us to order our food  rolled her eyes while we are trying to figure out what we want and took our order down wrong. Now we ordered lots of food and to have lots of food you would think to fill our waters as much as possible but to have our ice melt and our glasses down to the last drop and have to wait 5-10 min for someone to notice and she came to our table to finally notice we told her more water she walked away w/ slight irritation and forgot to get our water. I won\'t return i can go on more but i\'m pretty sure this sums it all up. She was lucky i didn\'t call the manager cause that day she should of learned a lesson but it was closing soon and i had a long day so the only thing I was thinking about was to go home. FYI: ""FISH & CHIPS=SALLLLLTYYYYYY"" if you want high blood pressure or diabetes go ahead and eat some fish & chips....yuckkkkk never again...basically there was more batter than the fish and to have it so damn SALTY that killed it...I said i wanted the fish NOT THE OCEAN WATER!!!!! good bye BJ\'s"
Mark L.,San Diego  CA,420,244,87,12/4/2009,4.0,one of the nicer lookin BJ's i've been to in California. I've been going to BJs for some time  not like religiously  but a couple times a year.However  this was my first time really partaking in the happy hour deals...damn they have great deals in my time of being a broke grad student; combo that with friends and you get more bang for your buck!Potato Skins= yumChickin Wings= yumBeer= yum$5 personal pizza combo= yum (made a sausage  mushroom  and japapeno one) Cant go wrong.Really like the patio area outside with the fireplace. Perfect for this winter weather up in Norcal.
Michelle Y.,Daly City  CA,32,183,,1/17/2010,4.0,I've been here plenty of times. Mostly during happy hour. It's a good thing I have friends who aren't afraid to stalk and jump at the chance for an open table! hah! The happy hour is pretty reasonable $1.50 off beers...half off pizzas...$2.00 off appetizers...its really not that bad and the food is pretty decent. (for bar food).You def don't come here in hope of having a fine dining experience. Great to hang out with friends and enjoy nice cold beers...
Penguin S.,Houston  TX,141,709,149,6/16/2009,5.0,Always a great place to meet a friend or more for a bite to eat and a brew. The service is hit or miss  often it's a little slow  but other times just fine and always friendly. I love their pizza. A favorite of mine is the half a baked potato and wedge salad at lunch. Everything I've had here is really good.For beer  I always get the Blonde  being a fan of Belgium style wheat beers. Never fails to quench!Anytime I'm meeting anyone for lunch and we can't decide on a place  I always suggest BJs.My only issue is that they often don't have servers for the outdoor seating area. But after ordering at the bar  someone will bring it out to you.
Rebecca O.,Livermore  CA,13,15,12,1/16/2011,4.0,the food was really good..i had the cajun pasta..my virgin mojito was kinda crappy..not worth 5 bucks. anyways  my friend's drink really sucked too  and the waitress forgot to get her another one. then when the bill came we were all figuring out how to split the bill and when the waitress walked by  she mugged us..ok...pshhh low tip for you lady! haha! anyways  the food was great  it's a nice place and i had a good time with my friends
Mike T.,Santa Maria  CA,0,9,,9/28/2012,2.0,We loved BJ's in Irvine a couple of years ago and also the one in Concord  so I was looking forward to going to the BJ's at Tanforan. BJ's has CHANGED over the years  or maybe it's just this one at Tanforan:The BJ's Combination pizza just had a thin veneer of toppings on it. Just a few micro-pepperoni and some Italian sausage bits. Tomatoes. All bread  no substance. I was very disappointed.The good: We were seated quickly. The pizza arrived promptly  after we sent back the first pizza they brought us because it was the wrong one. The beer selection is huge  and the price for a pint draft is reasonable. Medium pizza and two beers: $40 for two including tip.
Vivian L.,San Francisco  CA,314,376,127,4/1/2011,3.0,$32 for Ahi Tuna salsa  CA Chicken sandwich and CA steak sandwich both comes with fries. Service was good.
Maria C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,12,,7/21/2012,1.0,This restaurant has deteriorated in both quality of food and service. We ordered a deep dish pizza. It took over 45 mins to get out the order. Worse yet  the pizza was not hot but lukewarm  like it was some leftover I warmed up in my oven. Service was really bad too. It took no less than 3 times to ask for refills on our drinks. All in all  it took us well over 2 hours to finsh up because of the bad service. I have been to other BJs (in San Diego area) and they have not been this bad. This is easily one of the worst. I know I won't be going to this one again!
Margarita G.,Richmond  CA,0,3,2,7/8/2012,5.0,By any chance  does anybody know a server or waiter there called John? If so  do you know his last name? Much appreciated..
John-Michael C.,Singapore  Singapore,1004,1228,300,10/30/2008,3.0,Come on....you know what you were thinking when you first heard the name of this place too. *evil grinIt's was nice that I lived across the street from the place...made it a whole lot easier to walk back home after a drinking session. Of course if you go earlier in the day on the weekend or so it can get rather busy....hell it can get down right ugly. Scene - walking into BJ'sstopping mid stride and watching a guy fly past me.....and finding myself face to face with an unruly crowd going after said aviator. Otherwise the place isn't bad for a chain micro brewery. Go there after hours and catch the happy hour it's nice.....enough. This particular branch sometimes lights their outside gas fire place. Word to the wise - don't try to light your cigarette while it's still in your mouth.
Bee O.,Daly City  CA,48,22,8,3/16/2012,5.0,Great food great service waitress mariana what awesome  she knows her menu well.. We will come back
Emily L.,San Francisco  CA,129,276,119,1/26/2010,4.0,This place is Great!!!! Doesn't take forever to get seated and the Bar-ish food is good too.I had their Oreo Ice cream trio and it was AMAZING!!Highly recommend it!! We went there @ 11PM and they were still open.EZ parking  good food!will definitely go back!
Monica V.,Valley Glen  CA,25,66,21,12/12/2011,4.0,Decent food. Decent service. I like the casual sports atmosphere. Ate in the bar area. No complaints.
Ann T.,San Francisco  CA,375,350,2928,4/13/2011,3.0,service is just so-so... but they now serve gluten free pizza?! and it's delicious?! LOVE! berry burst cider is also a WIN!
Jennifer W.,San Francisco  CA,205,7,,3/3/2012,2.0,I'm only giving this place two stars because my waiter was nice. Other than that  I had a party of 10 and we waited for 2hours. Even then  we had to ask and annoy in order to get our table. When we finally got our table  THEY DIDN'T HAVE THREE OF THE PASTA ENTRIES. This place is ridiculous. I do not recommend coming here.
R M.,San Bruno  CA,1,15,,8/14/2014,1.0,I am giving this restaurant 1 star because two times in the past month my service was terrible. When I went about 3 weeks ago i got a cheeseburger and it was very good but the fries were cold -_- both me and my friend asked for ranch 2-3 times to 2 DIFFERENT waiters and after 15-20 minutes we received it. that forced us to only leave a very small tip. Thinking I would have a better experience I returned today. I ordered a half sandwich/soup combo. I received my sandwhich eat before the soup ( I thought it makes more sense to bring soup first) and also again the fries were cold. So when I ask for ranch this time tell me why it was THE SAME SITUATION?? literally asked 2 different waiters for ranch 2-3 times and took around 10 minutes  they did a lil better. When I told her I never received my ranch she didn't seem to care and said  'ok I'll get it now' and she wasn't on game with my refills either. this time again  very little tip left and i will most likely not eat here again..
Alice E.,San Francisco  CA,147,407,24,4/26/2009,1.0,Seriously? Service was allllrrigghhhttt. The servers seem overworked. Maybe its a management thing - stretching their employees too thin. /shrugFood was bleh.Mozz. cheese sticks - came out kinda cold so cheese was kinda hard.Garlic bread - overpriced for 4 pieces.. Shrimp Scampi - no flavor! my bff didn't even eat 1/3 of it.Buffalo wings - my husband seemed to enjoy it.Fish n chips - batter wasn't fully cooked  leaving a nasty taste in my mouth. also the fries weren't yummy :( Def was not worth the money I slaved for lol. I am NEVER coming back here... ever ever ever. I feel so strongly against it lol.
Luis A.,San Pablo  CA,2,12,,3/6/2014,1.0,I came in today with a group of co-workers to celebrate my promotion. Now  I had been here before and had a great experience  however  this time it was not what I would expect. The staff sat us down  at first the server was great  he then had to take off for lunch so we were introduced to another server. This new server was bad. He ignored us for 15 minutes  until one of my co-workers got up to call him to our table. Before the food arrived  we  once again  tried to get his attention for drinks-- no luck. Once again  my co-worker gets up--success  drinks. After we finished our meals  we lingered and chatted. We asked for dessert menu  no luck. (How rude!?) Finally  my manager had had it! she asked for bill...it took about 15 minutes to get it. She was fed up  got up  and asked him for amount. He gave it to her  with a snarky attitude  she gave him exact change and we left. We did not even bother speaking with manager. I don't think I'll be returning anymore.
Mark L.,San Francisco  CA,16,27,,5/3/2009,1.0,"I was looking for a nice beer and some good avacado egg rolls before a bit more shopping with the girlfriend so I suggested BJ\'s. We walked in just before 5 PM and it wasn\'t that busy. We sat down in the bar area  not in the middle but off to the side. Clearly in the ""Do not serve"" zone.After 9 minutes and being walked past at least 8 times after we started counting  we walked out. No one even said ""Thanks for coming in"" though that would have been a bit funny.BJ\'s in Cupertino is fairly good. This branch is just cashing in."
Cher B.,San Francisco  CA,23,63,,12/4/2009,2.0,I've come to this BJ's twice...and twice too many!!!The first time I came here  I felt like we were on candid camera--the service was SO BAD. we waited an hour and a half to be seated  we waited even longer after being seated bc the waitress kept forgetting our order  she made us feel awkward by blowing kisses at us (this isn't hooters!!!)  food tasted BAD (it was like the toppings melted together and i didn't know what i was supposed to be eating)  and by the end of the 3-1/2 hour debacle  we vowed never to return.fast forward 8 months later and there I am at BJ's again  waiting to be seated. we were literally the first customers there and still waited 10 minutes (i don't get it??). the food was pretty bad. My grandma called my pizza soggy  and that woman knows what's up! The only reason I'm not giving it two stars is because the server was normal this time and my brother really liked his BBQ beef sandwich.I went to the BJ's in LA frequently and the service and food was always amazing. Maybe it's just BJ's San Bruno that sucks. i am NOT coming back --for real this time!!!
Mike D.,Penngrove  CA,15,58,9,11/26/2011,3.0,lunch is okay  the beer is okay  the food is overall okay. There is way better food in the area  Lucca sandwiches are incredible but have no seating... Good for having a bigger crowd. Sports are nice because of the amount and size of TVs. I do like beer and it is a bit of let down. The competition is tough in norcal... I think dinner here is over priced
Frances L.,San Francisco  CA,0,3,,8/15/2012,3.0,"Definitely mixed reviews for this place. The wait time can be ridiculous depending on what time you go and also the day of the week  which is the main reason to why only 3 stars for BJ\'s. The call ahead ""no wait"" system they have only works if you have a party of 7  which most times we do not have that many. Even for a table of 2-4  it\'s about an hour wait! The food isn\'t bad and there are many options to choose from to conquer any craving. The pizookies are great too! Although this place is great  don\'t know if it\'s worth waiting hours for a table. I guess you can go shopping until the pager beeps."
Joe V.,Boston  MA,175,137,3,5/27/2012,4.0,This place is kind of on the hipster California-style places to eat. Food is good with a very large menu to please almost everyone. The environment is a bit noisy but still acceptable to me. Me likey!
Serge K.,San Bruno  CA,1,42,11,3/27/2010,4.0,Great beers and beverages. I love their prime ribs and snack sampler. The lettuce wraps and their Pulled pork sliders are also delicious. This is a popular place  so get used to stalking tables at the bar or be prepared for a 30 minute wait. The staff has always been friendly and will occasionally come around with appetizers while you're waiting.
Lizzie C.,San Mateo  CA,412,204,22,10/23/2008,3.0,For being another generic restaurant chain  they sure have some good fucking appetizers. The chicken wings are only drizzled with sauce instead of doused in it so it's not as messy  but it's still really good. The nachos are good  too  and the pizza is okay.They have a pretty good lineup of beer as well. I really like their Oktoberfest beer.The only thing that keeps me from going here is that it gets pretty busy and often times there's a long wait. Though  they do have heated outdoor seating  and having a pitcher while sitting out on a [rare] warm Bay Area evening sounds pretty good right about now.
Lily S.,San Francisco  CA,37,85,269,7/18/2009,2.0,The food at this location is Terrible .. We ordered fish N chips and the fish was raw in the inside!!! We were lucky we didn't get food poisoning !We only come here if we are killing time waiting around for a movie @ the Century.. Get your buzz on.
Sam W.,San Francisco  CA,44,122,,5/16/2009,4.0,Came here quite a few times with my friends  and my most recent one was tonight! We had 8 people  and we waited for about 30 minutes. This is considered pretty short for BJ's. I shared a large half/half pizza (Mediterranian and BJ Cheese Burger) with 2 other guys. I also shared a pitcher of beer (Cherry Burst Cider... this is really good! I recommend this!). The pizza here is always very flavorful and absolutely delicious. This time  we didn't order any appetizers  but their appetizers are generally pretty good too. This is a sports bar/restaurant. So there are TV screens everywhere with sporting events. But  sometimes the wait can be really long. But if you can wait it out  I think the food and beer are worth it!
Chris B.,Providence  RI,29,122,21,5/5/2010,5.0,Great beer  attentive service.The flatbreads and the Porter are awesome!
bob l.,San Francisco  CA,0,3,,12/7/2013,1.0,This place is very disappointing to me. First off I called at exactly 7:00pm to prioritize my wait on a table for 7:30pm. I arrive on time and was told my table would be available in 15 minutes. I got a table at 8:30pm. I politely asked what was the point of calling in to reserve a table if I still have to wait an hr. Then this coordinator girl ease drops on my conversation with a nice polite girl and explains to me why in a very rude way. I wasn't even talking to her in the first place. Then I sit down to eat and order a fried calamari that probably got reduce by 50 percent while charging the same price. I know this cause I come often  twice a week at one point. Service is bad too. Never again !
Jean A.,San Francisco  CA,141,192,,12/11/2008,4.0,Going to chain restaurants after living in the city always seems like a sin. But sometimes  when you need the dose of comfort  this is exactly what the doctor ordered ... and always enjoyable with good company. BJ's is one of my favorite chain restaurants in the 'burbs after The E-Bar and Chevy's. Much better than Chilli's and Friday's and millions times better than Applebee's. I never bother waiting for a table at this place since the wait is always at least 45 minutes. So we always end up gravitating towards the bar and try our best to bring out our vulture-like habits. Works like a charm. A few of my favs include the Spinach Artichoke Dip  their deep dish pizzas  grilled burger melt (not for the faint of heart)  garden vegetable potato  and of course their pizookies! The beer's are alright  nothing to rave about. But definitely a step up from your typical 'burb restaurants. Oh and did I mention  their service is great - quick  friendly  cuts to the chase - what I would expect.
Glenn L.,San Ramon  CA,20,477,,10/11/2009,4.0,Yeah I know it a full-on chain  but it is dependable. I like the wings - juicy with a slight drizzle of buffalo sauce and ranch. Just realized I had not had their deep dish pizza in years. We always lean towards appetizer fest - nachos  wings and a cold beer. What else do you want?Oh  be sure to avoid this place Friday  Saturday and Sunday nights - just overrun with people.
Misha F.,San Francisco  CA,519,546,194,1/1/2009,3.0,Uber crowded for the 10pm happy hour deal.Love their deep dish pizzas (BJ's Favorite)  and the delciously fresh pizzokies (cookie topped with ice cream).The beer is good too!
Shaw S.,Daly City  CA,0,4,,2/17/2012,1.0,Never coming to this place again! After waiting half an hour to be seated  our waiter was rude and not a people person. She seated us and didn't ask for our drinks or anything. So we waited another 30min assuming she would come around and ask what drinks we wanted. But NO. We had to call her over. The only good thing about this place is there pizookie. Its just as good as the cookies and creme. I highly recommend red velvet. Come here only if you want your time wasted  tasteless food  and slow service.
Diane S.,Houston  TX,307,944,153,5/27/2011,3.0,i like their small plates so cute and tasty. me and my bestie like the tomatoes and mozzarella salad. at $2.99 Happy hour here sucks only $2 off and only pizzas are discounted i think $5 not appetizers lame. Loaded baked potato chicken Alfredo is good. so is their fettucini Alfredo. In the mall  outside seating too. Pazzokies make everyone go crazy over here its a fat cookie the size of a pizza with tons of ice cream scoops go here for a birthday and buy your friends a pazzoki
James R.,Redwood City  CA,0,6,,6/22/2010,1.0,Food Sucks  Beer sucks and the service really sucks !!!! This happened few weeks back. First they told me that's there's a hour wait then couple of hours later we were still waiting. I noticed that the people working in the front were letting there friends get in first and so I questioned them about that and they strictly denied it. I ask the lady in the front to show me the persons name on the list that just walked in and sat down immediately and she cannot prove it. Instead she made up this lie that they called few hours ago. I noticed few of the customers were losing patience. I remember this lady was so pissed off that she left and the people working at the front were mimicking her and they started laughing. Very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you want poor service. Go to Beach Chalet instead.
Brian J.,San Francisco  CA,0,13,,2/2/2015,4.0,"i was pleased with the food but i don\'t feel they lived up to their ""name"" with the rest of the ""services"" they provided...."
Melinda B.,Daly City  CA,0,22,20,6/21/2012,1.0,I had a lunch and was totally disappointed. The pasta that my nephew ordered was not al dente. I can cook much better pasta than the chef. Then my Fish was so dry and the bruschetta which I expected to be great just tasted plain. I think the chef located in Foster city is much better. The service was not great at all because the waitress did not even got my soda & told her to cancel it.
Colin P.,San Francisco  CA,26,595,42,6/19/2012,3.0,Had bit of a wait for a Saturday night. Our dessert took awhile but was later comped. But the pizza was delicious. Friendly staff.
Stephy K.,Pacifica  CA,9,15,4,12/22/2009,5.0,This is one of my favorite restaurants!BJs is great for casual dinning party's (for a great price)  and take out!If its a busy day (mostly it is) then they would walk around and serve you samples while you wait sitting down. Its a very friendly environment and fancy! Also the food is delicious and at a pretty good price.i HIGHLY recommend it.
Rovie T.,South San Francisco  CA,264,58,67,11/14/2008,5.0,I HART this place because:*Its one of the few that are still open when i get off work.*I welcome gluttony when it comes to my thin-crust basil sausage pizza and berry cider.*One of the server (Reuben) looks like Jesus on dreadlocks. Luv it!*Manuel is the sweetest server because he held my money book when I left it.*Happy Hour late night -nuff said
Chocoolate I.,San Francisco  CA,0,466,746,6/12/2012,3.0,Located in a newly remodeled mall  BJ's has a huge menu  tons of parking and televisions all around. This is a great place to see an important sporting event. The wings are great and  being a brewery  that have a great beer selection. The service can be a bit slow all things considered it is a great place to watch a game provided you show up early to get a seat.
Theresa A.,CA  CA,16,34,1,10/8/2008\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Okay... I enjoy BJ's for the food and the company I come with.Apparently  I've come to the conclusion that this particular BJ's at Tanforan Mall HATES LARGE GROUPS. I just can't seem to win. I bring business  they don't want it. I call for reservations and they tell me they either don't take reservations or they already have 2 -3 groups that are coming in that day... seriously?!?! In always giving other people and establishments the benefit of the doubt  I decided to have dinner there with my cousins for my birthday. I walk in (knowingly that I may have to wait 1 - 1 1/2 for a table) and approach the hostess to put our name on the list for 8 people. We tell the hostess and then she turns around and walks away without word... apparently she left to ask the manager on duty. She comes back and tells us it will be a 3 HOUR WAIT for our table. SERIOUSLY??? 3 HOURS???end of story.. we left shocked and i called Foster City BJ's who were so much more accomodating (see my review on them)conclusion: go to this establishment if you are a party of 4 .. actually that may even be stretching it ..
Mel R.,Pacifica  CA,14,61,2,1/20/2009,2.0,I CONSISTENTLY receive bad service here. I love BJs especially the locations in SoCal  but this San Bruno restaurant is by far the worse of the chain.I always think I go during an off or busy day  but NO - every time I go there's something wrong: the super long wait  the rude greeters who give attitude and don't know a thing about customer service  the inexperienced waiters who lie and mess up orders  the sub-par food quality that made me sick...I'm giving this an extra star because I know the menu offers great food. Too bad this location ruins the BJ's reputation. My suggestion? Do yourself a favor and drive an extra 20 miles and visit the one in San Mateo.
Allan M.,San Francisco  CA,91,214,23,9/21/2008,3.0,"I\'m usually pretty satisfied with BJ\'s...Yeah laugh it out! =]Seriously though  I enjoy eating here...but I feel like my experiences havn\'t been as great lately. Today  I went with my best friend  Helen V. She\'ll be a yelper soon! Anyways  our intention was to just come in for a pizookie and then walk around the mall. But we ended up ordering a few drinks and an appetizer  the tomato basil with Italian sausage thin crust pizza. We weren\'t really hungry...so that was good enough to munch on before we had our pizookie. My problem tonight was that the service was a bit sketchy. We got a table in the ""open-bar"" area...so you don\'t have to wait. That\'s better than waiting 30 minutes for a regular table. But  I felt a bit neglected here. We ordered a half and half oatmeal raisin/chocolate chip pizookie at the beginning so that it would come out right after we finished our pizza...but I think she forgot to put in the order for it. Then when it came out...it wasn\'t what we ordered. I still ate it though because it was hella good. I use to really enjoy the pizza\'s here...but I think that I\'d rather stick to the privately owned joints around the city than to come here again."
Andrew H.,San Francisco  CA,32,92,14,10/18/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Still the same 3 stars.I came here again on my B day. I have to say when you go here for your b day. Things really do change. You get better service  no joke.well of course when it is your b day they give you a desert for free. I forgot what the name was  but it is ice cream on top of a cookie that just basically came out of the oven im guessing.but the custormer service was way better than before.
Andrew B.,San Francisco  CA,75,86,,1/18/2012,5.0,"Seriously  what\'s not to love about this place  especially the post-9PM happy hour?!?!I do love BJs Brewhouse. They have great beer  good drinks  and amazing happy hour (mini pizza  mmm). I\'ve been there with friends weekly for several weeks now and love it. The great white is my favorite  it\'s chicken Alfredo pizza.The only advice I\'d give is to avoid the patio. The servers only seem to come around on occasion  and I think it\'s the ""you\'re stuck with the patio"" kinda thing  so they\'re usually not friendly like you get inside. Maybe it was just a couple bad experiences for me  but just an observation.All in all  this is one of my favorite happy hours in the burbs  so I highly recommend both the drinks and the food. And it\'s a lot of fun. If you\'re a sports fan you\'ll love the place too  I\'m not so it\'\'s not a big deal to me."
Alex J.,Daly City  CA,37,2,,2/2/2009,1.0,"In a way it is cruel to critically review a mid-tier causal dining place like this...kinda like booing at the Special Olympics  but these guys took an inordinate amount of my money  so I feel justified in exacting a little payback.It is hard to put the mediocrity of this place into words; in a genre of restaurant defined by the relentless pursuit of the lowest common denominator  BJs is the Platonic Archetype...the sort of place where you can hear 3 consecutive Smash Mouth songs...really.I happened to be at Tanforan and wanted a salad and my friend convinced me they were the only viable option  so in I go and am confronted by a menu that I can only assume was constructed by the culinary equivalent of madlibs   where ingredients are randomly juxtaposed (can you even taste aioli under bleu cheese?) (side note: Feta is apparently the new ""it-cheese"" of corporate executive chefs everywhere it was on at least one-third of the menu items  so some industrious sourcer must have hit the motherlode). I choose the Garden Salad (w/o Feta) and for 4 bucks more I have them slap some flame-broiled Salmon on it (gots to get my Omega-3 on)...after what seems like 8 Nickelback songs later  the waiter finally shows up with my order and tells me it\'s because the salmon takes so long to cook (uh-oh!). The Salad as it turned out was merely a low-tech delivery system for basalmic vinaigrette (I could have used a straw) and was nearly inedible.The staff was nice and the service was attentive (though no one was wearing enough flair for my money) although there was a weird interlude right before the check when my waiter noticed my fiddling with my iPhone and out of no where goes all Steve Jobs on me  demonstrating all the sweet apps he\'d downloaded from the app store.Like I said  a bit unfair to hold a place like this to any sort of elevated standard  but when I get charged 13.50 for vinegar-logged lettuce and particle board salmon  I must raise a voice in objection."
Judy K.,San Francisco  CA,159,276,107,5/21/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,We come here often and it's turning into one of my favorite restaurants. The service is always friendly & efficient and the food is much  much better than most chains- such as TGI Friday's and Applebee's  etc. Order the BRUSCHETTA- although not traditional  their version is very good. It helps that the bread is fresh baked. I think they use their pizza dough. Any of their PIZOOKIE desserts will NOT disappoint- although the Apple Crisp is surely the best one. One PIZOOKIE is enough to feed at least a few people after a full meal. Do try the BJ'S FAVORITE Pizza also!During peak dinner times on the weekends  it can take quite long to get a table but you can call ahead and still be placed on the waiting list. Once you arrive  they give you a buzzer...we like to kill time at Barnes Noble.
ABC Z.,San Francisco  CA,49,151,43,8/29/2011,5.0,SWEET POTATO FRIES (especially) + PIZOOKIE TO THE MAX!!!
Jojo N.,Pleasanton  CA,736,430,188,7/31/2010,2.0,BF and I came here after he picked me up from SFO from my awesome VEGAS trip with my girls! Anywho  I was very disappointed at the food. The clam chowder was so salty  my sandwich was disgusting  and the only thing edible were my fries. BF wasn't impressed either. Wait  we did think the Oatmeal Pizooke was pretty decent. They also gave the pizookie for free since it was my birthday. :)
Mark T.,Millbrae  CA,159,93,7,2/22/2011,2.0,All I can say is this restaurant is always so crowded and noisy and the service is mediocre.  If a table isn't available  which is often the case  they'll be happy to seat you in the bar area to eat where you'll then be forgotten about. The food isn't much to brag about although the cocktails are good.  Just don't come here if you intend to eat and have conversation unless you enjoy yelling the entire time.
Edward W.,Cotati  CA,1,4,,5/16/2012,1.0,"Worst! Ordered all you can eat soup and salad  received 1 soup and 1 salad before our waiter disappeared for 25 minutes. Asked another waiter for refills  got the ""I\'ll let your server know"" line. After finally locating our waiter (my sister YELLED \'Hey dude!\' across the restaurant to get his attention)  he said he would be right back with refills. This never happened. The next time he appeared was when he was apologizing to the table next to us for mixing up their credit card with another table\'s and charging the wrong amount. He then asked them if it was OK if he left it that way! When he finally brought our check (still no refills)  we insisted that he take the soup and salad off. He did  and also stated quote ""Sorry  I\'m not a very good server."" LOL! He then reassured us that it was OK if we didn\'t leave a tip. Thank goodness... I was torn about that HA! This place blows."
Ryan D.,Bellevue  WA,34,61,24,6/28/2009,2.0,I'd say the place was about 75% full when I stopped in for dinner. Server took my order and that was the last I saw of her the whole time I was there... this was pretty bad as there was no sign of my order and my drink had gone empty after 30 minutes. I was ignored for the whole time... I should have napped. My salad arrived after 45 minutes (on the dot). The place was clean  outdoor seating available  TVs to watch while you wait forever  and the salad was good  so there's the 2 stars  but it was a salad and I was hungry before I decided to go to a restaurant.Your time is valuable... I don't recommend eating here because I know you have important things to take care of.
amelia g.,San Francisco  CA,350,190,8,6/27/2011,3.0,i've never had a bad experience here! the staff is always on point but the food is not consistent. sometimes it will come out super salty... and sometimes it comes out perfect. wtf!?buuuuuuttt!!!!... as for some plus's.... i usually order very specific things or ask for special instructions with my food and they put up with it every time. in fact.. they ENSURE that its exactly what i want before they bring it out to me... THAT my friend  is impeccable customer service! AND!.... their bbq chicken salad is always fresh  always delicious!definitely a pretty chill place to eat and drink.
Kat B.,San Mateo  CA,74,85,8,9/21/2011,2.0,"this review is mainly for the service  and not the food. bjs food is basically the same at every bjs  and sadly enough  so is the awful awful attitude of their employees. i called ahead at 7pm  for a table for two. i spoke to a girl  didnt catch her name  she told me it would be 45-50 minutes. i walk in with my husband  exactly 43 minutes later  and i go to the host desk to check in. the asian girl (so so incredibly rude) tells me that ive only been waiting for about 20 minutes  and its still going to be another 30 minutes. I tell her  no  I called in 45 mins ago. she tells me well  you have only been in our system for 20. I pull out my phone  and i show her my timestamp. she says ""oh  well maybe one of our take out people took down your name and gave it to us 20 minutes late. your wait is still another 20-30 minutes."" 1. regardless of the fact that this situation is just plain stupid  the girl had the audacity to say ""you\'ve only been waiting for 20. you still have another 30 ahead""  look  you are wrong. and not only are you wrong  you should have said something along the lines of ""im sorry ma\'am  we show here you just checked in 20 minutes ago"" but instead she got super attitudey like i was being an obnoxious guest  pressuring them for a table. she says theres nothing else she can do  gives me a pager  and tells me i have to wait another 20 minutes. fine. i take the pager  and sit down  very upset that this little biatch is speaking to me very rudely when a. i am the guest and b. i have already been walking around the mall for 45 mins waiting.i return to the host desk 20 minutes later  ive now waited an hour+ a few for a table for 2  when i was quoted 40-45 minutes. the SAME RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE asian girl says to me""no one has been seated. there are still 12 people ahead of you.""now  I used to work for bjs  for 4 years. i started off as a host. I was a host before they had the computers to do all the math for them  i had to use my brain and estimate wait times myself  and coordinate tables and stagger seating myself. i also was one of the first people to use the new posi system for table management. i also was in take out  i was a server  and i was a trainer for all three departments. I KNOW HER JOB  IVE HAD HER JOB  AND I KNOW YOU DONT TALK TO GUESTS LIKE THAT. but  far be it from me to say to her ""look bitch  i am the guest. the GUEST  not the customer  the GUEST""instead i just bitched my husbands ear off and sat in the corner with a very upset look on my facefurthermore  i know bjs is the type of corporate restaurant where you talk to a manager for one little thing  BAM free dessert or comped SOMETHING. but no  i didn\'t take advantage of that  i didnt throw this girl under the bus  i just silently stewed. i am clearly irate at this point  and the girl is adamant about making me wait an hour and a half on a damn thursday for a table for 2. the very NICE girl behind her (tan  maybe hispanic girl  wearing glasses i think?) said ""we have a table  we can take her""UH?HELLO?anyway  our server was great  she was like a robot  ""have you made your selections or would you like a few more minutes"" type thing  everything was to bjs fantastic corporate standards. food was bjs  and as usual  i tipped 25%  because  i know a server doesnt live off of compliments or warm fuzzies.heres a tip  hosts  you are the face of the restaurant. you are the first person the guest encounters during their meal. if you fucking piss them off with your snobby ass holier than thou attitude  you\'re just setting a bad tone for dinner  and a bad tone for your servers\' tips.its customer service. expect to be shat on  expect to be treated poorly  by people many levels below your social class. but its your fucking job  do it right  be grateful you have a job in this economy  and try to keep it."
Danny C.,Daly City  CA,205,43,2,9/20/2011,3.0,I've always been a fan of BJ's. This one seems alright  but the past couple times I've come here the waiter has forgotten to give me the HH discount and needed to be corrected. Not that I blame them too much since it's always really busy.

Daniel A.,Alameda  CA,7,464,8,10/31/2011,1.0,The food is ok  but the service has been terrible every time I have been there. I work in the service industry so I have a lot patients  but after coming here 3 different times  the servers just don't seem to care. It's serving 101 to simply keep the drinks full and check up on your table at least once during the meal.
Jennifer G.,Alameda  CA,21,65,16,8/6/2011,4.0,I've been to this location twice now the first time a 5 star the second more of a 3 star. Great Place to watch The SF Giants Games! The first time: We got seated and our server was super nice and honest about what dishes he liked and why (always a plus) then after our drinks arrived he was going on his break and the server who was covering his tables was also a really nice. There cream soda (w/free refills) are so yummy and comes in a frosty mug. I had ordered a crispy chicken salad w/honey mustard dressing it was HUGE but sadly my leftover didn't hold up because of it being mostly iceberg lettuce and a lot of dressing...next time I decide to order this I will ask for it on the side. Also there Pizzokie (pizza-cookie) the red velvet w/white chips and a scoop of vanilla yum. The second time I came here for dinner: while waiting one of the staff came around and was offering pizza...um okay...Mmm yummy well that was my appetizer. Got seated server seemed to have other things on her mind since she kept looking away while we asked questions  got the orange soda this time since it looked yummy the last time...it came in a mug but wasn't cold and they don't put ice in the sodas. I got a side salad to start and two small plates the fried Artichoke hearts and The Mac and Cheese...lets just say I don't remember on the menu that there was bacon in the Mac and Cheese...that was only in the bottom of the dish slightly cooked :/ gross! But more leftovers to take home on Bart is always a good thing :)
Dana F.,Pacifica  CA,0,38,,1/31/2011,2.0,First off the food is usually excellent at this Bj's  so the cooks have it together here. More than can be said for other BJ's but what this place is lacking in is competent servers. The greeters are all very friendly and competent  but the servers are worthless. Thank god the food is not delivered by these morons or the food would always be ice cold.   This place can get pretty busy  but the only two things they do is take orders and serve drinks  thats it. And theres a dozen of them on the floor so they couldn't possibly have more than 5 tables each.   Every time I find myself with empty drinks  every time I find myself waiting eons for the check  or the check to return. Every time I start out planning on giving a 20% tip  but usually theres only a dollar or so left after put one  by one back in my purse for every minute watching the waitress pick her nose.
Alma C.,San Bruno  CA,22,28,5,12/20/2011,4.0,I know it's a chain  but it so good! The mozzarella sticks could use a little more goo  but aside from that  I love this place. It's usually quite busy  especially during the holidays so definitely prepare to wait for a table. It's good  they have a lot of TV's and it's young. Happy Hour wine Tuesdays are good thing to have on your list of things to do during the week. Good stuff!
Steven T.,Hayward  CA,0,2,,1/3/2014,1.0,Worse experience ever  went here with my brother for lunch before we go shopping and i regret it terribly. We got seated right away  but we waited 20 minute for our waiter to come take our order or at least take down our drinks  but no one came. We ended up having to ask the host who our waiter was  waited another 5 min and we were just fed up and was about to walk out when the manager came by and apologized and he didn't even know what was going on  we ended up ordering here  we were hungry and didn't want to look for somewhere else to eat. I ordered a ahi tuna salad and a drink and my brother ordered a crusted chicken dish with soda  he tried offering us appetizers but i didn't want any. We waited for about 15 minute for our food to come  while i waited i see the manager chatting it up with the waiters and waitresses near the computer where they input orders. I was disappointed i paid 15 bucks for a plate of crap..i literally got a plate of salad with maybe 2-3 piece of ahi tuna which was covered in tons of wasabi and the size of a quarter  it literally looked like i got scraps of whats left over  the whole plate was loaded with fried oily crisp  and throughout the whole time we still had no waiter. We ended up paying full price for our food. Lets just say..this is the last i will ever eat here.
Meesh K.,San Francisco  CA,123,174,34,9/24/2008,1.0,"Had a brain fart after my hand and ass clenching experience at the dentist the other day. Hours after starving myself and starting to come off the numbing lidocaine  for SOME reason I was like  ""Screw it  BJs it is"". And BTW  Tanforan Park Mall...with all the renovations and big sparkly lights...it\'s still a joke (Except for ULTA  I can dig that). Even my fiance was like  ""Really?"" I must have been trippen  had a quick mental image of a great cheeseburger  or something. I didn\'t even order one. To tell you the truth  the sandwich and soup lunch combo is worth it. I actually liked the clam chowder  and turkey club with thin fries. Our waiter was what friggin pissed me off  and I didn\'t even get his name. You know why? Because we BARELY saw him. He took our order  and pretty much delivered our check  and that was about it. Other workers were serving us  and tending to us (Thank you  nice  non-neglecting workers). Our waiter seated another couple AFTER us and they were served food BEFORE us. Decent grub  but shitty service. I don\'t think I\'d even want to go back after that. Pizookie-shmazookie. Go to Lucky\'s and buy some cookie dough  and vanilla ice cream. Head over to Bed Bath and Beyond  and buy a small  shallow  metal baking pan. Stuff the pan with your cookie dough  bake at 375-400 degrees for 10 minutes. Pull it out  scoop ice cream on that bitch. Serve it up to the homies  and watch them oooh and ahhh. THERE YOU GO  I just saved you a really crappy trip to BJs."
Nha H.,Antioch  CA,320,248,58,5/4/2011,5.0,5 stars for great service. I normally don't like Bjs because they don't have great food selections and service is blah  but this location is great. My friends ordered a pizza and our waiter caught it right away that the pizza that came out was incorrect and even the manager came out to offer free soup or salad while we waited. That's the type of service that deserves to be recognized for.
Maggie H.,San Francisco  CA,213,97,4,6/9/2009,4.0,The food is consistant and reasonably priced.The wait (if I could underline  I would underline WAIT) staff is always friendly  which means the hostess' always seem to have a huge chip off (on?) their shoulder. (The phrase kinda of slips my mind at this time... ha.)The wait for a table is a nightmare but time can pass by quickly if you are with good company.The happy hour starts at 10:30PM and appetizers and pizzas become pretty cheap.And make sure you save room for a pazookie  mmm.

Mikhaila A.,Los Gatos  CA,2,214,27,4/24/2009,2.0,"This is just a review on the service...other than this  BJ\'s food has always been great and yummy..but the service here is terrible! I\'ve come here multiple times and always think I\'ll be greeted by a friendly waiter..but no. The other day I came in with the bf and we ordered a salad and a burger..He asked for the 1000 island dressing that came with the burger on the side. We got our food and his burger had the dressing on it and when I told our waiter  he was totally unapologetic and acted as if we didn\'t tell him when he probably forgot...It took 10 minutes for a new burger. And thennn  he never checked with us to see if our food was okay or if we needed more water (which we did). And as a waiter  the rule of thumb is either ""two bites or two minutes"" meaning check in with your table asap and he didn\'t...And we were never given any silverware so I had to hunt down other waiters for that. Boo. Our food was good though  I really wish BJ\'s corp or higher authorities could hire more efficient people to accompany their great food."
Judd H.,South San Francisco  CA,29,38,,2/5/2009,3.0,"BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewery has become somewhat of a stomping grounds for me and my cronies  but the question is why?BJ\'s is located on the outside of the futuristic looking Tanforan mall. You will know you have found BJ\'s when you see what looks like a poor mans spaceship  if you see a legit spaceship you have probably walked to far (New Mexico).Now the service really depends on what time you get there. If you get their at prime times  you\'ll be seated promptly and taken good care of  and by prime time i\'m thinking 7pm to 7:03pm. The service here is pretty poor. I\'ve actually got my meal and desert and check before I even to a glass of water  amazing right?Now the food is pretty good  I mean nothing outstanding just good. However  the prices are quite ridiculous. Pasta is at least 12 dollars (you can get a way better pasta for that price almost anywhere else). Appetizers are at least 10 bucks (other than the wings you are being ripped off)  basically you are paying for somewhat high class food but receiving low brow hobo food.Now I posed the question how has this establishment became a common stomping grounds for my cronies and I  well one reason is it opens late  but there is another reason. The same reason why i\'ve given this place 3 stars instead of negative 2. Every weekday night from 10pm to close BJ\'s has a special  a happy special  where for those 4 hours everyone is happy  and joyful  and and the costumers are happy because of this special  I forget the name  but I think its called ""10pm to Closing costumer joyful hours"". Whatever the name is  it is awesome Mini Pizzas prices are 50 percent off (still amazingly it cost 43 dollars)  appetizers are 2 dollars off  and beer is also 1 to 2 dollars off. However you have to sit at the bar or bar area to receive this behemoth of a discount. All in All BJ\'s sucks for like 10 of the 14 hours it opens  the other 4 hours are Meh..."
David M.,San Francisco  CA,21,25,4,9/28/2011,2.0,came here on a monday  server forgot to give us utensils  gave us the wrong deep dish pizza we ordered  had to ask for napkins since we didnt have utensils and gave us some after like 30 mins. ordered ribs  dry not as good either.btw ordered Italian sausage with mushrooms deep dish  instead we got italian sausage with tomato deep dish  was good but prefered what we.did order.
Csndra L.,Anaheim  CA,4,92,2,8/5/2008,1.0,"Alright so I\'m sitting here right by the bar at the moment  service at first was efficient until we finished our appetizers. Although I did wait 5 minutes for my fucking shirley temple..ANOTHER waiter brought it out.Our waitress gave us our check and we ordered a pizza that we never got and it wasn\'t even on the bill  so we flagged her over here and we complained about it. Not admitting at fault  she makes up this bullshit that she couldn\'t hear us ordering a pizza when she took our orders.Ok so when we got the manager  he gave us a complementary courtesy card worth $25. Then he even said he\'ll pack the pizza on the house with no charge  I was thinking ""hmm how redeeming of him giving us free pizza."".....but it was too fucking good to be true  I got home and I was gonna have a slice when I notice the damn thing wasn\'t even cut.How annoying...."
Elliot Y.,San Jose  CA,110,211,103,4/7/2009,3.0,Tell me why there is always a waiting list for this place even though there are tables/booths that are empty. Standard answer 15 mins - 45 mins eh? Good thing there is a shopping mall to walk around at while they set up the empty tables. The food here is ok. I ordered the ribs  for few dollars more you can have a full rack plus a side! A meal here is not complete without a beer. The appetizers are standard and worth it to share with a group of friends.Plus stars for the interior and exterior decor!
Gustavo C.,South San Francisco  CA,98,63,3,6/27/2011,3.0,Good beer/drinks and atmosphere if you just wanna kick back and grab a quick bite. Food is nothing special though. Friday and Saturday nights can get kinda busy so make a reservation to be safe ;-)
Bobby T.,Pittsburg  CA,77,121,86,8/6/2009,5.0,1. Pale Ale2. Beer3. Nachos4. Deep Dish Chicken Pizza5. Chicken Fried Steak6. Pizooki!total: $75.00 with tip. and I tip BIG!Dinner with Boyfriend: PricelessThe service here was impecable. The waitress was totally hitting on both of us.. it was kinda fun. Water was always filled. I love this place. Would totally go back again and again. So super Yummers
Terry S.,San Francisco  CA,18,108,2,3/30/2011,3.0,I love going here  the food could be better. But i definitely like the appetizers and who can deny the pizookies?
April D.,Oakland  CA,79,363,6,2/13/2009,4.0,So maybe the deep dishes here are not classic Chicago style  but they're still pretty dang good. I really like the buffalo chicken pizza. Mmmmm. And the pazookies are good too. I mean they're nothing that extraordinary  but a big ole cookie in a little pie pan with a scoop of ice cream on it is a cute idea for a dessert and it's yummy. I like the feel of the place too. You get the warm family vibe  but with much more appeal than Denny's  IHOP  or Lyons. Most likely because BJs got the booze.
Yen C.,Oakland  CA,155,120,2,4/30/2011,3.0,came here with bf and a few friends. it was a nice day out so we sat outside  but it got a bit windy.anywho  service took FOREVER. we asked to get new glasses for our pitcher of beer because the ones we received were dirty. waiter goes on to say that the reason why it looks dirty was due to the dishwashing liquid. however  i had to point out that there was some leftover food on the glasses. ew! although the food usually is always good...i always have to mark them down for their service and non-cleanliness of the dishes.
Tanya P.,Lafayette  CA,309,858,82,7/29/2008,3.0,Beer is the most interesting thing here. And looks like the space can be converted for office parties. Food is all over the map but the most reliable choice in the area. Loads of healthier options if you don't want the battered and fried.Have yet to experience a perfect ordering and receiving experience but staff is very efficient and friendly and eager to help.
Sam T.,San Francisco  CA,222,366,217,6/9/2008,4.0,It is incredible how many LA sports fans show up during big sporting events. The Lakers  Dodgers and even Angels? I thought the Angels were the other other LA baseball team. Crazy how many Angels fans popped up during the World Series. That being said... That also goes for all the New York and Boston fans.I enjoy grabbing something to eat at BJ's because I can hang out at the bar area and catch a game on one of their many tvs.Much like Elephant Bar  I do not come for fine dining. I come for some drinks  brew  fries  wings  chips  burgers... while I can cheer on the Warriors  Giants  & Niners!
Mashimaro M.,San Francisco  CA,12,230,4,3/2/2011,5.0,I know that they are all chains but I prefer this location. The staff is a lot friendlier and it's less crowded. This last visit  all we did was order tons and tons of appetizers at the Bar. We wanted to try a bit of everything so the 4 of us ate $100.00 of appetizers alone. LoL.
Mark Q.,San Jose  CA,77,66,30,6/11/2009,2.0,Casual dining with a nice cold glass of beer but nothing special.Menu:Wide range of appetizers  BJs Pizzas  pasta dishes  GIANT baked potato and burgers. I always go with the deep dish BJs Pizzas. The great white is my favorite. The food is good and nothing fancy about it. Portions are big especially if you get the baked potatoes. DrinksWide selection of beer from ales  lager  to stouts. Small wine selection. If your not sure what beer to get  order the beer sampler. Service:I've been to this BJs several times (5+) and each time the service has been lousy! The service is slow  they don't check on you  the food took too long  servers didn't take our order in a timely matter  or our drinks were never refilled. I'd give this place 3 starts but the service brings it down to a 2. Location:Adjacent to the Tanforan mall.Ambiance: Very casual sports bar look with a couple big screen TVs in the bar area. Great place for a casual group lunch or dinner.
Diane M.,San Francisco  CA,1652,403,2450,8/30/2008,2.0,There really is nothing great about this place. It's just a typical chain with mediocre food and service. It seriously is a place to go if you happen to be in the area. You seriously are better off at either the Olive Garden or Red Lobster. Better food at similar prices.
Attila H.,Long Beach  CA,0,6,,11/29/2010,1.0,Placed an order online and when I got there to pick it up I found that they messed it up. Thanks BJs!
Eudora Z.,San Francisco  CA,224,51,19,7/24/2010,4.0,Always a good place to hang out and relax with some friends while eating and drinking. Friend of mine needed to relax and drink away all her stress and problems; Thus  I suggested BJ's. Beer + cocktail drink + thin-sliced pizza + appetizer= great afternoon lunch. If I were given a choice  I'd choose B.J.'s over Elephant Bar.
Katelynn L.,San Francisco  CA,75,405,881,3/7/2009,4.0,I highly recommend calling in to put your name on the list  especially on Friday and Saturday nights. It's usually an hour to an hour and a half wait but at least you can be doing something fun while you wait instead of hearing everyone at the restaurant b*tch and whine about how long the wait is.I came here with my boyfriend last night because I was craving some Chicago deep dish pizza and theirs is pretty darn good. We got a large pie (half Mediterranean and half Great White) as well as the soup and salad combo (we chose the clam chowder and Caesar salad). Their pizza really hits the spot. The crust is amazing ~ very crispy and not doughy at all. The clam chowder was also surprisingly good...actually better than a lot of the ones I've tried at other places. The Caesar salad was okay...you can't really screw that up.All in all  it was a pretty good dining experience. Our server was nice and checked in with us at the right times. But the service there is really hit or miss. I've had some not so great service from them before (i.e. our server would forget to bring us stuff  or they would disappear for 10 minutes before finally getting us what we want).Oh yea...you have to try their pizookies. Who doesn't love a fresh baked cookie with ice cream? But if you're watching your diet  then skip dessert at BJ's and head on over to Orange Tree for some fat free fro-yo ;)
Tracy T.,San Francisco  CA,722,649,370,7/10/2008,3.0,This restaurant NEVER fails to make me wait at least half an hour or more for a table no matter how large or small my party is. Whether it be blossom hill  cupertino  los angeles  sacramento or this location  i've been to all  i've had to wait...somehow it's always a spur of a moment decision to go to BJs for dinner (esp. the ones in the mall: oakridge and tanforan)  so I ALWAYS end up with a wait time for my tables. I even had to wait for the opening bar seating here when I went with my BF one night. Other than that  the service is slow. It can vary sometimes and the wait time can be interchanged  removed  added  whatever. But it usually goes like this: wait time for order  waiter disappears  wait time for food  can't find waiter to request for something  wait time for whatever requested  wait time for check. Not a very intelligent choice when you are pressed for time for a quick dinner  but good for catching up with friends.Favs: -Avocado eggrolls. I hate avocados  but this is good when dipped in the sweet tamarind sauce that comes with it to mask the avocado taste. -BJ's favorite pizza/BBQ Chicken: Deep dish is my favorite  love the fluffy thick crust. BJ's fav is like a combination pizza with lots of meat and veggies. The BBQ chicken is made with bbq sauce and it tastes a little sweet and tangy. -Stuffed potatoes: These are ginormous! It's really filling  but I'm not a baked potatoes kind of girl. A spoonful and I will be good without it for the rest of the night. - Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta: My favorite dish of all time here! Not too rich or creamy. Just the right amount of light sauce  tons of shrimp and tomatoes. It's mouth watering just looking at it!-Bj's famous Pizookie: Can't forgot to top off your dinner with this hot baby. Oatmeal raisin  please! A warm cookie with ice cream on top. What a perfect way to end a night of being a heffer!
Leah A.,San Diego  CA,206,101,19,4/9/2011,4.0,I like going to BJs because they have good deep dish and I love love love their Pazookie's. This location also has tons of TVs for you sports fans out there and their beer that they brew is really good also. However  the main reason why I won't give them 5 stars is because for this location...i'm not a fan. I personally don't like having such a huge crowd because of the mall. The location is convenient for where I live but I prefer some of the other locations that they have.
O'Shea J.,San Francisco  CA,32,162,6,9/17/2008,1.0,"""I\'ve never had anything good at BJ\'s.""That\'s what I always say when someone suggests going here. Been here 4-5x and not once has my meal been any good. They have a good selection of beer  I\'ll give em that. The pizookie also gets two thumbs up but do yourself a favor  eat elsewhere and tell your friends you\'ll meet them there after for drinks."
Bubba L.,Belmont  CA,60,22,12,9/30/2011,4.0,The wait here is usually long round dinner time but the servers are always very friendly and polite. I have three children and Bj's always has a booster or high chairs available. The menu is growing and the beer is good. The tv's are always tuned to multiple sports so waiting on your food isn't as big a deal as other places. I love the wedge cut fries and sandwiches  I also recommend the parmisian crusted chicken! The loaded baked potato is a little big but decent. My family and I enjoy Bj's when we have the time to wait.
Kerrin M L.,San Bruno  CA,1,7,,8/24/2012,3.0,For a chain restraunt the food is ok. It gets crowded and loud and the service is hit or miss. The bartenders are friendly but its hard for me to accept that they card me everytime even though i go there a couple times a week for at least a year now. I know rules are rules but really? The staff knows i am over 21 at this point so why?
Paul J G.,San Francisco  CA,47,39,9,6/22/2009,2.0,THIS PLACE SUCKS... No pun intended. These two stars are meant to be a solid 1.5 (they have nice art deco train paintings... And ok beer). Servers are career sh!t head service people who think they're in the movie Waiting... I have huge respect for servers and the Food industry  this place doesn't get it... Will be back if I'm in the mall and I want a beer at 10am...Once again  this place blows... No pun intended.
Gina K.,Houston  TX,285,409,439,1/14/2009,2.0,No hello or acknowledgment from our server until 10min after we sat down. Their Pizza's and salads are ok and then it goes downhill after that. Jambalaya tastes no where near cajun  it had not hint of spices  it was more like Chef Boy'R Dee. All their food is bland. The servers and a manager give off an distinct air of apathy that shows in their service. The place looks nice with their lighting and tv screens and is great for hanging out with friends. Serving drinks until 11. Pass on the food  way bland. Actually had to send it back and just ask for the check.
Monica N.,San Mateo  CA,47,141,33,8/3/2008,3.0,I've been to this location countless times. I've never actually had to put my name down and get a pager  usually because of the fact that I refuse to do so. I normally head straight for the bar  but if tables are scarce there I just circle the area like a vulture until I find a space. This tactic hasn't failed me yet.Anyway I hadn't been back in a while and my cousin and I noticed some new menu items. Admittedly  one of them's a real winner: the Grilled Burger Melt. It's a whopping 1/2 lb. of Angus beef  with cheddar and Swiss cheese  plus my ultimate favorite: caramelized onions!!! What really makes it a standout is the grilled sourdough bread. Even better  I think it's actually garlic bread. I couldn't even put the thing down... seriously. It was that good.So why the average rating? Well  the place was hardly packed and service was slooooooowwwwww.
Angela H.,Daly City  CA,122,497,,3/28/2008,2.0,"I don\'t know why and how I got the impression that I would be getting Chicago-style pizza from BJ\'s  but I did and I was super disappointed to have got what I did during a lunch there. Though they promised ""a culinary masterpiece""  what I got instead was a humdrum  run-of-the-mill pizza.I decided to go with a BJ\'s Favorite mini pizza  which was $8.90 for a lunch portion- a little steep considering that it wasn\'t that much different from the pan pizzas I could get at Target\'s Pizza Hut Express. Unfortunately  the crust was pretty greasy and unappetizing. I thought that perhaps the toppings (meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions and fresh tomato) would help  but they didn\'t because there wasn\'t all that much of them. There wasn\'t enough sauce and the cheese wasn\'t completely melted. Ughh...I wouldn\'t be back for the pizza  but I may be for other items on the menu. The burgers looked good..."
Cindy S.,San Jose  CA,13,107,33,9/11/2010,4.0,This is the first BJ's I've ever been to and I fell in love with their deep dish pizzas and pizookie! It was a LONG LONG wait to get seated. They gave us one of those beeper things and we practically waited forever but the food was so satisfying the wait didn't even matter anymore. I have had some pasta dishes which were good but isn't to die for. Cheaper than the Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.
Cindy G.,South San Francisco  CA,9,27,4,7/27/2009,3.0,This place is always packed. When I don't feel like dealing with the parking and traffic woes of SF  BJs is a good alternative for some food and drinks at the bar  especially during happy hour when you get more bang for your buck. They also have a heated outdoor patio with a fire pit for those sunnier days  which don't come often enough in San Bruno. I usually order a bunch of items from their appetizer menu to have with a Nutty Brunette (she's my beer of choice there). Their chicken wings are the best. The sliders are good too  even better with cheese and bacon. I also like their chicken wrap  but be careful with the horseradish sauce. It looked like some kind of mustard sauce so I poured a generous amount onto my wrap  which gave it so much kick that it brought tears to my eyes. If you have a bigger appetite  you can't go wrong with their pizzas. SO good. I just wish their entrees were better. Oh  if you do get dessert  try the pizzookie. It's a giant chocolate chip cookie in a pan straight out the oven. Pretty darn good  but then again  I'm a sucker for warm chocolate chip cookies.
Rosavida C.,Santa Clara  CA,235,253,236,6/15/2008,4.0,if you don't like the wait  grab a Hef from the bar and shut up. Sit outside and smoke. [you're not supposed to but people do it anyway] Besides  they make it up to you by giving you a free teenytiny slice of pizza  so no harm no foul. Teases.When you finally make it in there  get a BBQ chicken pizza or the wings. that's all I get and that's the only reason i come back. w0oh0o!
U T.,San Francisco  CA,0,9,4,12/27/2013,1.0,THIS PLACE HOSPITALIZE ME FROM FOOD POISON! My buddy and I went to watch a movie  so conveniently BJ is near by. We ask the front person how long is the wait  she told us 20 minutes  but we ended sat down around 60 minutes. Not much promising estimation on seating. I ordered this Alfredo or cheesy grilled chicken with pasta. The next morning I came down with a stomach flu with a severe bug issue from the grilled chicken. I was hospitalize for a week and place on antibiotic for two weeks. I contact the corporate office  they apologize  but try to contact the restaurant and they told the restaurant what happen. I tried to contact the restaurant because the corporate advice me to  to complete the investigation  but with no response from this franchise. I ask for the manager  but end up with ran around. I am very upset with them for ignoring me. Gotten me so sick and HOSPITALIZE  ignoring to complete the investigation  this place should be shut down! All I want is an apologies from the restaurant  that's all! They couldn't do that!
Kristina C.,Kihei  HI,36,204,24,5/29/2008,3.0,This place gets a star for the pizzookie alone! Me and my bud ate the apple crisp....glaachachaaha. That's what it made me say.There was a pretty good lunch special too. Had half a sandwich  soup  and fries. And the service was prompt.This place loses a star because it smelled like old sponge.....
Jenny W.,San Francisco  CA,143,190,138,4/29/2009,4.0,I come here for the happy hour  otherwise it's just not worth it!I like the mini pizzas yummy! It's $2 off appetizers  the avocado eggrolls are ok  but it tastes better a Cheesecake facory.$5 mini pizzas rule  I always get the great white with ham instead of chicken  it floats my boat =)The buffalo wings are ok too  so is the artichoke dip.I go here every couple of weeks  I like the pizza here better than pirro's. The pizooki is yummay! I can eat most of it by myself haha =D
Yanni Z.,Daly City  CA,0,6,,1/16/2012,1.0,Well  the reason I gave this place a 1 star because I got food poisoned by their food. I ate burger pizza  spegghi. Mostly I believe it's their can tomato coz both of them have tomato. I felt dizzy and throwed up later. Headache whole day the next day.
Mike C.,San Bruno  CA,232,228,2,5/15/2010,1.0,wait time for a table is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! the service is friendly  but inconsistent at best  depending who you get and how crowded the restaurant is overall  which means it's usually below average. prices are more expensive than your average chain restaurant  but they do offer more variety off their menu. love the decor (including all the TVs and lengthy bar)  location at Tanforan Mall and pretty noisy. the food... well  it's rich  heavy and over-seasoned. however  they do give big portions... once your food ACTUALLY arrives. consequently  i haven't been there in quite some time. i recommend just going across the street to Red Robin.
LovesToEat S.,San Francisco  CA,0,55,,11/8/2011,1.0,I don't know what it is about this restaurant as a whole  but the service all the way down to the chefs who cook  really show that they don't care about their work. They are only there for their own benefit which is...*it's only a job that pays my bills*. Come on...we're pretty much all in that situation  and this specific restaurant brings down the BJ reputation.I'm not gonna trash talk the bad experiences I've had at this specific restaurant  but I'll tell you this. I would ONLY EAT at this restaurant if someone Paid me.The only item I'll eat that I KNOW they can't mess up on is their pizookie.
Naji E.,Millbrae  CA,11,122,17,7/1/2010,1.0,Worst experience I've had my last visit. My cousin and I get there 40 minuted before last call for food. The only seating was in the bar area. My cuz and I sat down and no one came to help us...I grabbed the waitress and asked for service....she replies....oh you guys are new?  It takes her forever to come back with menus.  They come back finally  get our drink orders...run off...the rest of our friends arrive and they give us more menus.....they disappear for a few minutes....I grab another waitor and he says...SORRY...our kitchen closed 5 minutes ago....when I saw our waitress again and asked her what happened...she pretty much ran away. I came to later find out that she and a female at our table had personal issues and that is why she avoided our table. THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!
ally o.,San Francisco  CA,12,165,3,3/12/2010,1.0,i don't know what was up with our waiter when i went. he spent more time trying to flirt with the ladies than wait on tables. i happened to be here in a group of four (two couples) and it took close to half an hour before our waiter picked up our check that was ready to be paid for. there happened to be a table of ladies next to us who were tended to for a good 15 minutes. it was as if the waiter was expecting to get laid that very second. to top that off  he was also trying to holler at his female co-workers with shoulder massages while they had no choice but to endure it as they were cornered while ringing up bills for their tables at the register. those poor female employees. subjected to his touchy feel-y antics while at work. hey waiter named EDWIN O. - you have NO GAME. females talk to you because they want to ORDER food. i unfortunately witnessed it the entire time i was there while you chased after ladies pathetically.i'm sure the manager of bj's brewery enjoyed my table lamenting about the horrible service and how his employees should be re-trained and/or demoted to another position.
Hiromi N.,San Francisco  CA,425,980,199,7/10/2008,3.0,Okay  this isn't my first choice of places to eat  but it definitely is not last. When in a pinch and running errands during my lunch hour at work  the proximity to Target  Petco and Ulta pretty much seals the deal for me.I've been here twice for lunch and I think that it is a-ok. There is air-conditioning  which made dining there quite pleasant during our Bay Area heat wave.Here is what I ordered:ANGUS ROAST BEEF DIP au jus sandwich - $9.30HOUSE CEASAR SALAD - $2.95The roast beef was SUCCULENT and practically melted in my mouth and I LOVE the creamy horseradish sauce. Plus  the seasoned fries are da bomb (they are steak fries) and the thin  crispy fries are also very tasty.All in all  I was pleased and would go there again.
Leslie K.,San Francisco  CA,222,102,4,3/31/2010,2.0,"I\'ve had my BJ\'s cherry popped at this location and like many people and their first time  it could be looked back on as an unpleasant experience.The first time it was a crowded afternoon and of course  I didn\'t mind waiting for a table because it is expected of popular chain restaurants like these. My friends and I were finally seated and more than ready to order. Our server comes and he looks less than enthusiastic to serve us. We\'re an understanding bunch and we know that it was probably an overwhelming day for all the servers  but would it hurt to not look like you just want to get the hell out of there? Anyway  we ordered some fries  honey chicken salad  a pizookie and consulted him about one of the dishes on the menu because my friend  who has zero tolerance for anything spicy  asks him about a dish and how spicy it is. He says that it\'s not spicy at all and of course  we trusted the guy.The time comes for our dishes which were to say the least alright. I\'ll admit  I had high expectations for a place this popular but I would compare my chicken salad to something I would get at Applebee\'s. Not that great. My friend gets her appetizer that is supposedly not spicy. She tried it and her face dropped. The appetizer wasn\'t as mild as we were told. I tried it as well and I love spicy food  so when I tasted it I knew my friend couldn\'t handle it at all. Strike two against the server. I think the only redeeming quality of our meal was the pizookie which you can\'t really mess up. After we were done with our meal  it took forever for our server to come back to us with the check. We paid and I thought that the first time shouldn\'t make me hate the place. But the second time I came back to this establishment  they did not redeem themselves.The second time I went here was for my roommate\'s birthday. We were a huge party of 14 and they had reservations for us. It took awhile for us to get seated. Understandable. Until we realized the place was slightly more empty than expected and there were a couple tables available. Then we were finally seated and lo and behold  the same server from the first time I came to BJ\'s is serving us. He took our orders  which most of us had the same choice (Chicken parmesan) and my friend and I had the chicken fried steak. After some waiting  all of us got our orders at the same time. All of us except me. I thought  oh okay  it\'s a steak  maybe it\'s taking a little longer than usual. Then I notice oe of the food servers was looking over our table and noticed my ""WTF where the f*** is my order?"" look. Our main server comes over and asks what I ordered. ""Chicken fried steak."" ""Oh  okay. *has an OH SHIT look on his face*"". So it turns out that he didn\'t write down my order. Okay  so you wrote down 1 chicken fried steak even though we specifically ordered 2? Wow. Awesome. He asks if I would like a soup or salad while I\'m waiting. And pay for an additional order while I should be enjoying my main dish? Thanks  but I\'ll pass. So my order comes in  fresh off the grill and I can tell it was made in panic. At that point I was pissed off and didn\'t really enjoy my meal. I ate most of it because I was hungry and saved my appetite for that night. We got our checks and he had this idea to split the checks into 2 separate tables in order for it to be easier for us to pay. Also  that DOUBLED the gratuity for himself. Smooth move. I was just glad to get out of there and go home after that.Needless to say  that was the second and definitely the LAST time I\'ll ever go to that BJ\'s."
Karen K.,San Francisco  CA,430,215,1,2/20/2008,2.0,Uh I went to BJ's expecting a good time and when I got there I realized it was a restaurant? Mutha...The only good thing about this place is the name.EDIT: this was written by my friend Jeanette C. when I wusn't lookin' earlier on dis fairest of eves:( I'll keep it here in memory of our new rattails...
Conchita B.,San Francisco  CA,174,161,1,1/19/2009,4.0,Great place to hang out with friends on a Friday night. I only suggest that you get the basic things on the menu.Wings: AWWW so mouth filling these are better than Hooters.Baked Potato: Im truly a fan of it the regular cheese  bacon and sour cream. The potato is like on steriod or something it huge!Avocado Egg Roll: Hell YAH! the sauce is really good with these!Pizza: They have a good selection of them  I have tasted the great white and its good enough.As much as possible get the appetizers cause I think its the only thing you will not regret.I'll have to take one star off just cause its always busy here and the wait for tables are pretty crazy. There are times when they tell you the wait for a table for 2 is like 45 mins  1 hours 15mins and some other crazy wait times.
Teresa Y.,San Francisco  CA,147,647,33,4/10/2008,3.0,Three stars for happy hour and the SECOND server we had tonight. Thanks Sergio! He was our second server. VERY attentive.No stars for the rude FIRST server who barely come to check on us. She helped her friends first! BOO!Sad face for the Warriors' loss. =(
Tiffany Y.,Sacramento  CA,144,248,138,12/31/2010,3.0,It was my first time coming here tonight. 25 - 30 minute wait. Wasn't so bad. I came here with my cousin. After we got seated  no one came and asked what we wanted to drink for 20 minutes. Pretty annoying. Food came fast. Got the cookies and cream Pizookies. It was delicious. But really sweet. After we got the check  they didn't take it for at least 45 minutes. So we were just sitting there talking. We had to hand our check to the waiter. Pretty annoying. Definitely would NOT come here for service. One of the worst service place I've ever been to. Food here is mediocre. Wouldn't be coming here anytime soon.
Steph W.,Los Angeles  CA,234,128,,10/25/2008,4.0,Mouth..drools..for..PIZOOKIE. Okay  have to save the best for last. Must resist from writing a paper on the wonders of the pizookie. I've gone here a couple of times and I tend to always order the scampi pasta. I adore the bread crumbs they put on it and there's not that much sauce. Just the way I like it. And the noodles are thin and easily wrap around your fork. I've also had the grilled chicken pasta but the chicken is a bit dry for my taste. Appetizers I've ordered are the chicken wings  mm mm good! Avocado wraps and the bruschetta were yummy too  but oh my god the deep dish pizza. To die for. I think that's the best pizza I've ever had. Beats Pizza Hut by a mile. Soft  fluffy  god goodness in a dish. Okay  PIZOOKIE TIME. No matter how full I am  I always leave room for this gooey heaven. The chocolate is warm and soft and the vanilla ice cream just tops it off. Cold and warm mixed together. Can't go wrong. You have to  have to order it every time you come here. Good service & athletic feel with all the sports games playing.
John H.,San Francisco  CA,153,51,1,12/29/2011,3.0,Bjs has great food  and a great ambiance...here are the only issues I have...they always ask how I would like my burger cooked....yet EVERY single time it is cooked inccorectly...I dont mind and assume they will cook it incorrectly..but why even ask? its a slap in the face to ask and then do it wrong...mine as well just cook everyones medium or medium well....with that said  I frequent this location often and will continue no matter how annoying the servers are...i realize it is a chain and servers are required to upsell upsell upsell  but it gets sooooo annoying...if i want avocado eggrolls I will order them! :P all in all food is still great...but dont even bother asking how I want my burger cooked......
Lynn V.,Sunnyvale  CA,1,13,1,9/20/2010,4.0,Love BJ's in Tanforan Mall! Fast service  friendly staff  and good food!
Marie L.,South San Francisco  CA,0,63,7,8/21/2011,4.0,If you order take out DO NOT ORDER ONLINE. Apparently the screen cuts off the order so its always wrong  make sure to call. I do enjoy the pizza  calzones  and the Southwest Salad  I think they took my favorite salad off the menu recently. Food can be greasy at times  but goes well with the beer. The desserts are great!
Christina D.,San Francisco  CA,13,45,,5/31/2008,4.0,Let's be fair  while you might always have to wait for hours on weekends to get a seat at BJ's (in our case  the server told us THREE hours for a table of 8)  which chain restaurant doesn't? We don't go to chains for top notch service  we go because when you don't feel adventurous to try a new place  you always know what you're getting here. BJ's is one of my TOP TOP favorite chain restaurants. Good atmosphere  awesome beer & drinks  and even better food. I LOVE their deep dish pizza: order the works or BBQ chicken and you won't be sorry. The crust is so moist and soft  and the stuff on top complements each other perfectly. I'd take that over many sworn by pizza joints in SF like Amici's anyday. The best way to enjoy this place is to go with a group of 4-5  find a seat at the bar area so you can avoid the hour long wait of the restaurant  and share a pizza with several appetizers follow by the famous pazookie. The appetizer that I absolutely love is the chicken wings  comes with 8-10 wings drizzled in ranch and hot sauce; crispy hot and juicy  yum!. The pazookie never intrigued me as much  but you should give it a try. C'mon  we can all ovenbake a cookie and top it with some ice cream  doesn't take a genius to make. Lastly  they have a great happy hour from 3-7p M-Thur. 1/2 off on mini pizzas  and some discounts on appetizers and beer.
Edward B.,Metairie  LA,399,55,68,12/21/2010,3.0,"stopped here for a quick bite before taking a redeye from SFO to ATL. Had the ""classic combo"" pizza and a couple of porters. Pizza was good  beer was good. The place was packed  so I was at one of those extended bar sections. I\'d go back another time."
Wenn C.,San Francisco  CA,115,157,24,1/5/2009,4.0,All I ever get here is the amazing grilled salmon caesar salad. It is amazing the salmon is grilled well  is very tender and flavorful  the greens are always fresh and the super croutons are delicious.Mind you I am VERY picky about how my salmon  or any fish for that matter  is cooked  and this place knows how to cook it.
hime s.,San Francisco  CA,0,17,,12/17/2009,4.0,1 star for refillable good strawberry lemonade1 star for good service1 star for restaurant appearance1 star for the yummy cookie cake w/ ice cream they give you if it is your birthdaytypical american restaurant..overall good food but i did not like the spring rolls..there is some kind of curry taste to it..not sure how to describe it. Everything else was good.ordered pizza  fettucine alfredo  steak and mash potatoes  hot potato  artichoke and spinach dip  avocado rolls..
Deborah A.,San Francisco  CA,0,5,,12/15/2011,2.0,"1st and foremost the service SUCKS!!!! So I came here for my brothers birthday with my family. The wait was about 25min it looked busy but for 25min. why not wait. Anyways after we were sat we waited about 15min for the waitress to come. Finally the waitress came  introduced herself took our drink orders  went to get our drinks came back took our order and everything was fine until she let us know she was going to go on her break. Well  she went on her break and the server that was suppose to take over never came to introduced herself or anything! Plus she had a horrible attitude prob. All she did was drop off our food and walked away never came back to check on us not once! 15min. went by and still no one came to check if we were ok or if we needed any refills etc. When my father wanted to order another beer and I wanted to ask for a glass of water we waited until one of the servers walked by and actually paid attention to us to actually help us. 20min after we had already finished with dinner the server came to the table dropped the check didn\'t say anything and walked off! Didn\'t ask if we wanted dessert or anything just dropped the check off and walked off with a stupid bitter look on her face! At this point I was upset and mind you I am server myself and I understand that when you\'re busy  you\'re busy but at least ask one of your coworkers to check on your table if you cant. I went to talk to the manager and explained to him what had happened and that was a mistake. When I told him that I understood the restaurant was busy his response was ""we\'re not even busy it\'s pretty slow"" needless to say I became livid!!! If its not slow then why the f*ck is the service so shitty???? He offered to discount the bill but at this point I just wanted to leave and did not want to wait another 30 minutes for my bill. I just wanted to get the f*ck out of there and go home. He ended up discounting the bill. The server was lucky I left a damn tip but I wasn\'t going leave without A.writing on the check how much she f*cking sucked so she can read it and B. telling her to her face that she fucking sucked and that she was lucky i still left her a f*cking tip. 15% grat too!! Never again will i come back! food was decent service was SHIT!!!! 2stars only because the food was decent."
Mike A.,San Francisco  CA,3,83,,8/17/2010,5.0,"Ok first of all the host told me the table for our party wouldn\'t be available for another 20-30 minutes so I walked back to my family waiting outside and discussed it with them and they said just tell them we\'re in a rush; let\'s just go to Chili\'s. As soon as I go back to tell them to just cancel our party the host tells me a table has suddenly become available. That is very good customer service if you ask me and an awesome way to keep guests from leaving. Second of all we\'re Thai and there was nothing Thai about the ""Thai style shrimp lettuce wrap""  appetizer we ordered  plus it only came with 4 wraps...our party had 5 people including me. On the contrary the other appetizer we ordered which were the buffalo wings had a nice crisp and I found it hard to keep myself from pigging out on them so I could save room for my entree.. good sized juicy pieces too if I might add  not small and shriveled. Third of all the entree I ordered gave me the choice of either salad or soup  I opted for the salad...nothing special but the portion was ridiculously huge (ok overexagerating but it wasn\'t small)  definately not your appetizer sized salad here. Now onto the steak (my entree)...omfg it was so good  dry aged (supposedly) and cooked perfectly medium rare just how I like it. You\'d be suprised how many places that get this packed end up messing up how well you want your steak. Better than Outback\'s if you ask me which is funny considering Outback is supposed to be a ""steakhouse"". And like the salad  the size of the baked potato it came with was f*ckin ridiculous  I\'ve never eaten anywhere ever that gives you a baked potato that big...it was bigger than the size of my fist! (that\'s what she said).Last but not least....my family are probably one of the most irritating people to deal with but the server was incredibly patient with us. 2 thumbs up to her and the host for the good customer service. BJ\'s wins on all counts in my book  EXCEPT for that terrible ""Thai style shrimp lettuce wrap"".... I mean common guys seriously if you can\'t do it right don\'t do it at all."
Jessica T.,South San Francisco  CA,1,73,1,10/4/2011,4.0,This place isn't bad. In the last maybe 2-3 years that I been coming here  they only messed up our meal TWICE. One time was that they got one of my dad's meals wrong so they had to completely redo it and the manager didn't charge us. The other time was because they accidentally gave our pizza to another table so when we told the waiter  he told us what happened and got to work making another one  again the manager didn't charge us. How lovely!For beginnings  I don't think you can go wrong with the spinach and artichoke dip. Just think about it. Colorful tortilla chips dipped in a warm cheesy dip. Oh man. It even smells good  too! Lol. Or you can order the Best Beginnings sampler platter that has a little of about 4 different dishes. Their strawberry lemonade isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Sometimes it's not sweet enough and other times it's a little too sour. :[For a meal  I usually order the grilled chicken pasta. It's good! BUT again  sometimes there's too much sauce and other times there's not enough sauce. I guess it depends on the chef's mood? If he wants to be generous or not.. But all in all  BJ's is a nice place to be with family. Or friends. But if you come here on a day where there's a major sports game going on  well.. good luck finding seats. And good luck hearing your friends talk cause it would just be way too loud!
kaitlyn s.,Millbrae  CA,1,7,3,9/20/2013,1.0,"I come to this restaurant once a week. Every time Ive came it takes on average 15 minutes just to get greeted by a server and when the server finally arrives none of them seem the least bit happy to serve you. (Based on my prior experience I would give this place one star) Until one night Stewart served me and he changed my entire mind around about this restaurant. He\'s always in a great mood  and knows everything I need before I even ask!! I made a yelp just to write this review on what excellent service he provides. Tonight I came in and didn\'t seat in Stewarts section so I expected to wait 15min before getting greeted (which I did) and eventually I asked a server ""Do you know who the server is for this section? I\'ve been waiting for a while."" Vlattamier replied saying ""Either you wait to be seated or wait for your server  that\'s how it works here. He will come around  just wait!"" I was so upset! Moments later Stewart came over with water and said he can be my server. Even though I wasn\'t in his section. (Which he\'s done multiple other times) From that moment I realized I\'d never come again unless Stewart is there to help me! So I give BJ\'s a one star and Stewart 5!"
Jonas E.,,75,80,,12/19/2008,3.0,Bj's is a good place to get a brew and some food. We came at the right time I guess around noon and sat around the bar area thinking that we were going to get prompt service. I'm guessing they were short staffed for the day but nonetheless the service was really bad the day I went there with friends and never waited that long for appetizer meals.  Besides the bad service  I got their light blond beer that almost tastes like stella but more crisp and to top it off  I order chicken tenders with wedges when before the waiter gave me sliders so I had to promptly flag the waiter down and inform him not to include this on the bill. In the future I will probably come back here and try some other item but hopefully when I come back  service better be great.
Tiffani D.,San Ramon  CA,59,7,,9/25/2009,4.0,BJ's is definitely a place friends and I go to a lot! The prices are good  food is great  unfortunately the service is slow! But that gives you all the more time to enjoy a relaxing meal. Don't go here if you are in a hurry to eat! But if you don't mind a wait to sit- walk around the mall! The pizookie's are amazing (and free for your bday!!) the avocado egg rolls are to die for! Go during happy hour (great times that happy hour occurs) for great deals! Enjoy!
Tracy A.,San Francisco  CA,280,324,144,4/25/2008,2.0,I'll only come here if I know I won't have to wait for seating. Last time I went with a group of 9 and the host told me he had to get the manager out for the reservation. wth? you can't put our names down yourself? you need the manager? what? His manager came out but he didn't talk to us at all. The host told me it will be a 3 hour wait. Are you freakin' kidding me? It's 5pm for God's sake. Other than that the food here is just OKAY. I rather pick Elephant Bar than here. I only come in if there's no line or if I'm starving in the mall. Other than that you won't find me here.
Kenny C.,Oakland  CA,28,223,45,1/20/2009,2.0,Service was HORRIBLE! I have been to a few other BJ's prior and I always had a great experience but not this time. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed  which I expected so we decided to sit outside instead of wait 2 hours for a table. As we sat ourselves outside  we waited 10-15 prior to a waitress even acknowledging our presence. After she was kind enough to find time to tend to our party  we ordered and for it to be so busy the food came out very quickly. When I placed my order I asked for a side of ranch and BBQ sauce and she completely forget  I asked her 4 times before she finally brought it. Also I had to ask another waitress to bring my drink because our waitress also forgot about that. After we ate and divided up the bill we paid  and decided to leave a cash tip even though the service was bad. She noticed that no tip was added on the card and kindly told us we only gave her enough money to cover the bill  even though we left her a generous cash tip on the table. Needless to say we took back a few bucks after this. So my overall experience here was not good. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.
Ruben P.,Daly City  CA,178,166,104,11/22/2008,3.0,"I\'ve been here many times before for happy hour (after work and late night) and always had a good time.The last few times I went here I actually got a table to eat something other than apps. The service is always generally good and the food is good. This past week I went to dinner and got a ton of food with my homegirl.We ordered the ""best beginnings"" appetizer to start off which was a decent sampler platter. Nothing great  nothing really that bad. My friend got the parmesan chicken for dinner which looked good and she seemed to like. I ordered the ribs and chicken combo  which came with a soup. The clam chowder here was actually very good. I was surprised. The ribs were decent and the chicken was okay. We ended our meal with a black/white pizookie. All of the food was good  not exceptional.I would have rated them a 3.5  but will round down because they were out of Hefeweizen when we went for dinner. How the F do you run out of Hefeweizen on a Monday night? There\'s football on! Shame on you BJ\'s!"
Evelyn L.,San Bruno  CA,7,13,2,9/13/2013,2.0,Food is good but the reason the 2 star that the service sucked! Well maybe it was our service....she was horrible! She asked other people if they needed anything but us! So if u happen to be at the booth near the window on a Wednesday night and its a girl with a pony tail..asked to be re-seated!
rhonda s.,South San Francisco  CA,42,268,383,4/8/2009,3.0,If you can't get here early  stay at home or go somewhere else. The reservations 'policy' is bizarre...you can only get your name on a waiting list even if you call ahead. Happy Hour specials are great  if you can get a seat--we've had to stand numerous times. When the stars have actually aligned  we've had some great burgers/beers on the outdoor patio (with heatlamps). Wish they'd move to an online reservation system so that it's a not a total production every time you want to eat here.
Charlie W.,Oakland  CA,63,152,93,1/8/2009,3.0,It's a typical brewery. Nothing too special. Nice selection of beer. Bar drinks are a bit weak. Foods are ok. But nothing you can't have anywhere else. The pizza is their speciality and the deepdish are pretty good if you are into those kinda stuff. BJ Special.. not bad.. service is good.. very nice servers. I will go back again.. Good place to watch the games or a night out with friends... The environment allows you to be loud and cheer for your favorite teams.
Kim D.,San Jose  CA,480,603,6,3/3/2008,1.0,I went here on a busy Saturday night.The restaurant itself had a long wait  the food is all that average.But what really it was - was that the waitress was rude after we scrambled to find a seat on the patio and didn't even knowledge our existence after 10 minutes.She even snapped at us.And it's the kind of situation where you wonder if you should leave because the experience will probably be shitty on out  or she will do her employment justice and turn our perception around.We didn't have that much faith.And to that we left.So for much for an excellent BJ.
Sanfranlifer B.,San Francisco  CA,0,6,,11/9/2011,4.0,A fun place to watch the football games. A lot of TVs around the bar and restaurant. Beer sampler is not your average beer sampler  no short shot glasses here! Had the Pumpkin Ale on my most recent visit  very good! I agree with other posters about the inconsistent service and long waits which is why I gave it 4 stars.
Dennis A.,San Jose  CA,191,64,19,1/3/2011,3.0,Get the ahi poke!! This location is very busy..took a while to get seated and to order. We were Hella hungry!
Lauren L.,San Francisco  CA,31,69,15,8/20/2010,3.0,So my experience coming to BJ's wasn't ideal  I came here with my FATHER and a couple of friends. It wasn't awkward. AT ALL. There was a half an hour wait which was dandy because sitting in silence on a bench with my dad and my friends was pure bliss. Fast forward to ordering our food  no one ordered a deep dish pizza which was kind of surprising. I ordered one of their pasta dishes with shrimp and it was rich. Really rich. I felt like making it rain in the club. I didn't finish my meal because there was a lot of pasta. But when I got home  oh my goodness  I had a really bad stomach ache. If I ever go back  I am not ordering a pasta dish. Unless I want my bowels to be emptied.
Dave S.,Huntington Beach  CA,1,200,,3/28/2011,3.0,5:30 on a Sunday and we have to wait 15 minutes? Holy crap  is there NOTHING else to eat around here? Umm  don't answer that. Look  I found the place by accident and it was better than my other alternatives.It's BJ's. It is what it is...but to wait at 5:30 on a Sunday?
Sheree A.,San Francisco  CA,77,118,8,3/24/2011,4.0,I love the clam chicken wings here and the Pirana Pale ale  nothing beats a long day of work like some Chicken wings and a nice COLD beer! Its also a great place to watch sports. The service is also better than at Hooters which also has chicken wings and beer  but the girls always have a bad attitude!
Jess H.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,,3/20/2010,1.0,"I\'ve been to BJ\'s plenty of times in years past  but last weekend it was absolutely horrific.It was my friend\'s birthday  and we decided to take a little break from shopping. We stopped by BJ\'s for lunch/supper (Lupper?). Anyways  we ordered our favorites: Potato Skins  Sliders  Pasta  and Pizza. First off  the potato skins were dripping in oil  and cold by the time it reached our table! Half of them didn\'t even have bacon on it. Then  when the sliders came  the bun was doughy and the patty was hard. My friend\'s pasta was bland and ""tasted like oil."" And not to mention the pizza was painfully plain.This is the last time I am EVER eating at BJ\'s."
Lileth M.,San Francisco  CA,0,59,,3/18/2010,2.0,"I have been to BJs numerous times especially when we want something fast  good for large number of people  celebrating a low key family gathering - mind you my family is not small - immediate family is 18 ppl from parents to grandkids - let\'s not forget our extended family! Whew - tired already!Anyway  I stopped going to this location just because the management service I received on Father\'s Day in 2009 is lowsy. Yes  it\'s been a long time and I am finally writing about it. The reason I called is because of the Mother\'s Day experience we had. We waited over an hour for a large group. While seated  one of the server told us that they were taking reservations - we were not aware that there was a policy in place.So I decided to call ahead of time and spoke to one of manager named Peter  and asked him whether we have to make a reservation ahead of time. The manager is not aware of the policy so he put me on hold  waited for 5 minutes and he came back on the phone and told me ""NO."" I reiterated 3x that I want to make sure that we are not going to have any problems come Father\'s day and said we should not.So on the day of  I came in really early and the hostess told me that we have to wait over two hours and we have to talk to a manager. I spoke to Mario one of the MOD and he told me that they have been taking reservation for over a week now. Mind you  there was lady standing next to me hearing the same thing. By this time - I was livid! I walked outside to talk to my sister about the reservation  and while talking to my sister  I saw him seat the lady who was standing next to me - the party of 13.While having the conversation with Mario  I explained to Mario that I work in a fine dining restaurant here in the city and we don\'t have this type of problem - not communicating nor getting a memo about taking reservations on large parties especially when it\'s Mother\'s Day  Father\'s Day or any holiday. Every restaurant especially a chain have a policy in place and to make excuses for a manager who\'s been for three years is not a good excuse. P.s. Mario quoted me a two hour wait.We called the other BJs located in San Mateo and quoted us a 15-30 minute wait. We made our reservation  drove to San Mateo and texted my family about the change. I would give the BJs in San Mateo a 4 star  partly because of food but how they handled our situation!This place rocked! Better service and we were seated right away  the MOD/Proprietor was fantastic! The only reason we had to wait is because they want all of us to be there - I did not mind at all - we were all there within 10 minutes - traffic coming from San Bruno to San Mateo. P.s.  I emailed and complained about the service and yes  I received an email from the District Manager and said that he\'s going to talk to his manager. Whether it changed or not - I still do not know. Living here in the Bay Area gives us a lot of opportunities to go and eat in a lot of fantastic places from taco trucks  whole in the wall places to fine dining - from $ - $$$$ - I\'ve experienced it. Yes  I have been to Aqua  Silks  Masa\'s  and more."
Roni R.,Los Angeles  CA,159,369,,4/30/2008,4.0,"I love beer tasting and BJ\'s provided that fix. I felt like I was in a northwest pub w/all the taste of ""malt beer"" and ""red beer"" and crap ... just a less pretentious wine tasting up in the Bay. They keep it real here and that is what I\'m about ... also  that deep dish pizza does kick some ass. Yum! It\'s a stretch from SF where I lived but well worth the metro ride for a night out of the city. :-)"
Jen P.,San Francisco  CA,59,372,453,11/9/2008,2.0,Came here with my sister last week for a quick bite to eat before shopping and heading to school. We shared a BBQ chicken deep dish pizza. It took 15 minutes to cook. Our waiter  Paul  barely tended to us  took us a while before we could catch his attention. I do not see myself coming back here.
Emma R.,Daly City  CA,367,32,18,5/26/2008,2.0,The first time I ate here was with Patrick and the food wasn't that bad but after eating here several times the service just sucks.. The wait just to sit can be up to an hour or two  and I don't really wanna wait that long just to eat  might as well eat somewhere else.I ordered some food there last night for Take out and the service was also bad   yeah they gave me my food but I I told the cashier that there was no one helping me at the bar and I asked the cashier if she can get me a Virgin Pina Colada to go she said she would have to put it on a separate tab but never rung me up for the drink. So I just went back to the bar and I asked the Bar Tender EXCUSE ME! CAN I GET SOME HELP HERE PLEASE! I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 10 MINUTES AND NOT ONCE HAVE I GOTTEN ANY HELP! and the bar tender just looked at me and said to me OK and didn't even say sorry for the wait.I would have given this place a three but just getting bad service from BJ's I gave them a two star for shitty service.
Annette Y.,San Francisco  CA,91,9,39,2/22/2012,3.0,Came here Sunday evening  about half an hour+ wait and ordered the roasted turkey cobb sandwich with wedge cut fries and a root beer. The root beer was a bit flat to start and the fries were yummy but some of them were kinda hard to chew? The sandwich was delicious UNTIL I got to my second half and WTF.. Is that PLASTIC in my sandwich?!! I pulled it out of my mouth and the turkey was stuck to the plastic. (apparently the turkey comes wrapped in plastic) i told the waiter  he apologized and alerted the manager who then also apologized and said it will be taken off the bill. Anything else they can get me? Uh.. No thanks! 3 stars because before the plastic the sandwich was actually good plus the way they handled it.. I guess I should credit them for that.. Yay for customer service! I would probably go back again.. I'm sure this was just a one time mishap...
Valerie N.,San Francisco  CA,27,612,41,3/3/2011,4.0,came with my girl friend and her brother for lunch. we got seated right away. i got their handbreaded chicken parmigiana and gourmet mac n cheese. girl friend got cuban burger and mozzarella sticks. the little brother got the mini burgers and happy fries (i thought it was amazingly cute) food came out good. it was tasty! nomnomnomour waitress was alright. overall  i would come back because food here is pretty good!
Toni T.,Pacifica  CA,11,15,,8/1/2013,2.0,Normally I can go to BJ's and count on good food and drinks and decent service  that is if I get there before noon. If I go in at 2:00 PM (as I did today) I get terrible service. It took over an hour just to get a hamburger. I brought my guests from the airport and was very disappointed.
Belinda C.,Daly City  CA,261,639,2713,2/1/2010,3.0,i came here on a friday night with my friend.. parking was of course easy. but i didn't think that i had to wait an hour for a table for two.  but it's ok cuz you can take your buzzer thing and just go to barnes and noble to hang out for awhile.i learned later that you can call ahead of time to reserve a table.. so i guess i learn my lesson. we got out table and it was nice that they gave us a whole booth for 2 people. we orderd the avocado rolls right away cuz we are starving and it came out fast! if you are an avocado fan you will LOVE IT! filled with so much avocado! and they had a sweet dipping sauce that i absolutly loved! our dish was the deep dish pizza. the waitress was nice and told us that if it's jut the two of us we should order a particular size pizza. it came out to be 6 slices total. iwe ordered the MEDITERRANEAN pizza and it turned out pretty good. i feel like like their deep dish pizza more compared to patxi's . i had one slice and i was done.. too full! but of course there room for dessert! pizookie all the way!! i had the cookies and cream pizookie and my friend had the chocolate chip! i think i like the chocolate chip one more because the cookies and cream was chocolate overload. i wished i lived close enough were i can order a pizookie everyday.. not healthy but taste so good!
Jordan A.,San Francisco  CA,37,174,13,4/16/2008,3.0,I've eaten at this location a total of 5 times and 4 out of the 5 times I've had my food come mildly warm. I've had the pot roast  the meatloaf  some chicken dish and a burger all served almost room temperature. jeez! The food itself is pretty good but how about some steam flowing from the meals people! However the Pazookies are damn good. I'd go just to have desert at this place.
Edwin F.,South San Francisco  CA,158,31,3,7/18/2010,2.0,I really Luke the food here but the problem is that it's a crapshoot when it comes to customer service. Sometimes you get less than average customer service then other times you get abysmal customer service. Bottom line: Food = good; customer service = sub par.
Denise B.,San Francisco  CA,553,1403,3,5/8/2008,3.0,Um  not as good as the one in San Diego  or else my taste buds got better.But still satisfactory. The fish tacos were huge  ginormous if you will! But the fish was covered in more of that shredded cabbage mix than I wanted to. In fact for a second I wasn't sure if they had forgotten to put the fried fish in there  since I couldn't see it! On top of that  the spinach artichoke dip thing was good  and the bruschetta wasn't bad either. I didn't get to get the pizooki this time  but if it's anything like the one's I've had in the past  then it's a good thing to order if you like cookies.....
Serena L.,Alameda  CA,498,437,870,7/18/2008,3.0,I enjoy the food here. they serve several flavors of beers  which is cool and they make it in the back of the restaurant. I think the meatloaf is one of my favorites. customer service was decent. this location gets pretty busy  so expect at least an hour wait on the weekends.
Sara M.,Castro Valley  CA,34,89,88,9/27/2010,2.0,I came here for my brothers going away dinner  we had about 10 people at the table  It was late. We had a 45 minute wait and got seated around 10pm or so.The waitress was real perky  but friendly. She took our drink orders which took awhile to get to us  then she took our food order  which also took awhile to get to our table.Mind you  it wasn't that full after 10:30pm  so we wondered why it took so long. She never came around to ask if our food was good or if we needed more drinks  since more then half of us had empty cups. She forgot one of our food orders  and when she brought it out after reminding her about it  it was cold!She then asked if anyone wanted refills on beer and drinks  she took everyone's order and skipped mine  even though my drink was empty before the food arrived. After flagging her down to get my drink in  it then took another 15 mins just to get our drinks  while she came up with the excuse the bar was busyYEAH RIGHT!! we looked behind us and saw the bar was not overcrowded or busy whatsoever  majority of the tables were gone in the restaurant so what was so busy they couldn't get our drinks to us? RIDICULOUS!Other then that the the food was good  but the service sucked!
Eric M.,Manhattan  NY,123,294,37,5/1/2008,2.0,A friend and I came here after seeing Iron Man on her recommendation  not mine. I saw the sign that said 'Chicago Style Pizza' and I was hooked. As a Chicagoan  I long for the stuff and have tried most every place in the Bay Area that serves it (Patxi's  yelp.com/biz/patxis-chic  Zachary's yelp.com/biz/zacharys-ch  and Little Star yelp.com/biz/little-star) and I have pretty lofty standards (Lou Malnati's yelp.com/biz/lou-malnati). I wasn't hoping for much when I came here  seeing that it was a California grown chain restaurant  but I still had a little faith.Unfortunately  I had hoped for too much. The pizza  which is served in a heavy metal pan  looked doomed from the start. First off  the sausage I got on top was little balls of sausage like you see on a Domino's pizza  not the thick hunks that grace a true deep dish pie. Second  I could see the cheese. This sounds trivial  but the cheese (a tangy mixture of cheeses  not the bland stuff on this pie here) should be buried underneath a thick coating of chunky tomato sauce. Instead  there were a small smattering of tomato chunks. Finally  the crust was all wrong  wrong  wrong. Rather than being the buttery goodness  raised at the edges to hold in the overflowing goodness of the thing  it was thick and doughy like an overgrown thin crust.When I finished the pizza  I felt like I had a brick in my belly. I still do.The service was alright  but nothing to write home about. The beer may be good  but I didn't have it. Whatever you do  don't get the pizza!
Jennifer C.,Millbrae  CA,14,8,,3/26/2011,2.0,Bj's is good but i have had experienced better. Especially for birthdays its not the greatest place because their reservation system is like non existent and they make you wait like an hour and an half. So if they could improve that then maybe there would be better experiences.
Jay R.,San Francisco  CA,0,203,,2/6/2011,2.0,01.10.11 with 4 others - ordered a bunch of appetizers to share (nachos  avocado rolls  spinish and artichoke dip  shrimp wraps)2 star for the avocado rolls  the drinks and dessert (pazookie a must try!) minus 2 stars for the really really bad service (if we even got any)minus 1 star for the looong wait!
Alex C.,San Mateo  CA,719,145,30,10/2/2008,2.0,OH BJs BJs....what do I have to say about thou.........honestly not much -_-Been here several times (usually on a whim) and everytime...I find myself very unimpressed. I typically order the pasta here but I'm told the pizza here is delicious. I stopped by again today with a friend and decided to give their hamburgers a go. Ordered the Cheese Melt Sandwich and what I wound up getting was a very oily sandwich stacked high with a ton of onions. EWWW GROSS!I felt my mouth swimming in onions....and I couldn't really take em out without removing all the cheese (which was melted right on top of it).Only time I've ever only finished about half a hamburger and left.And it really didn't help that I had to wait 15mins just to get water.Service is not really friendly either. They barely acknowledge you as they seat you. And seem rather unhappy to have to come back to your table to ask how your food is. At one point  my friend needed some napkins and instead of asking what she needed when  the waitress immediately assumed that she needed ketchup (huh?) and plopped a ketchup bottle on the table and rushed off to the next table.I realize they get busy but geez!
Norma Denisse S.,Mesa  AZ,174,456,293,3/13/2008,3.0,I wasn't expecting much. The place is actually really nice on the inside  they have a bar area and they have TVs on the walls in case you want to watch the game while you eat. They sat us near the kitchen so it was a little noisy. The food was okay  I mean I was expecting a little bit more flavor but the Turkey Cobb Sandwich was like something I could have just made at home. The fries were tasty they were seasoned and crispy. I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade but to be honest it was too sweet  I mean the kind of sweet that makes your stomach hurt plus they put sugar crystals on the rim of the cup.Overall  I think it was okay. It might be a better place for Drinks and Appetizers maybe watch the game.
Danelle F.,San Mateo  CA,4,6,,7/4/2013,1.0,We have never been to Tanforan B.J's location before  only San Mateo. We were seated and our waiter came up and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. My husband ordered a soda and I ordered a water. After we did this he went down 2 tables down from us and was chitchating with some young people who looked to be friends of his. 8 minutes later he dropped off my water and my husbands soda and before my husband could even get a single word out that he would like a straw he was already back at his friends table just talking away. Needless to say we were a bit frustrated but oh well we will just catch him when he comes back to get our orders. When he finally came back he took our order and we figured ok fine. So husband ordered pork chops and I ordered soup. So when waiter came back with food he dropped off food as he walked by. Not even stopping at the table he just kept walking until he got back to friends table. My husband looked down and said where are green beans? and I just shook my head. Meanwhile as waiter just walked past our table and went directly back to friends table at which time he spent 13 min talking to them. Finally we asked another waiter to grab our waiter which he did. The waiter comes back giving us a look like we have inconvenienced him somehow. My husband asks him doesn't this come with green beans and waiter said yes. Husband then asks him well where are they and the waiter looks at my husband and says. They are in the kitchen. At this point we are very angry. As a customer at this establishment I would never have expected such a fresh mouth from a waiter. At this point we asked to speak to his manager and he said ok. 10 min later manager was at our table and we explained what happened. At this point manager took over and took pork chop back and started over. He brought pork chop back with green beans and potatoes but by this time we were just too angry to eat. You would have thought that the manager would have comped at least my husbands meal at least knowing how inappropriate his employee was. But of course he did not. We will NEVER return to this location and probably never back to this establishment because of the kind of service we got today.
Lillian L.,Oakland  CA,80,131,27,7/6/2008,3.0,Coworkers and I frequent this place because it's reasonably close to work and has good happy hour specials. They like the expansive variety of beers on tap (popular among them are the Nutty Brunette  Jeremiah Red  and PM Porter)  and I like that you can get 5 oz. samplers of the beers because I'm a lightweight.What I love most is that you can get Lindemans Framboise here. It's the first beer I've ever enjoyed (introduced to me by the lovely Mr. H)  as I don't much like the taste of beer. It's a raspberry-flavored  fizzy drink that barely tasted alcoholic but definitely felt it when I gulped down half the sampler in a minute. I had to quickly rectify the situation by ordering an appetizer.... which brings me to the cons of the place.Firstly  the food is not great. As in... worse than at a baseball stadium. Everything tastes old and microwaved  except for the pizookie (a big warm cookie with ice cream on top)  which is quite divine. Secondly  the service is sub par  particularly during happy hour. They're slow to serve and hard to hail down when you need anything. Perhaps these things are to be expected at a place like BJ's  and clearly we don't mind the shortcomings too much because you'll see us here on Fridays... and sometimes Thursdays... and maybe Mondays.... We're the group having a good time -- laughing and putting away the beers (with little help from me).
Rebecca S.,Pacifica  CA,5,30,3,3/12/2011,4.0,I dream about their mac and cheese often  but everything I've ever had at BJs has been super tasty. Love the drinks too. I would have given it 5 stars but the wait staff has never really been stellar.
Roy N.,San Francisco  CA,43,243,9,4/24/2010,5.0,went here for lunch  because I really ran out of ideas. i had what was probably the best pizza I've had in a long time! it was crazy. their deep dish is actually pretty damn good. sports bar  yes. but the pizza. man  it was good.
Dani D.,Northern  CA,150,559,,3/4/2008,3.0,BJ's (interesting) Restaurant & Brewery located in the Tanforan Mall next to Barnes & Nobles.Two of us were headed to Barnes & Nobles to purchase some books & movies but decided we were hungry and needed to eat before browsing & purchasing.Intro: BJ's..no high expectations.Just fill us up because we are hungry.It was quite early and not too busy when we entered.We were seated on the opposite side of the bar.it was ok comfortable and told the waitress would arrive shortly.She arrived and was quite nice and I am sorry I forgot her name because she kept checking on us throughout our entire meal here and was professional.First off ofcourse they ask you if you want a beverage..alcohol beverage I didn't induldge in.it would have been nice but I passed.The Espresso-Tini sounded tasty  as well as the others and they had a decent selection of beer.at this moment my focus wasn't on alcohol it was more about getting some good books after some decent food. On to the menu and what we decided:Spinach-Artichoke Dip was very creamy with colorful crispy chips.Let me tell you we eyed the Bruschetta but passed on it.Honestly the dip was nothing fabulous but satisying at the moment to the both of us.My friend decided on the Salmon Fillet w/rice pilaf veggies and salad.He practically finished everything and I decided to go with the Blonde Ale Battered Fish-n-Chips w/ fries.The fish was quite crispy and tasted ok as well as the fries.Nothing extraordinary or over the top of being scrumptious but just fulfulling at the moment.By the time our main dish came out the place was packed.I think maybe because it is in a somewhat busy mall with people shopping that is why most of the people come here.I may be wrong.I must say the waitress was quite attentive.The atmosphere was quiet in the beginning but became busy quickly.Prices ok.Food varies.Parking is so-so.
Chris T.,San Francisco  CA,110,264,22,10/29/2007,1.0,"I usually don\'t review too many chains  but I will only when I had an exceptional experience. Well  at BJ\'s I did. I had an exceptional case of fast acting diarrhea.A friend and I had split a House Salad with some sort of creamed dressing... Bleu I believe it was. Well  after paying for our mediocre greasy food we went to the neighboring mall to shop. It was synced so well  both my friend and I got tummy aches at the same time. So the culprit had to be BJ\'s rotten dressing. Also  when I was sprinkling some pepper onto the same salad  well the lid fell off and I got a big mountain of pepper all over the place! ACHOO! Great! Now I got boogers all over the place! I know they must refill their own salt n pepper jars so did they forget to quality check this one or was this a ""Oh I gotcha this time!!!"" prank? The ol\' loose pepper shaker gag... At least this would have been forgivable.Our waiter seemed really confused on what to do. He was definitely a trainee  but wouldn\'t anyone know what to do with a broken pepper shaker? Toss it  apologize on behalf of the restaurant and help us clean up. He had to summon a supervisor for guidance... dear oh dear.Only good part of this restaurant is that there are about 157 TV screens to watch a sports game."
Ace V.,San Francisco  CA,0,10,,4/16/2011,4.0,They have a huge menu and their deep dish pizza is great. There are many beers on tap to select from. I recommend the Bj's Blond. It goes good with the pizza. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the place gets crowded sometimes and the wait for a table can take a while. Great place though.
BrendaJoy G.,San Francisco  CA,101,67,11,9/6/2010,3.0,I'm surprised I haven't reviewed BJ's yet! I've came here a several times  especially for their Thai lettuce wraps  spinach artichoke dip  flatbread pizza  & Pizzookie. Service here is alright. Friendly but the waiters take a while to come to you. Food takes forever to come out  but it's worth it. Portions are perfect for sharing .. or just for your hungry self. I've had many dishes from the menu & I'm willing to try more.
Peter W.,San Francisco  CA,20,71,28,10/13/2010,3.0,The food here is good  not great  but I've never really been disappointed at anything I've ordered here. (I'd describe this place as a slightly lesser version of Cheesecake Factory... without the cheesecake) For the price and the usual long wait (during busy hours) however  I usually don't bother unless someone I'm with REALLY wants to try this place. The beers are decent  food is decent  both of which I wouldn't exactly drive out of my way for and the single unique thing is the almighty PIZOOKIE. I admit  I love it  but I'd have to really question whether it's worth it for that alone. Plus it's a dessert so not exactly something you'd get with lunch or enjoy with each meal. Unless that's how you roll lol. They do have bar seating so you can grab that if you don't want to wait for a table.
Meredith O.,Menlo Park  CA,67,188,8,11/17/2007,1.0,"It was late last night and we needed food. This place was conveniently located and open. That is where our good luck ended. vaguely similar... to Cheesecake FactoryWe were told it would be a 30 min. wait. After 30 minutes I checked the front desk again. Turns out our name and table had been passed by long ago and our beeper thing did NOT go off. They were apologetic and got us into the very next table. The front desk should get 2 stars for that but...It was another 10 minutes before our waiter showed up at the table (remember it is late  we are very hungry  and we just waited 35 minutes pursing the menu in the waiting area  we know what we want) So we place the order  the music is so loud  we had to review it thrice with the waiter. 1st to arrive at the table = salad (not beverages  nor a fork  knife and table set-up but salad.) 15 minutes (honestly) for the beverages and they were the wrong ones..... and then the pizza.... again there were no plates for the Pizza and we had to wait for those.... but.... the spaghetti was cooked sans the meat balls but it had meat sauce. Now I told the waiter 3 TIMES ""Spaghetti with MEATBALLS"" but with the noise level he could have legitimately heard ""Spaghetti with meat sauce"" excused... I honestly believe our waiter was so fixated on collecting the checks and tips from other tables he forgot service should come before the bill.... and without service  fellow workers are not stealing your tips  people are just not leaving them.One star as the food did not make me sick?!@#!$&%^$*&^%"
JacQue S.,Contra Costa  CA,28,97,24,2/10/2011,3.0,The food is either salty or bland. For the price of food it's not worth it. But love the drinks.
Katherine F.,Seattle  WA,63,375,,6/17/2008,3.0,"This place is just alright. I like the atmosphere and the fact that it stays up until past midnight on a Monday night. I went here with a total of 7 people and we sat into a great booth and most of us ordered different things. The deep dish pizza was good and everything else was pretty tasty. It\'s not anything that\'s ""wow""  but it\'s a great place to hang out late.My only complaint is that that server wasn\'t really that cool and my water cup was definitely empty by the end of the dinner....but I guess what do I expect for a little higher class Red Robin?"
Lynn Y.,Costa Mesa  CA,5,24,10,12/25/2012,4.0,Food was good and our waiter was awesome and so nice on Christmas Eve.
RICHARD W.,San Francisco  CA,379,44,11,2/7/2011,4.0,Great restaurant.. I love Avocado Egg Rolls  Pizza is great.. Always busy with lines but it's not a problem as long as I'm having fun..
Andy S.,San Francisco  CA,27,120,12,9/26/2010,3.0,A relatively dull  corporate brewhouse -- much like a Rock Bottom or similar. Not a bad place for lunch  but definitely not somewhere I would seek out for great California beers.
Shay G.,San Mateo  CA,1,14,,5/25/2013,2.0,So this is my favorite chain  but this location doesn't represent it well. The fries are either super greasy or taste like they've fried fish in the same oil as the French fries  the service is slow (good luck getting your drink refilled quickly...they have a drink station that a specific person does refills for. The wait is ridiculous and the quality of the food/preparation isn't like the BJ's in san mateo. San Mateo's is MUCH better on ALL levels. Sad to say  but its true. I've been to both more than 50 times.
Kurt H.,Normandy Park  WA,3,144,65,3/23/2011,3.0,Good food and beer. Service sucks in the bar. Prices are resonable.
Ari C.,Daly City  CA,169,355,387,8/17/2007,2.0,Under normal situation  I would give BJ's 3 stars because I like their pizza and calzones.So why the two stars? First of all  the waiting sucks. Then the food and drinks are just okay.But the reason they get only 2 stars is because  make sure you make a mental note of this  ONE OF THE WAITERS STOLE MY FIANCE'S AND HIS FRIEND'S CREDIT CARD NUMBERS. Yes  someone who works for BJ's STOLE OUR MONEY. We have no idea who it was and a police report has been filed.I'll still go to BJ's  but I WILL NOT pay with credit/debit card anymore and I suggest you do the same. I realize two stars sound a bit generous considering the crime that took place at that  but it is an isolated incidence and it's not BJ's who stole the money  it's the people to work there. Other than that  BJ's is a decent restaurant.
Stanley K.,San Francisco  CA,710,573,330,8/14/2007,2.0,I am not a fan of slow and poor service. We had no table utensils. We had no one to check up on us  no refreshing of our drinks  no pre-bussing  and one of our orders was not fired. If I had to rate this server  he would be retrained again. I don't understand how you can make money serving unless you give them proper service. I must admit  I am a king  I deserve great service at all time. After all  I will be mayor of San Francisco one day.
Gerardo B.,San Bruno  CA,10,12,,5/15/2013,2.0,It was a hot day so my girlfriend and I decided to grab lunch at BJS. We got outdoor seating and the serves greeted us fast. I order a Mojito and a california club pizza with NO AVOCADO! my girlfriend got the Santa Fe Salad with prawns. Our drink was deliver fast and our food came at the right time about 15 minutes  only one problem  my pizza had avocado. I sent it back and they told me they make me a new one. I think our server realized he had made a mistake so he ignored us for 30 minutes. Our waters were empty and i wanted another drink but the server would just walk by and nothing. After about 30 minutes the manager walked out so i flagged him down and explained our situation  he said he would go check on it. Then finally our server came and i told him what happened  i order another drink and told him to make another salad for my girlfriend as the lettuce was all soggy from the sun. The manager brought me my pizza and it looked good  then i told him i had a drink so he had to go get it as the server didn't go get it. Then i look at my pizza and it looks like they had just wiped off the avocado as i can still see little marks of it  i had not eat 2 pieces. Finally we ate what we could and asked for our bill.The manager was remarkable but the server was awful  and the food time also bad considering it was only a pizza. Never going back
Nancy T.,San Francisco  CA,14,42,1,3/17/2011,3.0,Food was good but service was horrid. We asked what was the wait time  it was an hour which was fine. We were told to come back in 20 minutes for the little beeper thing because they ran out  word? So wait time ended up being a total 1hr 30 min. We had two different waitress  the second one we had to flag down when we needed something even to pay. Three stars for the food and 0 stars for the service.
Danny H.,Sunnyvale  CA,323,251,80,8/26/2007,2.0,"From the parking lot you\'d think ""Tied House"" or ""Gordon Biersch"" or any number of large  clicheed ""brew pub"" restaurants. Once inside I noticed that BJs had the additional cajones to lay claim to Chicago cuisine. OH really? I ordered a mini pan pizza  and was treated to a limp piece of bread with toppings on it  including those disgusting little ""rabbit turd"" sausagelettes you get at Pizza Hut  etc. ""Dormitory pizza bagel"" would have been a more appropriate description.This place sucks."
Barrett H.,Redwood City  CA,1,36,7,3/15/2011,3.0,Had a lot of salad and soup for lunch and they were both mediocre. It's kind of loud but the decor is nice. The waitress was nice and helpful. Yeah the main dishes were pretty good if you are looking for a meal averaging in the low 2000 calories. I don't run enough marathons to deserve to eat at BJ's ...
anne m.,San Francisco  CA,68,176,3,7/9/2010,3.0,This place actually is comparable to the Elephant bar but the one plus is they have outdoor seating. We like to come here when the weather is nice and ask for an outdoor table. Don't expect anything spectacular in the food department-your basic salads  burgers and sammies.
Liz S.,Portland  OR,607,1059,883,1/28/2007,3.0,While it has that kind of TGI Friday's or Chili's vibe  BJ's is definitely a step up from those chains.I was here about a week ago for a work field-trip  and they served our table of 12 people very well. They had the usual array of Big Salads  soups  and overstuffed sandwiches. I found the food to be tasty and of decent quality.I had the clam chowder and the half BBQ Chicken sandwich. The chowder  while very flour-y  was OK  and the sandwich was good. The fries were great.The place is huge and open  with good acoustics. I eyed the big bar on my way out  which looked like a good place for a guy to watch a game while his wife shops at the mall. Good for kids (the restaurant  not the bar).
Christy L.,San Francisco  CA,289,741,33,8/21/2007,3.0,"With a name like BJ\'s  how can you go wrong? Well  like a bad BJ  they leave you with a bad taste in your mouth (yikes  did I really say that?!). 3 stars for the pizza only. The service and everything else - nada!BJ\'s is really strange. I don\'t know if you\'ve ever seen the movie ""Waiting "" but images of that movie totally come to mind when I come here. I can just see the chef in the back surprising the waiter with THE BAT WING - oooohhhhh  it\'s so veeeiiinnnyyyyyy!Anyhooo...I think one of the qualifications you need to work here is the ability to either  1) be totally stoned while working  or 2) just look and act totally stoned while working here. In the case of our waiter for the evening  I really hope he was stoned because if he wasn\'t  I feel sorry for his dumb ass.We typically order the pizza or the calzone. I can\'t say that I\'ve ordered anything else off the menu  aside from the appetizers. I really like the pizza  which is the only reason they get 3 stars. Sweet pig is my favorite. We ordered the chips and salsa for an appetizer - don\'t waste your money...Doritos and store bought salsa are way better. The artichoke dip is usually a safe pick.Of course  the beer makes everything taste better...even makes the shitty service bearable. Don\'t forget to order the Pizzookie  totally yum!"
Amy C.,San Francisco  CA,76,217,85,7/30/2010,4.0,Nice place to have a small to moderate gathering of friends and family. But ideally it would be better for a group up to six max because its inconvenient for larger groups. Good food all around  no complaints. Everything is great!
Quinallison J.,Bay Area,63,148,181,7/29/2008,4.0,"Me? Yelping a chain  no way. Okay okay so I do this only cause this is the place to be sometimes when you need a good chain restaurant to go to and you don\'t want to think about parking  if the food is good  if the place might be dead  too crowded  too overwhelming  yada. Everyone knows the peak hours  everyone knows what they like here. There\'s never anything wrong w/ the food unless it\'s just ""one of those days"" when you\'re the unlucky one  but that barely happens. I love the food  my favorite is the simple classic baked potato  huge and generous with the toppings. My friends and I ALWAYS get the nachos. Even 5 of us have a hard time finishing it off. The beer is always good of course (I\'m a wimp  I like the berry burst cider) and the reason why we always decide to go...PIZOOOKIEEE!"
Evan Y.,San Bruno  CA,235,26,,10/21/2008,5.0,I really love this place. Food is great  service is excellent and not to mention the wide variety of food. I love this place more then E-bar. Despite the long wait for a seat  they have many different kinds of options that you can do. You can call in for a table for 9 or less. You can actually set up a buffet if you have a party of 15 or more. If you do not plan ahead like say 2 days ahead you'd probably end up waiting 2 hours for a big party. Overall  10 or less you should be able to get seated within 1 hour depending on the night. This is the one of the places I am willing to spend $40+ everytime I go there. Great food  if you go and crave for monster dessert cold or warm  buy the Pizookie! Great place for beers  especially if its birthday and you want your friend to get effed up! :]
Michael M.,San Francisco  CA,212,643,258,8/11/2006,3.0,Eh  just OK. It looks like it's better for Happy Hour type stuff anyway. I went there last night after work for some food. I was hungry and didn't want mall food  but Fatt Dog looks interesting.Anyway  they have 162 TV's playing different sports  and I happened to be there on a night when the Giants were off. They have lots of pizza  which it seems like is their specialty  but I didn't see anybody order any. Lots of fried appetizers can be had  and lots of beer. Too bad I am not a beer drinker. So I settled for the BJ Burger with bacon and cheese. The burger was rather small and thin  almost as thick as the thick sliced bacon  which was good! But sad to say  the bacon was better than the burger. The fries are thick and coated with seasoning  but I think just plain old steak fries are better.I added a wedge salad for about $2 more which was pretty good with blue cheese  bacon  tomato and onion. Pastas and other salad items are also available.Looks like a great place for after work  munching on appetizers  drinking beer  and watching sports.Minor Update : I tried the pizza and was REALLY disappointed. I have been spoiled by Little Star. Skip it.
Bonita C.,San Francisco  CA,76,120,32,1/13/2008,4.0,i am never displeased when it comes to eating at BJs. It is a good location from my home and the restaurant is easy to spot...True  the wait is horrible but I've never experienced it since my friends are always the ones who have to do the waiting while I come in later. =) haha. We usually come to BJs for last resort or a semi late dinner. I've gotten a different variety of their foods so far. I love their sesame chicken salad  it is soo damn good. It was so good that I ate all of it last night  which I rarely do when it comes to salad  haha.Anyways  I would definitely come back again once in a while. yum =)
Charisse G.,South San Francisco  CA,26,67,13,9/2/2008,3.0,Good times. I don't care much for the service.Bruchetta = awesomeCrisp Potato Skins = awesomeFries = awesomeChili Cheese Fries = awesomerAvocado Egg Rolls = nastyMozzarella Cheese Sticks = nastyTurkey Cobb Sandwich = awesomeTurkey Club Sandwich = awesomerCookies & Creme Pizookie = yay
Art D.,San Francisco  CA,224,202,2,7/17/2006,3.0,I've been to this BJ's a few times now  and it's been hit and miss.\r The good - I really like their jambalaya  and their beer and cocktails are also pretty good. I've tried their hefeweizen and porter  and liked the hefeweizen better. The porter is a little to sweet for me to enjoy with food  but I'm also a guy who doesn't like to mix his savories and sweets too often.\r The bad - I just tried their deep-dish pizza for the first time  and I think I'm finally getting over the heartburn! The pizza was very buttery and had almost no sauce  and reminded me of Pizzeria Uno's at their worst. This was disappointing  because I had heard good things about their pizza.\r I guess the lesson is to stick to the jambalaya  and head over to Zachary's for my deep-dish (or stuffed) pizza fix!
Jay H.,San Francisco  CA,773,989,21,4/18/2006,1.0,So when you try BJ's at first you are a little apprehensive.  Do you really want to go down that route? I mean BJ's is not that out of the ordinary. The location is pretty damn convenient if you are looking for something to sate the hunger.  At first glance BJ's appears very tame and undaunting. You've seen this environment before...a little different yet still the same. \r So I put in to my mouth what BJ's had to offer and it made me sick. This was NOT what I expected. I mean I didn't expect it to be an amazing experience and I'm not looking for something perfect  but at least a satisfactory experience and possibly one that I may go back to.  No such luck. I left with an uneasy feeling in my stomach thinking that I should have never even gone there. \r Lesson of the Day: Even if you're ravenously hungry...be careful what you put in your mouth.
Molly T.,Oakland  CA,4,10,10,4/27/2011,5.0,This is my all time favorite BJ's around! Why you ask? Well I'll tell you. It was my first BJ experience-which was only just a few weeks ago  sad I know- and I had the best time ever. The wait wasn't that long  just about 20 minutes. Once inside  you're greeted by the best staff ever! My waiter's name was Will that night  a handsome young gentlemen with blonde hair who thankfully assisted me in choosing my meal. It was his favorite  the Chardonnay shrimp pasta  I put all my faith into him and trust me I was not disappointed. Light  creamy and savory  the pasta was like heaven in my mouth. I also had the egg roll appetizer  which my best friend had picked and that was just wonderful!I was not dismayed by any wait time as it was speedy in my eyes and also I was occupied by the games on the various flat screens around the room. Then to top off the night  when I was already a plump marshmallow  dare I say it I had the pizookie. Half chocolate chip and half cookies nd cream(or Oreo I'm not sure what the difference in those terms are). It was the most amazing thing you could ever have in your mouth! I was just in euphoria from all its cookie  ice cream goodness. If you want good  filling food  this is the place to be!Thanks to Will and the Chef's of the night  I will see you guys again soon!
Kathleen M.,San Jose  CA,920,1480,117,9/22/2006,4.0,Yeah  it's a chain  but you know what? The pizza's pretty darn good. A small is enough to feed two people  and you get out of there only paying about $12-$14 total. The plain ol' cheese pizza (with a topping or two thrown on) isn't too shabby. The Chicago special with meatballs and pepperoni and sausage is pretty good for those times you don't mind overdosing on meat.
Gilbert C.,San Francisco  CA,2,190,24,10/9/2008,5.0,Ive gone here to eat a handful of times since they opened the place. The service is usually good and courteous and the food is good and on the bigger portion size. I love their nachos appetizers....its friggin huge! Their desserts like the pazookies are equally awesome....its quite a feat trying to finish it after having one of their big entrees.I'm also very much a sports fan so I love how they have tons of tv screens all showing sports related stuff. They dont turn up the volume so I wish they turned on closed captioning.Never had a problem here at all....except sometimes the waiter/waitress seems to disappear after paying the bill (my friends and I sometimes just like to chill there a bit longer finishing our drinks and BS-ing with one another) but maybe thats just policy.Good for large groups too which is nice.
Bing D.,San Francisco  CA,151,472,65,8/23/2010,4.0,why only 4 stars and not 5?they are slow. i mean slow. the mananger though is a great guy and he noticed that we had been greeted slowly and our orders came slowly too that he offered us a free dessert for 3. we weren't greedy so we just ordered the trio pizookie which is ice cream over a fresh over baked cookie.i ordered the sourdough burger. my father had the teriyaki salmon  i almost got the teriyaki chicken. my mother had the fish n chips.all of it was cooked perfectly. wish we had more. the price could be a bit better but hell its a restaurant that has lots to order from and sometimes it takes some time to get it out to you.i've loved eating here and they have bottom less sodas...but better BOTTOMLESS HOMEMADE ROOTBEER.
David D.,San Francisco  CA,84,328,2,2/8/2010,1.0,"First I would like to state that I\'m a waiter. I know what its like and I know that servers are usually 10x more busy than the costumers think. But there was no excuse for the service myself and my friends received tonight. There were 2 of us at the beginning but we told them it would be 6 total. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to even greet us. Then took another 15 minutes to receive our drinks. But w/e  we\'re not stressing about it. At this point our friend joins us- now there are 3 of us. Another 10 minutes for the waitress to come by and take his drink order- we also order some appitizers at this point. As soon as they came out  our waitress tells us that her shift is over and asked if we could pay our bill  BUT THAT ANOTHER SERVER WOULD BE BY SOON TO TAKE CARE OF US. So of course we pay and wait for another waiter to come by. Now all 6 of us are here and we have not seen our 2nd server for 45 minutes. YES  45 minutes. Not one waiter even looks at us. There are 6 of us at a table eying every server that walks passed and no one awknowleged us. We waved down two waiters  both of which did nothing. They gave us blank stares! ""Can we have a waiter?"" *Blank stare."" So we just got fed up and went to the bar tender who is on the other side of the restaurant to order drinks and food. Not being our server  we tipped him before we even received our food.So for the 3 hours we were in the restaurant  we went 2 hours without a server. And dont think for a minute that I\'m exagerating this at all. All 6 of us  all waiters  said we would have been FIRED if we treated our costumers like we were treated. Imagine being a waiter and not helping a table for 45 minutes. Not to mention that no one even came by to pre-bus our table.The only reason we did not ask to see a manager is because we\'re friends with the manager and did not want to bother him.Oh yeah- the restaurant was only about 1/3rd full."
Courtney D.,San Francisco  CA,183,77,18,2/28/2010,1.0,why! why! why! Do we continue to return to this place is the question  (glutton for punishment I guess) I can promise you it's not for the stellar service  these kids could care less if you ever get your food  that is if they even bother to PUT IN your order! One time the waiter actually came back to clarify what my friend had requested on her pizza  then when all the orders came  hers was missing! I've been here with a large group & small group  either way it takes 45 mins just to get your drink order in  and that's on a good day! So if you have time to kill this is the place to go  the only redeeming quality is the deep dish pizza  when & if they get it right or get it on the table at all!
Carolina H.,San Rafael  CA,69,98,99,8/9/2008,2.0,My boyfriend and I stummbled upon this place while on a shopping excursion. I was looking forward to having a few cocktails before begining my adventure. The only problem at this place is their staff...They straight blow it. Ten minutes before they ackonwledge you and five to take a drink order finally five more to get the drink. I mean look at this place! Great ambiance  plenty of entertainment and your located in a mall. All I wanted was a cocktail. How busy can a full staff be at 11:30am. I gave them two stars for the drinks they tasted great although the wait can be comical. Won't be stopping back here anytime soon.
Marc M.,Redwood City  CA,471,177,,12/16/2012,4.0,Always a great Thursday Happy Hour spot. :)
Spanky M.,San Francisco  CA,1,383,8,11/2/2008,3.0,"Actually 2.5 stars. Nows I know the sandwiches and burgers here are decent  I have had them and they are not anything to write home about but the price and portions are proportional. Also the aqppetizers are good  not anyting mind blowing  but good.However  the PIZZA...what a piece of $HIT! I mean chicago style? Listen just becuase you put your pizza hut crust (literally) into a pan that does not make it Chcago style. I came in hopeing for atleast something better than Pizza hut but was given one of the biggest dissapointments of my life  next to my dissappointment of Zachary\'s ""Chicago style"" pizza. I had to tell the server the pizza was absolute crap as a representatation of my home town. It was basically Foccacia bread with vegetables and frozen meat products drizzled on top with cheese spotted over it.I Are you F\'ing serious with this SORRY excuse for a CHicago style pizza. As a Chicagoan I must say I am truely offended that anyone would even pass this off as Chicago Style. I never even heard of BJ\'s in the Chi. No wonder people here think Zachary\'s is so great  the alternative is unthinkable."
Dave H.,Saint Paul  MN,11,119,,1/16/2008,1.0,It's always packed  I think because it's one of the few places in San Bruno that is both clean and unlikely to result in a mugging. If you work in the office park  there are only so many times that you can eat at the decent Vietnamese place in the shopping center  and as amazing as Don Pico's is  it's too expensive to go there regularly.Location is apparently everything  because there is otherwise absolutely no reason to go here. The service is abysmal; you'll often see 10 empty tables but have to wait 30 minutes to be seated  and when you get a table  it will take your greenhorn waiter 10 minutes to show his face. Once you get your food -- it's laughable. I've had salads with frozen lettuce -- no kidding  practically with ice cubes -- and others with so much dressing that I couldn't see the ingredients.Like all the other suckers  I keep going here just for lack of other choices.
Alicia H.,Daly City  CA,0,1,,6/6/2013,1.0,My son (11yr old) and I walked into BJ's San Bruno today at 1055 am. We were seated a minute later. They had just opened. You would think service and food will come out pretty quickly. Think again. Server Alex took our order 5 minutes later. I ordered unlimited soup and salad  and my son ordered kids meal (ribs). Our food came out 25 minutes later. My soup was warm but I didn't complain. Half way thru my soup  server Alex asked how everything was. I said good  but can I have another bowl of soup (knowing it would probably take a long time to get another one). Soup came out 15 mins later (really ?). There was a couple sitting near us who had complained about there wings not having enough sauce. Alex took it back and it came back with more sauce in less than 2 minutes. Why did they get better service  maybe because their bill would probably be more  meaning more tip for him ??? I have done this job before and yes  unfortunately it does happen like that. The bigger the bill the better your tip will be. Someone else brought the soup. I made the comment about how long it took then asked her if I can have my soup to go. She said yes I can get that for you  but never came back. I sat there for another 5 minutes waiting for Alex to come to my table. He never came back. So I finally waved down a manager  William  I told him all that had happened. He apologized and said he will minus my meal for the inconvenience. I did also tell him that Alex never came back to face me to apologize for anything. That is so freaking frustrating to be ignored when its their job to give you good customer service no matter what you order. This BJ's Restaurant in San Bruno has gone down in service. They have hired people who do not care so why should the paying customers care to come back ???? I even gave him a tip !!! Why did I do that ??? I guess because my son did enjoy his meal. If you decide to come to this BJ's  lets hope you don't get Alex or anyone like him as a server. No personality. This was not my first incident and it wasn't my 2nd. I just thought I give it another shot. Never again !!! I have never yelped before. Like another yelper stated....BJ's was asking for it.
Neil A.,Montara  CA,33,148,2,10/25/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Minus one star for changing reservation policy when they feel like it. Yeah that's right.... BJs is one of those places that refuses to take reservations so when it's busy you just have to get the obligatory vibrator and wait your turn. That's how its always been so that's what you come to expect. I always sit in the bar 'cause that area is first come first serve. Well  when the Giants were playing game 5 of the NL series I decided to head over to BJs early to watch the game only to find reserved tables in the bar.... Total Bullshit to change how things are done for an important game. If I'd known I would have planned accordingly and gone somewhere else. Needless to say I won't be heading over there for any of the World Series and I may just write them off all together.
Jessica R.,San Francisco  CA,105,371,269,10/20/2008,4.0,Went to BJ's last night with the fam. It was all good foooood =) Had to spend time with my cousin who just came back from the Army and she was craving BJ's-- I think she loves this place  haha. BUT  we had a waiter then we got a new one. The one we had the first time took our drink orders and what not. It was funny 'cause my cousin kept calling him SEYMOUR and he was like  that's not my name. It was all fun and games  I had fun but the food took long and since we waited so long  I was no longer that hunger so all of us had to get to-go boxes. Yeah  pretty much. OHHHH  and try their bruschetta-- it's bomb!
G R.,San Francisco  CA,38,297,321,7/23/2007,2.0,Had a craving for nachos and living in the City we don't have many options (I even checked what Yelpers had to say and I am afraid not much help).So after 30mins of searching we decided to go South and hit BJ's. What can I say we were hungry. Its one of those places you may go once a year to; I would never be a regular there.No offense to those who frequent the place (there was a 15 min wait to be seated). But the beer is not that great  the only thing we ordered was the Nachos and they were respectable.Good amount of toppings  cheese well melted  plus it was REAL cheese not that Velveeta oozy stuff.Either we were hungry and ate the whole thing or it was that good; I'd say it was a combination of the two.
Selene K.,San Francisco  CA,338,219,,3/25/2008,4.0,Came here tonight to watch the Warriors vs Lakers game. We got here a bit earlier  anticipating a big crowd for the game. At first  there were not seats or tables near the bar area  so they sat us down at one of the booths across the room. We were able to see the screen  but it was still a bit far. After 15 minutes at the booth  we noticed a table available near the bar. At that point  we had already gotten our drinks and appetizers (the chicken lettuce wrap and basil thin crust pizza  both were good). The hostess said it was fine as long as we told our server.Bringing out our entrees  I apologized for inconveniencing her  but she was totally cool with it. She helped us move all our stuff over and introduced us to our new server. He was very attentive  just like the first one and we were able to enjoy an exciting game with no issues whatsoever. Our server finished his shift and introduced us to our 3rd server. She was extremely attentive as well. I have to say  for a sports bar/brewery/restaurant  whatever you wanna call it  the service here (at least tonight) is way above par. Usually  when you get servers changing shifts  going on breaks...things can get chaotic and you usually get left behind. But we had a great experience here tonight and we even thought about coming back here the next time we want to watch a game with a big crowd. Don't expect gourmet food...but what you can expect is decent food for its price  a lively ambiance (during game nights) with great service. The beer is pretty good too!
Kimberly Q.,San Francisco  CA,386,242,43,6/11/2008,4.0,Thumbs up to:1. big screen TVs with decent acoustics (perhaps my future home away from home during football season);2. great beer/bar menu and a very tasty filty goose martini;3. deep dish pizzas for which people crave and come forth from the city (my dinner companion chose to drive from the city to this joint because of the buffalo chicken pizza--oh  and um for me too);4. big-ass parking lot;5. avocado egg rolls;6. jamie who gave friendly and patient service in the bar with personality.Thumbs down to the whole chain and/or mall thing  but it does lend to #4 above.
P L.,San Bruno  CA,0,28,,5/22/2013,5.0,This BJ's is great! The staff always remembers me and knows what I like to get. This is not common to find in big-name chains such as BJ's. Well done! I love to come in for lunch and get the endless soup and salad combo. The tomato mozzarella is so delicious and such a good deal!
Kara J.,Pacifica  CA,14,12,4,11/26/2008,5.0,What can I say  I'm a SUCKER for this place!! The Chardonnay Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta plate is probably one of my favorite dishes I've ever had. No joke. Not to mention their wide varieties of beers  dark and light AND all the different games they got going on the big screens. BJ's rules.No pun intended.EPIC WIN.
kim s.,San Francisco  CA,33,27,,7/16/2008,2.0,"My daughter wanted to go here for lunch. I was hesitant  but hubby and I acquiesced in the end. WE got o the counter to give our name. The hostess ignored hubby and continues to chat on the phone. I go up next to him and she hangs up  still ignores hubby but talks to me. (Maybe she didn\'t like what he was wearing that day) I tell her we have two adults and one child. She looks at my daughter who is nine and asks me if she needs a booster seat. My daughter reaches just under my chin  so I\'m thinking she doesn\'t need a booster seat  but ok. My daughter of course looks indignant at the thought of being treated like a babyWe are seated about fifteen minutes later. The waitress comes to our table about 10 minutes after we are seated. We have already decided on what we want. Peanut(my daughter) orders the chicken tenders and a sprite. I order the turkey cobb on whole grain with a cup of soup. She asks twice if I said club to which I respond ""no  I said cobb.""Hubby orders the patty melt rare  with skinny fries and onions on the side. Easy right? It was a bit after one o\'clock so we didn\'t order any starters. Waitress comes back with our drinks pretty quick. About twenty five minutes later Peanuts food comes along with my cup of food. Four other tables have been seated around us at this time. We see all of them get served and their orders come before the rest of our meal. It took about thirty minutes from Peanuts meal to arrive to the time my sandwich and hubby\'s patty melt comes. I sez to myself they must\'ve messed up the order. Sadly  the order was wrong. My sandwich was fine. But hubby got onions in his burger instead of on the side and he got the big steak fries instead of the skinny fries that he asked for. We didn\'t send it back because we are now hungry. Note  I think it\'s cool when you can memorize orders and not have to write it on tickets. But if you have suck memory  write it down. And if the order is messed up  have the decency to come tell us. It would have saved your tip. Won\'t be back by choice."
Carlos W.,Oakland  CA,56,62,6,6/29/2011,4.0,Graet Corporate food. Allway good. Everything i've ever has has been good. Great Place to take kids. Clean  Safe  Easy to park.
Kim R.,San Francisco  CA,475,378,68,1/28/2007,3.0,I was starving so I am giving this spot 4 stars because when I got to the mall I found a close parking right away also there were HELL of people waiting and I eyespied 2 ladies leaving @ a small table near the bar and I jumped on it. The busser was real cool and so was the waitress   I ordered a french dip and a side cesar salad. It was decent I also ate 1 of my friends chicken strips ( Tasty)...I also drank a hefeweizen and tried the 4 beer sampler I like the blonds and ambers myself. Pretty good I would come here again and usually I hate these corparate places.
Denise M.,South San Francisco  CA,203,1021,8,8/2/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,This review is specifically for the Pina Chocotini that I've been recently introduced to. Creamy  dreamy  delicious. Asked our bartender Steve for something a cocktail recommendation based with coconut. Now I have to learn how to make this at home. Malibu rum with pineapple juice  Midori  whipped cream and a swirl of chocolate syrup. OMG - I totally could have skipped dinner and just had a million of these all night.  Instead  I just had two. ;)
Winnie L.,San Francisco  CA,121,141,976,6/29/2008,4.0,I love restaurants like these  serving American-Italian food and deep dish pizza! We came by here for dinner after shopping at the mall. The wait wasn't bad  around 20 mins. It was my first time and my best friend's experiences held me at high expectations.We ordered the wedge salad  classic stuffed potato and BJ's favorite deep dish pizza. All of them were delicious and scrumptious. Great place for some classier comfort food.
Tiff W.,San Francisco  CA,323,1281,143,10/4/2009,4.0,I know I know  it's a chain BUT the food was good. I liked it. generous portions  came here a few times and each time I had a great time with the exception of one thing  waiting.
Sabrina L.,Manhattan  NY,2,8,,12/20/2008,2.0,"You know  this restaurant is really a shame. It\'s big  it\'s fun  it\'s a cross between your Chilis/Applebees/Fridays chain and Cheesecake Factory with its sprawling menu. The decor is fine  it\'s a good location  and the food is actually pretty decent. But the service is terrible.50 minute wait on a Saturday evening  impressive for a place of this size. Then  my ""Shirley Temple"" came out as a Sprite. Once it was ""shirleyed"" there was no cherry  which is a no-no in my book.Then when my sourdough bacon cheeseburger came out  it was missing the bacon and cheese. When we alerted them  we were told it would be a moment and they would fix it. About 15 minutes later  when everyone else I was with had almost finished  it finally came back. The manager said it would be on the house. Lo and behold  when the check arrived  we were charged for it.So I\'m not a fan of the way they do business here.However  the food is pretty good. We started with Best Beginnings  the combo appetizer plate of mozzarella sticks  spinach and artichoke dip  santa fe springrolls and avocado egg rolls. These are personally the appetizers I would least like to have in a combo platter; I think they should offer some more choice in that regard. The mozzarella sticks were appropriately gooey and well-seasoned  and the avocado egg rolls were pretty good - and I don\'t usually like avocado. Spring rolls were fine  and everyone loved the spinach and artichoke dip  although I found it too creamy and flat in flavor for my taste. It needed some kick.My burger was also quite good. A little too big to eat  and the beef could maybe have had more seasoning. The sauce wasn\'t exactly well balanced either. REALLY good french fries  though.Other dishes I\'m told are good are the meatloaf sandwich and the Santa Fe salad. I will have to report back on those  if I ever decide to try this place again. Iffy given my experience with the service.Don\'t expect much  and you\'ll be pleasantly surprised. I went in hoping for more."
claudia y.,San Francisco  CA,749,997,2366,7/9/2009,3.0,we came here on a tuesday night and this place was packed with people! maybe summer makes people came out. for 4 the wait was 15 to 20 minutes but i think they didnt call us until half an hour later. they do have a call ahead list so thats probably a smarter option. we ended up just sitting at the bar and eating there.our bartender was super friendly. the bar had two bartenders total and even the other guy came to check in on us every once in a while.i had a jerry berry which is the berry cider mixed with the jeremiah red. pretty good. we all shared the brushetta  spinach dip  shrimp lettuce wraps  cobb salad  meat loaf entree  and a mediterranean pizza.the bruschetta was almost like a french toast. the tomatoes come in a bowl and you scoop it onto the buttery bread yourself. the dip was a good consistency and very flavorful. it came with red  blue and gold tortilla chips. the shrimp lettuce wraps were good but spicy. cobb salad had just lettuce  turkey  croutons  and cheese. not like other cobbs i guess. the meat loaf entree came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. the mediterranean pizza was just ok. the crust is too thick and bready for me. and i didnt like the olives.
A P.,San Francisco  CA,1163,377,18,9/25/2006,4.0,"I gotta say I have always loved this place  I first tried it in LA  when the hubby took me for the first time. He always tells me the story about how he used to think the name of this place was funny when he was in high school. ""You know BJ? Blow Job?""I proceeded to remind him he was no longer in High School.Okay  while not fine dining or as good as some of the local mom and pop haunts we usually go to  I have to say that for a corporate model  I\'ll take BJ\'s over Elephant Bar or any other ""large format corporate restaurant"".Yeah you have to wait  it\'s busy most of the time  but just get a buzzin pager and walk next door to Barnes & Noble and browse some books while you wait  or walk through the mall when it\'s open.The Avocado spring rolls were good but it needed more of a lime dipping sauce  the sweet syrupy stuff wasn\'t cutting it. I\'m spoiled by Eric\'s. The chicken tenders were great with honey mustard dipping sauce. The pasta\'s are underwhelming and but have some potential  it just needed something. Their beers are pretty good and well priced too!The Pizza is good. You see I like deep dish with the ingredients piled high  cheese and sauce oozing out. But I also like a slightly thicker crust with lots\'o ingredients but not completely soggy. Depends on the mood. I was in the mood for the latter. Their BJ\'s Special (grin - yeah I know how that sounds) is great for peeps who love hot meat with their BJ\'s Special.PIZOOKIE!!!!!!!!!!! Can I say YUM!?! A freshly baked humungo cookie piping hot with vanilla bean ice cream on top! (we took this to go cause we had to go home and watch Desperate Housewives.) Pizookie and Desperate Housewives are the perfect match!"
Kat R.,Los Angeles  CA,341,333,15,5/9/2007,4.0,It's like a tgifridays but good. Good drinks  good dessert  good food. I love the tomato and cheese pizza and chocolate chip pizooki.  That's all I need at BJs. Though their hard cider is good as well. Reasonably priced and the only mall restaurant that really gets me going. BJs and Monster Desserts in one place? This is what makes San Bruno stand out in my book. Mmm.....BJs.
Wilson C.,Fremont  CA,120,177,,5/9/2008,4.0,My friend said I was supposed to give this place 5 stars because of the pizookie alone but I think I'll give it four until I go back and try their chicken sandwich  which I hear is the best ever. We came here on a Tuesday night for dinner and the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday. We had to wait half an hour for our table  which I don't know was necessary or not. I saw some empty tables on our way to be seated. The menu is huge. They have quite a few things to choose from so you wont have to worry about not finding something you like. If you're a beer fan  this is another one of those microbreweries in the bay. I didn't try any of the beers so I can't say if it's good or not. We ordered a couple pizzas to share and from what I know  they're known for their Pizza. They have the deep dish Chicago style pizza which reminds me more of Pizza' Chicago than Zachary's (not layered with sauce on top). We great white pizza was really good and I would recommend ordering that. I thought the dough was really good but to me it resembles Pizza Hut dough  which I also really like.My friend who's been to several BJ's says they have the best chicken sandwich in the world so I will try that next time and perhaps that will earn this place an extra star.For dessert  they have this thing called a pizookie  which is a fresh baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream on it. Sure  it sounds simple but when you bite into the warm cookie with the ice cream  it makes going to the restaurant worth while.
Ivana C.,San Lorenzo  CA,1,5,,4/21/2009,3.0,It was my first time eating at BJ's when I went yesterday with my friends; it was a quarter til five  on a monday. I seriously never heard of this place before  but when we entered in  it reminded me of a high class applebee's... and i'm not complaining. But damn  they had hella plasmas. I didn't count  but sheesh  what happened to saving energy.The wait for our tables wasn't long; it only took about under ten minutes but I've heard it gets pretty crowded near the end of the week. The waitress showed us to our seats and gave us the menus. When I opened my menu  a little stick with a hook and brush one the ends fell out. My friend told me it was a tool to clean ear pieces for for those that can't hear well. I was kind of disgusted. Our server was really nice to us. He even apologized when he gave us the wrong pizzookie. 0__o My friends also told me he was flirting with me. I should say first that I was fifthwheelin' lol. I thought that was amusing though. haha. What bothered me was how long the wait was to get our food. It took what.... 30 maybe 45 minutes to bring out three entrees. It took super long to me! I was so hungry because I had not eaten the whole day. I can't lie  the food I ate was delicious. I ordered the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza. It was pretty good. My friends ordered some spaghetti dish and some small burgers [i don't know what it's called right now] with some crispy fries. Good portions  decent price for it i guess. For desert we ordered the Oreo pizzookie and the triple chocolate chunk pizookie. Like I said earlier  the server messed up the order and instead of the chocolate chunk pizookie  gave us the original one. It took another 5 some minutes for our dessert  but at least he apologized.All in all  I would like to come back again  and I hope that their management would improve: three stars!
Tracie P.,San Bruno  CA,223,256,109,10/17/2005,4.0,Update: Well it can still get pretty busy here. And I don't think its the food (which can range from ok to great) but rather a great place to be and drink  dine and watch tv. Service can be inconsistant but I still come here to grab a resonably decent meal.I really liked it. We went opening weekend  so it was the zoo you thought it would be. We were told 1.5 hr wait and we had put our name in before our walk throught the mall. It was crowded and we ended up finding a table in the bar before we were seated. The atmosphere was pretty rocking though maybe that was the Cal v UCLA game and its devotees. The food was yum. Still prefer the Cobb at American Bull. Great children's menu. We got to sample the pizza as they were handing out sample to those of us waiting and waiting. Best feature: The outdoor pation with heat lamps and a fire pit plus wind guard. Last point  in spite of how much of a zoo it was with everyone wanting to get in  all the staff  had a non frenzied attitude and treated you like you were their only customer. From the check in girl to the bus guy to the wait staff  they had great service. I will be back and not just cuz I like their beer.
Barb B.,San Jose  CA,135,619,30,6/3/2007,2.0,"So  I come home and tell my better half I visited BJ\'s and had a fish taco with my two old Aunties. He looks at me sideways  and asks  ""You did what where and with who?""How else are you supposed to explain your mediocre lunch? The taco was ok.....a lot of of lettuce filler and buried deep down was a fish stick (""you had WHAT??"") Like the BJ\'s down the peninsula  the place is not for those sensitive to auditory stimuli. The place is inundated with a plethora of noise from the TV\'s  loud music  cell phones going off  and loud talking all at the same time. If I had Tourette\'s  I might have fit right in."
Mosey S.,San Francisco  CA,147,148,10,5/23/2011,3.0,It's not worth any type of a wait but as far as volume cooking goes  it's good. Their specialty is the deep dish pizza  but they offer a very comprehensive menu that may be a challenge to any first-timers. Stick with the simple pastas  they are cheaper and healthier. Good for groups  good for families  good for having a few beers and watching the game.
Pauline L.,San Francisco  CA,83,588,,6/2/2008,3.0,"You lost me at ""2 hour waiting time"". Our lively group of 8 which dropped down to 6 when we finally did the head count likened this place rather like reading a bad trashy novel with no plot and crappy love scenes. You think you\'re going to make it to the end  but it keeps going on and on..sigh...The food isn\'t bad when we weren\'t waiting for our food for half an hour. It\'s not that long to make a salad guys. I got the New England clam chowder. The clams were minced into teeny tiny pieces  not chunks...but the potato to meat ratio is quite good. The breadbowl is french crust  not sourdough...and they toast the top with garlic and parsley..yummers.Everyone else was losing what sad marbles we had left after watching Indy 4. The movie is definitely suspend the reality bit  but it was popcorn fare after all. 2 hour movie plus heavy food = sleepyheads.Good parking situation and nice food court. It\'s not Dave and Busters so the wait is kinda weird. Eh...you get what you get when you come."
Chatree T.,San Francisco  CA,36,198,82,11/22/2007,2.0,1 star for the awesome tequila mocking bird drink  and another for feeding me while I waited.I had the fish taco  it was very fishy. BLAH. The pazookie or whatever is not that great. It's just ice cream on top of a cookie!Wouldn't dine here again.
Laura U.,San Francisco  CA,57,8,11,8/21/2008,3.0,My favorite is the avocado rolls..Yummm! Love them! I enjoy their beer selection but when you sit at their bar  service takes forever!
Leticia S.,Daly City  CA,3,7,,9/19/2009,5.0,"Love this place! This is the go to spot for me and my besties. Sometimes waiting for a seat near the bar or even for a table can take forever  but at the end of the meal  I\'m always in a happy mood leaving BJs. I recommend the white zin  ""a drink like that""  and the berry burst cider for drinks...yum yum yum.And I just recently had the chicken pot stickers--not so bad--but my buddies and I always order the avacado eggrolls even if we\'re not that hungry! lol and if I\'m feeling extra NOT hungry I order the chocolate chip pazookie. lol my favorite! everything else is good so I recommend ordering anything from the menu."
Zac Y.,San Mateo  CA,0,14,75,1/15/2013,1.0,the only reason why i will give them a star is because they have good wings there  other than that is really no reason to go there  the staff is not professional  me and 6 of my friends was waited for 30 mins at the front desk  not even one of them come say anything  i wonder why don't these people just quit their job if they are so unwanted to service people.
Rick V.,South San Francisco  CA,14,178,3,11/10/2007,1.0,Words I'll never forget:'Let's go to Tanforan for dinner!'When waiting a long time to be seated  you expect some gratification from a dining experience. The service is pretty poor. The food didn't suck  I guess... it's just when and how I got it. I would think they would like having to prepare a steak medium rare... less cooking time  less work... Yeah  I sent the thing back to have them try again... baked potato was pretty good unusually large. And all the pizzas looked pretty good... lots of folks ordered them. Too bad... I wanted steak. Look at all of the pizzas that were being served... So they cooked me another steak. I couldn't wait any more... the potato was getting cold.You can wait by the register. OR wait at the bar... have a salad  gnaw on the sprouts  order another micro beer  watch Alex Smith get sacked again. Watch the pizzas go by... Just don't order the steak.
Wilhelm Y.,San Francisco  CA,704,1004,3592,1/28/2007,3.0,After walking around Tanforan Mall for the first time since its renovation a friend and I ate here last night. Maybe we ordered the wrong menu items  but my conclusion was this ... come for the beer  not the food.6 PM on a Saturday night and this place is packed; there are about twenty people waiting for tables and possibly more outside of the restaurant. The young lady at the reservation podium tells us it will be a 45 minute wait. The Winter X Games are on several of the flat panel tv's that surround this restaurant. It's the men's snowboarding half pipe finals. We'll watch and wait. 35 minutes later and our pager buzzes; we're seated.I started out with the Brewhouse Blonde  and I found it a bit on the lighter side. It was good though. My friend orders the minestrone for starters and a meat lasagna. I order the house salad with honey mustard and a pot roast entree. The food arrived fairly quickly  and I must add that the two people who worked our table were superb. I had a spoonful of soup. It was good. The vegetables on the salad were cold and crisp  but something about the taste of the croutons was very annoying. My beer is gone by then  and I order a hefeweizen. I enjoyed the flavor of this beer much more than the first. The serving of lasagna was a bit small and smothered in way too much meat sauce. The two slices of garlic toast that came with the entree almost equaled its size. The pot roast was tender and flavorful and I liked the white cheddar mashed potatoes  but the whole plate was drowned in a salty brown gravy. The steamed veggies served on the side were good. Anyway I got a chance to view the conclusion of the snowboarding so I was happy.I'd give this place 3 and a half stars if I could. Considering how many people were dining at the time  the service was excellent and the beer is very good. Our food could have been much better.
Tony L.,San Francisco  CA,664,1261,21,8/23/2007,3.0,Yup  it's a chain. And like all chains you get decent tasting food. I don't know why knowing that the same dish you're eating is being reproduced at hundreds of locations across the country makes it less appetizing. It's not that way with alcohol or other beverages. Does anybody ever complain about mass produced sodas? Not as much as chains.But whatever  if you're not here for the food  you're here for the alcohol. What's even better is you can drink your alcohol while smoking beside a fire pit on the outside. The food  yeah  it's alright. And I'm pretty disappointed that management hasn't taken stock of the fact that their waiters need to kiss a little more ass with all these 1-2 star reviews.Nevertheless  I still have hope for this BJ's. It's big  it's got a lot of large flat screen monitors to watch sports on. And it's got a fire pit. I just hope I'm not around when a fight breaks out.
Tracy Y.,Bay Area,127,148,381,5/12/2010,2.0,This place is REALLY slow. It's okay if you're busy catching up with friends so you don't notice that you've been sitting there for 15 minutes or more before they even take your order. The waiters don't really come to check up on you wither. Tonight was the third time I've been to this location and I ordered the meatloaf sandwich because I had that last time it was really good. The onion strings and mashed potatoes on top of the meatloaf and bread is so good. However  tonight's meatloaf sandwich was okay  but definitely not as good as it was last time. Also  their mango mojito tasted like orange soda somehow? I don't know  I think this BJ's failed me this time.
Naima B.,Santa Rosa  CA,60,35,,6/24/2010,3.0,Although this may be a great restaurant for watching the upcoming game and having a few drinks  the food is so-so for dinner. One great dish that i had was the small appetizer- mozzarella and tomato salad  which was excellent and just the right size with great flavor. i was disappointed though with their calzone (spinach and artichoke) although the server seemed to rave about it....it just didnt seem to have much flavor. I would prefer to come here for lunch and grab a deep dish pizza with a salad for $5.95 and call it a meal!
Binary G.,Austin  TX,2,14,,1/5/2011,2.0,The four hostesses standing in front didn't greet us for about 2 minutes  even though we were standing right in front of them. Our server was good  and the burger was really good. The rest of the staff were on the rude side; hence the 2 stars.
Ken B.,San Francisco  CA,4,480,11,3/29/2008,3.0,For what this place does  it's always incredibly busy during the lunch hour. We choose this place for group lunches from the office. I'm not sure why  because it's always very crowded at lunchtime. The service is always friendly and attentive. The menu is sufficiently diverse  too. A co-worker had one of those giant stuffed potatoes  it must have been some GM hybrid because it looked about 2-3 lbs! I like the soup and 1/2 sandwich. They use some nice multi-grain bread. Of course the main attraction would be the big beer selection and sports on HDTV everywhere. This isn't the perfect lunch atmosphere for me  and when you're not into the game  it is just useless background noise.
Dee D.,San Francisco  CA,296,445,2002,7/15/2009,5.0,Wow  surprise  surprise  I have always wanted to try this place  and what a shock! Great service @ the bar  after 10pm happy hour  FREE BEER SAMPLES! LOVE IT! I will be back!
AhLin C.,San Francisco  CA,127,575,6,4/29/2010,3.0,Can't complain about their pizza really. It's really good!! However  service is not that great. There is a long wait all the time and of course us being San Franciscans turn our nose up at chain restaurants. But nevertheless  come and order their pizza. They are like Cheesecake Factory. It's really good and fun once in awhile.
Jenny W.,San Francisco  CA,6,26,,10/23/2008,3.0,Came here for my sister's birthday lunch with the family. We had 2 different waitresses serving our table. The food portions are very generous and the prices are fair. They take reservations for large parties. They messed up on my brother's order and brought out a garden burger when he ordered a regular cheeseburger. The manager came out to apologize  gave him the cheeseburger on the house. Great customer service!
Kevin I.,Concord  CA,1,5,,2/26/2009,4.0,I love BJ's mostly because of the beer...I really enjoy the atmosphere. It is laid back and not too loud so it is easy to talk with friends and relax with some drinks and pizza. I just tried the Pumpkin Ale on a whim and...IT WAS DELICIOUS. It definately has a different yet pleasant taste and now it gives me another excuse to go out there on the weekends.
Omar B.,San Francisco  CA,172,23,1,1/7/2010,4.0,bj's is cool..i've found myself visiting a lot more lately since i just turned 21.. haha..but anywayi tend to come here later in the night for either a quick beer and some quite tasty appetizers.. the main reason why i come here later at night is because i want a snack late at night and its open and the restaurant has a very comfy and cozy environment..the thai shrimp lettuce wraps are SO GOOD!i pretty much only order appetizers here but if you do decide to order something larger...the deep dish pizza's are really good!!try coming by when its not typical lunch and dinner time because this place gets PACKED!..like over an hour wait PACKED!4 stars!
kiki d.,San Francisco  CA,24,232,,2/7/2008,4.0,-great spinach artichoke dip (sometimes we get two orders)-Good deep dish is hard to find on this coast...nummy :)Takeout is relatively pain free. On a Thursday / Friday night  it takes about 30 minutes from ordering to receiving the food (including a deep dish pizza).Sometimes they walk around handing out free pizza...:)
Emily M.,Redwood City  CA,174,742,6,3/3/2007,3.0,Pretty much what you would expect for a place like this. Service was pretty bad  but it was also quite busy on the Friday afternoon I went with my co-workers. If we hadn't found a spot outside  the wait would have been 25 minutes. The company was paying  so I couldn't get too worked up about whether or not the food was good or bad. :) What I had was pretty good - fish tacos. Also had a Jeremiah Red beer  which was enjoyable.Anyway  not high class  but serves a purpose. Nice for a Friday lunch with co-workers  anyway.
Carmina C.,San Bruno  CA,0,2,,2/9/2013,1.0,Crap service. We ordered over the phone  waited about an hour to pick it up  and when we got there  we were told no order under my name was in the system. They asked us if we wanted to order again  but we were starving and didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.
An N.,Hilo  HI,132,67,17,4/4/2010,4.0,I love this place for Happy Hour. The South Bay is seriously lacking a good place to drink post-work and this place has awesome food and BEER BEER BEER. Nothing like a pitcher of Hef/Blue Moon to pair with a tasty pizza  hot wings or lettuce wraps. Happy Hour discounts are quite reasonable too. Half price on single sized pizzas and a couple of bucks off of beer. Only downside is the lack of parking. But Apple is very generous with their parking lot so that's BJ's saving grace. Definitely try this place out for a casual evening with some friends.
Lisa L.,Millbrae  CA,0,3,,2/6/2013,4.0,I am a big fan of chain restaurants. I've been here many times. I usually ordered balsamic glazed chicken and parmesan crusted chicken breast....bruschetta to start with. Food was great as always. I gave it 4 stars because food portions are much smaller than it used to be.
Jin B.,San Francisco  CA,821,202,104,9/17/2009,2.0,I don't understand why  but BJ's is ALWAYS so packed. Hasn't the pizookie craze gone down yet? Seriously? And the beers are alright. Why can't we make reservations ahead of time? Someone needs to change that  because the first come first serve thing  ain't workin'  and you lose business quick that way. I used to really like appetizers. But I think the quality has gone down due to the recession...? Happy Hour is always great though here. But if there were any OTHER bar availble in the San Bruno area...I would DEFINITELY much would rather go elsewhere than here.
Herb C.,Bellevue  WA,34,118,,8/2/2006,3.0,The service here at BJ's is hit or miss. I've been there a couple of times and some times it's really great and other times  we watched in horror as plates of food made it out fo the kitchen only to be looped around the entire restrauant (becuase the servers didn't know their table #'s) and back into the kitchen. If you're a fan of big portions  then this is the place for you. I could just come here to share a plate of their nachos ($7.95) and that would fill me up. Of course  I had to order a sandwich and a salad as well  so i was uber-stuffed since I was taught to not waste any food.  I've gone to BJ's at 11am on a Sunday and there was no wait. I think the wait happens when people actually eat lunch and dinner since the kitchen service is kind of slow.  They have alot of flat screen tv's that broadcast whatever is on (mainly sports) but sometimes you can get your fill of infomercials.... although it's not as fun if you can't hear the people selling the product.
Efrain T.,Pacifica  CA,46,146,45,3/25/2012,3.0,Why do the appetizers always show up at the same time as the entrees? Even if I ask the waiter/waitress that I want to start off with an appetizer  they either bring it with the entree or completely forget it. Last visit  our Jay Baruchel-looking waiter delivered our pizza without our salad and fried artichoke appetizers. The artichokes came about 10 minutes after the pizza but we decided to cancel the salad. Granted the pizza is still good  but I think I might have to avoid going on the weekends because the staff doesn't seem to have their A-game.
Andreia A.,San Mateo  CA,4,4,,8/22/2009,4.0,Loved the place! Had a fun time with my friends  good apettizers and drinks and fabulous beer!I will sure go there again!
Amy B.,San Francisco  CA,228,385,3,5/21/2007,3.0,As you know  for every rule there is an exception. As a rule  I HATE chain restaurants. Hate them. The food sucks  the prices are too high  and often the people eating there consider the Olive Garden as fine Italian dining. The exception to this rule is BJ's brewery. I have eaten at multiple BJ's across the state and consistently enjoy their food. The avocado egg rolls are great; the salads are fabulous  and huge; the sandwiches are perfect; and the stuffed baked potatoes are good. Of course  the only reason to go anywhere is for its dessert. The chocolate chip pizza cookie thingie is so super yummy. So why only 3 stars? Well  as much as I enjoyed my cobb salad at my first time at this particular BJ's  it's difficult to enjoy when everything is so disgustingly dirty. The table was greasy  the menus looked (and felt!) like they hadn't been cleaned in a year  and every single peice of silverware we had received had to be replaced. And then even the replacement had to be wiped with a napkin. Now  I'm not a finicky germ phobe in the least  but this place even made me cringe. As much as I love the food and vibe at BJ's  I probably will not be returning to this particular location.
Jennifer H.,Daly City  CA,0,20,1,1/15/2013,1.0,Where to start! I guess I will start with the pros. BJ's have a great pazookie and the pizza and wings are pretty good! Okay  now with the bad.. This place does NOT have the best service for starters. Their drinks are expensive and nOT great.. Okay  here goes the bIG one- I have some teenagers from my work who went out to eat here. They ordered non alcoholic drinks seeing how they are NOT of age to drink and had no desire to do so. The server brought them alcoholic beverages which they were not aware until they took a sip of the drinks. This is unexceptable. If I were the parent of these children- I would have sued bJs  I wish the parents took it further  however  they did not.
A L.,San Francisco  CA,5,77,2,11/30/2007,2.0,I've been here a total of three times. The first time  not happy. The second time  super not happy. My freaking salad was 98.2 percent lettuce and the rest was a pinch of eggs  bacon  and other crap that I couldn't remember because why? BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE IT ON MY SALAD.The third time? Not bad. You exceeded my expectations. Our waiter was good and the food was actually better. Yeah for the angel hair pasta. BJ's  I sort of forgive you for my lettuce salad......
Antonio A.,South San Francisco  CA,0,6,,1/12/2013,2.0,Food was good and Customer service was alright but toward the end of our family lunch  we ordered 3 pizookies. 2 chocolate chip and 1 raspberry white chocolate almond. We waited for 30 minutes or so for them. The waiter brought 2 chocolate chips out but not the raspberry. He told us that it would take a few more minutes...we waited another 15 minutes until the waiter came by and told us the cookers messed up on the raspberry order and asked if i wanted to wait or remove that order from our check. I asked how long more would I wait for the raspberry pizookie and he said 10 minutes. I told him forget it and just remove it from my check...but then  I waited for more then 5 minutes for my check (I could of just waited for the damn pizookie). They just didn't seem sincere about us waiting for so long.
Melissa L.,Sunnyvale  CA,101,38,,11/5/2007,3.0,I have to say I like the layout of the restaurant. It seems very spacious and open. I like their bar area and all the tv screens they have. This is a good place for college kids  and even for some business people (since it's located next to a lot of companies  like Apple)  and It also closes late.I don't come here for the food because honestly its not very impressive. However  try their beer; you can go from a blonde to a stout with everything in between. The best reason to come here  and the reason I keep coming back is their Pizookie! Basically it's a cookie with vanilla bean ice cream that you can probably make at home  but it's freakin good! My fave is the chocolate chunk. Mmmm. Yum!
Mike G.,San Francisco  CA,72,62,11,9/5/2008,4.0,I think the food is good an d the portions are generous.Service is OK but could be better. My experience when I have gone there is that the waiter and the person delivering the food do not have a system of knowing who gets what. It really bugs me that the server is always asking us who gets what.
E Y.,Daly City  CA,0,9,,1/7/2013,2.0,"The food was ""ok"" but I could not enjoy it because the service was so bad. I went on a Saturday night so I guess that was mistake number 1. I waited in line to put my name on the list and the place was so chaotic it turns out I was in the wrong line. Even though the person who told me this was standing next to the person taking names  she sent me to a different line. Then I waited for 25 mins just to get a pager! Finally I found an open seat at the bar instead. By the time I managed to get a menu my pager had finally gone off. Everything else was painfully slow. Getting a glass of water... ordering my meal.... getting a fork to be able to eat my meal.... at least I knew why my dessert took so long to come out... because it was burnt."
gordon g.,San Francisco  CA,364,94,4,1/19/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,The wait was mighty long but we walked for a litle bit in the Mall. We had da big ass Nacho's for appetizer. For mains we ordered my Baby back baby back ribs  ooooh they were so off da bone yummy and a deep dish Mediteranean Pizza. Everything came out tasty and hot  we were stuffed after eating most of it up. Definitely the place to go if you're hungry cuz the portions are large enough to fill ya.
Hyung L.,San Francisco  CA,218,414,12,8/24/2009,3.0,"Place is one of the few ""chain"" type Elephant Bar\'ish type places open serving food until 11 on a Sunday. I used to live across the street also. It\'s pretty typical of a type place like this. Decent bar food menu. Pizza burgers. Gargantuan baked potatoes and deep dish is kinda their specialty. Nice bar. It would get more stars but in comparison to an Elephant bar the drinks are definitely pricier. It\'s decent though."
J P.,Sunnyvale  CA,56,192,26,4/3/2008,3.0,"Slow service at the bar made this evening much longer than it needed to be. My girlfriend and I met here as a mid-point between her Marin apartment and my Peninsula apartment. I was a bit late and she spent the time studying the tome of a menu.We both had white wine from the pretty decent wine list. I had the fish tacos. Not great. The ""guacamole"" was this weird creamy bland concoction and the ""salsa"" was watery and boring - a little smoky  but otherwise flavorless. The fish itself was good  but the whole dish lacked spice. Just ridiculous. GF had a good-looking salad with breaded chicken and seasoned wedge fries. The fries may have been the best of everything; they were plentiful and really cheap - $3.95 I think.There were about three people behind the bar. Sometimes. Since I was never offered water  when I tried to order some there was absolutely no one behind the bar. We were asked once ""how is everything""  which is fine  but how often is it that you actually know what you need when they come by to ask? Almost never for me. So when I did need something  the place was a ghost-town.I\'ll be back (maybe) because the location is so convenient for us to meet  but otherwise  I wouldn\'t go out of my way to come here."
Grace R.,Cerritos  CA,45,59,,2/14/2010,3.0,It's a really a-ok average restaurant. The wait is long depending on which day you go. Valentine's Day....2 hours last year. Yeah  it was a last minute plan. The food is pretty good. I always order the honey crisp chicken salad and I like the happy hours where personal pans are only $5 with half-off selected appetizers  but the wait after you get a table is ridiculous. I know it is not all of the waiters' fault because they seem like they're trying their best to hurry up and be on time  but I always notice that there are not enough staff working  especially during the busy times. I know BJ's might be trying to save a little money cutting down on the staff  but please  to an extent. Not 5 people working for 60 guests. Other than that  it's ok. Go here if you need a late night snack or if you have time to kill.
Marlon E.,San Bruno  CA,386,80,109,3/28/2008,4.0,Whenever I go to BJ's  I usually get the Great White pizza and a chocolate chip pizookie. Yeah  not ideal for those who are on a diet  but if you're in the mood for indulging  why not go all the way?I've had all of their beers  and...they were alright. Didn't really blow me away or anything  although I'm not actually that big of a beer drinker.Yeah  the food is a bit pricey for its size  but it's oh so good. Especially the pizookie--a big  warm  chocolate chip cookie with some vanilla ice cream scoops on top. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water  haha. So simple. What a great invention. By the way  they give it away for free if it's your birthday  too.I've only been to 2 BJ's--the one here  and the one in Cupertino. Overall  I would say that both are the same. Pretty good food  average prices  good service.
Sha s.,San Mateo  CA,0,6,,12/15/2012,2.0,Went for an early lunch with a friend yesterday and regretted it. Had a disinterested server who served tea late ( at $2.75 for one cup of hot water!)   failed to bring one of us water  was late with the check and never asked how we were doing. The food was barely warm. They were not busy when we went so can't explain this. I like their menu and prices but will not visit this location again!
Janell Y.,San Francisco  CA,70,103,,3/3/2009,2.0,"The food here is like your average chain of restaurants like Chili\'s  Macaroni Grill and so forth so it\'s a given there will be plenty of good stuff on the menu that\'s a little over priced. Not to mention  their pizookies are the bomb but of course how can you go wrong with warm cookies & ice cream? Now I have to say most people come for the pizookies  pizza and alcohol because the bar is crackin and it\'s open late. They also make their own beers which are pretty damn good.By the sound of it  it would seem I\'d rate this a 3 star at least but I\'d have to say their service is horrible. It\'s not that their entirely rude or anything but it\'s just horrible. The hosts/hostesses half the time aren\'t paying attention and are busy chatting up a storm with each other. I don\'t really care much for it until it takes forever for them to stop talking so I can tell them I want to sit. When I do finally sit down  my server usually disappears or forgets something like my water. Or my salad. Or my dinner mates soup. Or an entire order while out with a huge group. I know service can\'t always be perfect but you\'d think it would happen at least once  even when it\'s just me and another person but nope  it hasn\'t. The service is even worse when it\'s a huge group  it takes hours to get seated and they don\'t allow you to reserve. I don\'t know why they don\'t because the one in San Jose does and I believe they get a lot more business then here. I understand if it takes a long time to seat a huge party but for the times when it took forever (1-2 hours)  the place wasn\'t busy at all.Eh. I\'ve been here on more than several occasions  usually with a large group and I\'ve been there a few times with just me and another and nothing has ever improved. I don\'t really know how to explain it. The place is alright but the service sucks and it\'s not the ""omg I can\'t believe that just happened"" type of service. It\'s the basic things they seem to have forgotten and if you can tolerate that then this isn\'t so bad of a place. As for me  this wouldn\'t be the first or really last place to want to go to with a bunch of my friends."
Gracie-C Y.,San Francisco  CA,76,307,2,9/9/2007,3.0,"Slummin\' in the Peninsula Part IVWelcome to me and the wifey\'s fourth (and final) installment of what we call ""slummin\' in the peninsula"".You see  we\'ve done some soul-searching lately.Some people have accused us of losing touch with the ""common-folk""... of forgetting our roots.Well we decided to show them. We\'ll prove to you all that we\'re not above the common man  that we\'ll get our hands dirty if necessary  and that we have a soft spot in our cold little hearts for the ""little people"".- I suggested to wifey that we stroll the Tenderloin  but she crossed that off our list because the parking\'s too tough.- Was gonna try Bayview-Hunter\'s Point  but I just had the car detailed.- Thought about giving Oakland a spin  but couldn\'t scrape together the change to cross the bridge.So wifey and I decide to mingle with the commoners on the Peninsula.

Lily X.,San Francisco  CA,0,88,2,7/28/2008,3.0,Good food  Long wait  reasonably priced. Quite dark inside  but nothing wrong with that.. its got a comfy feeling to it.. :]-x3 shells
Peggy W.,Los Angeles  CA,284,603,43,2/22/2007,4.0,BJ's here deserve four stars for handling a group of 18 beautifully. Waiter couldve been a little more friendly but the food came out at a good time and they worked well with me when I needed to surprise the boyfriend with a big cake. Topped with free candles. The food is consistent and I think it's a lot better than most other chain food restaurants. It's a fun atmosphere  very laid back and we all had plenty of room to talk  drink lots of beer  and have a good time. I like their bartenders too. My recommendation for the go-to place for a large birthday party. Variety in menu means something for everyone!But I just can't give five stars to a chain restaurant. But this is as good as it gets in surburbia!
Marc E.,Daly City  CA,63,172,4,9/15/2008,3.0,Nice place to dine with friends and family.There's an outdoor area with heat torches to keep you warm if you decide to eat outside. Nice! They also have a nice bar area.Some great American food. They have some good appetizers. I loved the Cuban Hamburger and the Jambalya. I wanna try the other entrees soon!Parking is aiight  what do you expect  it's at the Tanforan mall.
Angie C.,Oakland  CA,119,430,6,12/3/2006,4.0,Yes  it's a chain... but it's an awesome chain. I used to frequent the one in Westwood back in my college years. This one is just as good - actually better. It's bigger  with open spaces  and an outside area. The outside area is great in nice weather. They have a lunch special which I get often. It comes with a small pizza and a salad. I am in LOVE with their pizookies. Oh my gosh  soooooo good. I usually get chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top  but have mixed it up a few times and gotten 1/2 white choc macadamia 1/2 choc. chip. Equally amazing!Also  they have good beers. I'm partial to the nutty brewnette.
Larry A.,San Francisco  CA,92,258,33,3/5/2007,3.0,Typical chain experience here. Nothing to add  except don't order the French Dip.  It's small and served on an over sized flimsy hot dog bun that dissolves when you dip it in the au jus. I hate that. Not a good value. Shoulda stuck with the pizza. My wife ordered the NY strip. It came with a football sized baked potato. HUGE! The steak was...eh  not bad  but not worth the 18.95. Not bad tasting  but not a great value either.  Despite the lack luster dinner  it's not a bad place to kill time while your wife spends your paycheck in the mall.
patrick o.,San Francisco  CA,95,199,1,6/13/2007,3.0,Like all good things you can't have it too much. I have been here now probably about 5-6 times  everytime it seems to get worse. The first couple of times  it felt like the spot to be. Good beer  good pizza  a million tvs playing sports  good crowd  decent decor. Then the pizza didn't taste as good  beer sets in as beer belly and all of a sudden theres a freaking bunch of kids running around like its chuckecheese. Why does everything that adults like have to be pussied up for the kids? Can't adults go anywhere anymore? Vegas at first? D&B's? What's next kid platters at stripclubs? This place is always crowded. I don't think I have ever NOT had to wait at least 20-45 minutes. The food isn't too bad  I like the Great white pizza  the pasta is bland and the appetizers can be decent from time to time as long as you're not outside and have the food turn to frozen in the San Bruno polar caps.
Robin L.,San Francisco  CA,12,333,207,1/13/2008,3.0,The reason I come here is for the drinks. When you have plans with others and they want to head over to tanforan  get a quick drink or pitcher. It makes it more fun shopping. Been here a couple times  service depends on the staff. Sometimes we get excellent friendly service  and sometimes it's the worst. The waiter takes everyones order but yours and walks away  then realizes later that they forgot to take your order.  The food here sucks  taste like every other franchise food place. Nothing special. Skip your meal and just get drinks. But the dessert pizookie is a must have
Scott C.,San Diego  CA,0,8,,3/14/2014,1.0,I think this is the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. It was over 30 minutes before I had a drink in front of me. After the food was served we had to ask for silverware and plates after the food was served. We had to go to the bar to order the second round of drinks. A third round of drinks was never offered at the table. While watching college basketball the tv spontaneously changed to another channel. At one point 7 of 10 TVs showed the Minnesota vs Michigan hockey game  none were playing the local Sharks game. The food came to the table and then turned around because they didn't have a table stand for the pizza. The second round of chips and salsa we asked for never arrived. I would have liked a third drink and it was never even offered. My water was never refilled. I will not ever return to this location and can't imagine I would ever trust another BJ's. Next time I'll go to Applebee's or something  and I can't eat anything on that menu.
JessePanda C.,San Francisco  CA,1291,369,16101,2/23/2010,4.0,"i always order my ""OLD FASHIONED POT ROAST"" man  its the bomb... ate it once and i always love it... customer service is ok  i won\'t blame it when its busy but im full everytime im out of this place... love the vibe and the atmosphere..."
Tara W.,San Bruno  CA,10,11,,5/17/2010,3.0,BJ's is a place I have gone to quite a few times  in both  a small group or an after work dinner with my entire team. Pizza  well they do have GREAT PIZZA! And well their Chicken Fried Steak is great and enough for two  just remember to ask for extra gravy!! I have had a wide variety of food choices and can't remember one that I didn't like. Beer here is pretty good too  I am a stout girl myself   so sorry that is all I can judge. But  the reason I am starting this is because they must have quick turnover on their waitstaff. I can't ever remember seeing the same person in there twice and on my visit on Friday for lunch with two coworkers one of us received their soup (for the soup/sandwich combo) WAY before the other and we couldn't find our waiter in the mean time. I just thought of that is very odd! Granted  I will be going there again!
Jenn M.,Daly City  CA,0,4,,7/25/2011,1.0,The only reason I give this place one star is because their food is sooo good but the wait staff is crap. The first time my husband and I had a bad experience with our un-attentive waiter it took forever to get plates for our appetizers and our dishes were starting to take over our table and food kept getting brought out. We even piled our plates real high and placed on the edge of the table to see if our waiter or ANYONE would notice. Nope. My husband was pissed that all these waiters kept walking by and not picking up dishes he had to actually get up and place it on a table behind him. we let it slide and went back another time. Another time our waitress was more attentive to the table of six behind us. Our last time our waitress was moody and it took her twenty minutes to bring out two waters and a lemonade for my son. Then our food is brought to us by our food runner and we needed a few things. Our waitress was no where to be found. Tried flagging down other waiters and they just quickly walked by our tables as if they didn't notice us. Then a waitress shows up at our table and informs us that she will be taking care of us while our other waitress went on a fifteen. So our waitress was acting like a huffy little bitch because she was due for a break. As we were walking to our car we vowed to never come back to this place. Deep dish pizza.... I will miss you
Sal T.,San Mateo  CA,0,15,2,11/1/2010,1.0,I have gone once before - and it was good. A little pricey but worth it. I went back recently - only to be snubbed. My girlfriend and I went to try and eat there - I guess they just didn't want my money. I say this because we never got any service. Not even a drink order. For a franchise this is a carnal sin - regardless of how busy you are. Checking. On. Your. Tables. Is. Key. I think it will be quite some time before before I waste more of mine here again.
Sal L.,Dublin  CA,136,47,9,3/15/2010,4.0,You can never go wrong with there deep dish pizza  good beer  and a pozookie for dessert to top it off.
Janelle H.,Santa Barbara  CA,818,324,586,3/14/2006,3.0,Nice restaurant  sports bar-like  but family attractive! Tvs are everywhere  so you don't have tot alk to your date! but...if u want to...its cozy and warm. they have chicago deep dish pizzas that are sizzling good. and for dessert...their famous pizookie! hot fresh baked cookie with a cool scoop of ice cream on top! way to finish your meal. service is a little slow.
Carol Y.,San Francisco  CA,442,941,515,12/21/2006,3.0,not that great and not that bad either.if i was to wait for a long time to eat  i rather go to cheesecake factory but Bj's is definitely a great place for beer and sports!
Samantha L.,San Francisco  CA,665,923,1930,6/30/2007,3.0,The atmostphere is nice and the service is good but the food is only mediocre. The pizookies are tasty but not all it's hyped up to be.
Darius A.,San Bruno  CA,29,617,34,6/6/2009,3.0,I went here a few months ago and I cannot see what all the hype is about. I can get a better pizza at Costco for 2 bucks. The service kind of sucks and the food is overrated.
Donna S.,San Carlos  CA,12,297,,5/22/2009,1.0,"This review is based on my one and only experience at any BJ\'s  granted this was awhile ago. Went with some friends and we ordered a pizza. The thing came and we are eating it and everyone is looking at each other  and finally someone copped to ""it\'s not cooked!"". The dough was quite raw  despite the fact that from the top it looked ok. So we sent it back  and the kicker is when they brought it back  it was still not cooked  still raw dough! Yuck. And they didn\'t really apologize or take it off the bill or anything. Horrible."
Peter T.,Daly City  CA,0,8,,7/22/2010,2.0,Has gone downhill over the past year or so. Last two times were not good. Had the Pizza but both times under cooked and not very tasty. Might be good for the fun and drinks but don't go for the pizza!
Nelson W.,San Francisco  CA,145,359,132,11/22/2006,3.0,OK  so when I see a new brewery  whether it is in a mall next to Barnes and Noble or on a corner in the Haight  I generally get kind of fired up. I was fired up when I saw this place on the way back from a long trip to Lowe's. After all it was 5pm on a Saturday and we had to eat *something*...(Translation  this place is in a mall next to a Barnes and Noble in San Bruno)We walked into this place  and for those who haven't seen it  it is a large restaurant room with a large bar area. The bar has a massive TV screen that generally has ESPN or some other sports related thing on it. The screen is big enough that there can be 4 different TV channels on it at the same time. So far so good.They have a full bar  and 5-6 micro brews (house beers). Check.We order beers  and get the small novel that they call a menu. Typical stuff  upscale for an Applebee's would be my best description. Burgers  salads  sandwiches. They also have pizza.We got the beer  it was fine. Nothing to write home about  but not Bud-Light-Ice-Dry--Ice-with-lime either. Ordered the bbq chicken pizza. It was pretty good. It was very good.The service was decent  but they were definitely busy. We had to wait a bit for the check. In short  you could worse for a meal  but better is definitely a possiblity as well.I had the Jeremiah Red  which was kinda sweet. The Porter is my favorite.
Stephanie K.,San Francisco  CA,29,53,23,7/21/2009,2.0,Sucks the soul from your body and stuffs it full of baked potatoes and pizookies.
Christina D.,Belmont  CA,28,242,,1/3/2010,3.0,Usually I don't go into Bj's very often but recently came in because I got a gift card. I ended up coming in for happy hour and the food tasted pretty good and didn't hurt my stomach like it used to. We got 3 mini-pizzas  chicken wings and 5 beers for about 45. Not bad!!! Can't see myself turning into a regular but probably will be back for happy hour.
Dessa S.,San Francisco  CA,8,95,43,3/25/2010,4.0,I actually really like the food here. It's like an upscale chili's. also it's nice to come here to eat after spending a couple hours shopping in the mall. Their food is really tasty. the only thing is that the root beer isn't all you can drink which sucks because it's YUMMY  I'm a big root beer fan!
Hazel S.,Dallas  TX,2,54,8,3/21/2010,5.0,I've been here quite a few times and the food has always been fantastic. I'm absolutely in love with their gourmet mac and cheese. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but every time that we've been told its 45-50 minutes  we always get a table before 30 minutes has gone by. Every server we've had has been polite  fast  funny and gotten everything right. We've also done take out a few times and that's been great as well. I've never had the beer here but I like how they have pepsi instead of coke :)
Donna A.,Daly City  CA,26,49,4,2/19/2009,3.0,this location is sort of a hit or miss kinda deal. i had actually come during the dry run  when they first opened because my friends sister was one of the servers there (free food aint bad at all!) and the service was great. but  it seems like the service during more recent visits havent been up to par. i mean  i know that it gets busy  but waiting 10 minutes for water is ridiculous. maybe it's just me  but when i ask for a water with lemon  i kind of expect a water with lemon? i get a glass of luke warm water with 2 ice cubes and no lemon (i even asked the server twice for a lemon  after she had dropped off my water.. and then she never never came back!)well  dehydration aside  the food is never a let down. the cobb salad is delish! i've also sampled a few of their pizza's  but my favorite is the great white. and who can say no to the pazookie? so  bottom line: come for the food  not for the service...
K Dizzle C.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,9/9/2012,1.0,"Second time here and had an even worse experience than before. Shame on me for thinking otherwise  I guess.We were sat down promptly  as it wasn\'t busy when we got there  but then our server disappears for 20 minutes. Finally  she comes around and gets our appetizers jotted down along with our pizza order. Then  a new waiter shows up and informs us that he would be taking over our table. Ok  that\'s fine  I think to myself  but then our pizza shows up before several of our appetizers and different waiters brought out each dish! So now we wait another 25 minutes before we see the second guy that helped us again and had to ask another waiter in the area to get him for us  and all he had to say was ""you ordered something else?"" We finally got our last appetizer after we had finished the others and the pizza  but of course it was already cold from sitting on a counter somewhere for too long. AND he forgot to refill our drinks after asking him TWICE.It wasn\'t even busy  but there was disoreintation amongst the staff that affected the quality of service to the point of a bad experience. As for the food  the pizza tastes exactly like Pizza Hut but with a premium price tag (no sauce  just cheap cheese and low grade meat on bland crust) and the mozzerella sticks leave a film in your mouth with a bad aftertaste. The beer is good though  I\'ll give them that."
DON G.,Eureka  CA,21,24,,3/25/2009,1.0,This particular one is WACK!.. my friends and I had to wait 2 hours for a seat!.. we could have called in to make reservations but they do not take phone reservations!
Ryo S.,San Jose  CA,35,172,16,10/8/2006,3.0,I love some of their own beer. The food tastes ok and they give you big portions. BJ's is where I go to when I have a sudden craving for grilled food or I need to watch some major sport event on a big screen. (Any suggestion for other places with big screen in the neighborhood? Shoot me a message!)
kristen b.,San Francisco  CA,118,87,14,10/28/2006,4.0,Don't hate me for liking BJ's. Come here for happy hour. It's great. The appetizers are such a deal at 1/2 price. The beer sampler is too - equal to about 3 beers. Great for watching sports on the many big screens. The mini pizzas are also 1/2 price. I really like BJ's pizza. The crust is soft and thick. The pepperoni comes with diced tomatoes. Lovely. The pizookies are delightful. A hot  fresh baked cookie in your choice of flavor(s) with a scoop of ice cream on top - how is that wrong? The salads are ok. They're also extremely large. Almost too large. The chicken tenders are yummy. A nice  seasoned  crunchy outside coating and tender  juicy chicken inside. MMmmmmm. I always get excited when I can convince people to come with me to BJ's and prove to them that it's really not that bad.
Amber G.,Campbell  CA,14,180,2,3/13/2007,4.0,I like BJs Brewery. Their food is good and service is usually pretty friendly as well. We've been several times and usually we get a table right away.My son loves their kid's menu...although he usually only orders the Mac&Cheese. My husband's fav? The Meatloaf or Meatball sandwich. (I forget the name).I have two favorites: I like getting the Salad/Baked Potato combo: Caesar salad and Broccoli Chicken Potato. They even let me order this after 4 pm! Usually they only offer this for lunch  but everytime I've ordered it at night  they give it to me--no problem!My other fav? The Buffalo Chicken Pizza (Mini). Aaahh! Delicious! Pefect mix of Buffalo and Ranch! Be sure you order Ranch on the side as well for a few extra calories!Oh! The Chocolate Chip Cookie! We had a birthday girl last night and so they brought us one to share! I think my son ate most of it! Ooops! I don't blame him! Fresh Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream melting on top? My little idea of HEAVEN!**CAUTION** I give this restaurant 4 stars because of that stupid hardwood floor! I almost break my neck each time I've been there trying to get into the bathroom! I slip and slide all over the place! I have to take little tiny baby steps to make sure I get there in one piece! Make sure you hold onto the handrail! Be VERY careful when you are on this floor...unless you are wearing sneakers! They need more handrails and signs posted if they are going to keep such a dangerous floor! YIKES!
Henry L.,Renton  WA,82,84,12,7/5/2007,3.0,All that hype about this place.Once you've been here you'll be reminded of all the other places. such as TGIF. Food is what you can expect  it's good  but it's not extraordinary good......especially for the 2 hour wait. The pizza was good  but still not worth the 2 hour wait.I think we ate more waiting at the bar area  eating appitizers  which was tasty as well  but not super good.3 stars  subtract two for the wait and the variety of food that long of a wait.
Mark L.,Newark  CA,6,37,,10/15/2007,3.0,Came here to watch some Sunday football since Jack's in Fremont was packed with a huge wait. Immediately went to the bar and they didnt even have the Raiders game on. I know im on the peninsula but isnt this the bay area. After i asked for the raider game they put it on the small tv and left the Pats Cowboys game on the big screen. Ridiculous....but there beers are good  and i highly reccomend the honey mustard chicken salad. Yes  its your typical chain restaurant food  but for the most part their food is well prepared and they have good service.
Chris B.,Burlingame  CA,391,317,75,8/19/2009,3.0,Great beers on tap here... Food is mediocre  I consider it to be just like fast food except its not fast at all. Service is even slower than the food. Anytime I come here though I have at least a nibble of an avocado roll and wash it down with a raging rhino red.
John M.,Pacifica  CA,0,7,,8/17/2010,3.0,This place is good for your typical 'I want a step up from fast food but don't want to pay for a french restaurant' meal. The service is hit and miss  some days it's flat out slow and sloppy  others you have one person who is really attentive. I like their pizza. More specifically  I like the great white. That's the only one that really stands out  the rest are kind of mundane as though they're the same as you can get anywhere else. I like their pasta's a lot. I like the cajun pasta and get it extra spicy. The grilled chicken pasta (with the alfredo and broccoli) is really good too. The beer is pretty good. I like the jeremiah red and the porter best. It's not brewed there which I was sad to find out  but it's still good. Overall I like this place and have no real complaints. There's just nothing really special that stands out about it.
Kimberly S.,San Francisco  CA,350,158,44,2/15/2009,4.0,I think it helps that their Strawberry Lemonade has complimentary refills. But their food is pretty damn awesome. Big portions for a girl my size. But just perfect for an average man. My friends and I come here just to hang and eat. Pizzas...entrees...PIZOOKIE. But make sure you don't eat too much  so you have room for that pizookie. Their food is pretty damn filling  in general. So you'd need to make room for a cookie measuring about 5 inches in diameter with two scoops of ice cream...my mouth is watering just thinking of it.
Duelcitizen B.,San Francisco  CA,4,3,,5/7/2013,1.0,I NEVER REALLY WRITE REVIEWS UNLESS IT'S NEEDED... I am very disappointed in this location! I was out celebrating with a friend yesterday May 6 around 6pm. I ordered an drink with alcohol and my waiter said he needed to take my driver's license to his manager to double check it because it's an out of state license. He brings my drivers license back to me bent completely in half! I ask him what happened and he said he didn't know the process but  that's how the manager checks the driver's licenses. He bends them in half. I am from out of state in school here. I will not be back home until this semester ends! What if he broke it. It would not be easy to acquire a new one being here in California. This business needs a machine or another way. I got no apology and I was treated as if it was nothing and no thought. I am very displeased about this service. I will take my complaint up the chain of command. Now I have a bent up card that will now not last nearly as long as it should.
Riza I.,Pacifica  CA,0,11,,7/26/2012,3.0,I went to BJs yesterday for my brother's birthday. I thought the food was pretty good however  the wait was longer than what they had expected and I felt like we were waiting a long time to get our food as well as any refill we needed on drinks. To me  customer service is of big importance and I thought their customer service was just okay. I was also surprised to find out that we had to wait about 45 minutes for baby back ribs to be ready because they ran out. I'm just thinking if you know that there if that is one of your best selling dishes  you should be able to compensate for this. My brother had to change his order since he didn't want to wait but he should have just ordered the baby back ribs anyways since the wait for the rest of the food was about that long too.
Theary K.,Oakland  CA,41,139,3,9/21/2007,3.0,I never sat anywhere else inside of BJ but their bar area  nor have I ever ordered any entree items. I'm writing a review for this place because I like their appetizers :D My first time at BJ  I was taken by their chicken wings! It was yummy; cripsy but not dry at all. It was the only chicken wings I would crave. However  there was one time that the wings came out horrible. I guess a change of chef or just a bad day. It tasted like frozen wings that you over microwaved (and trust me! I know how that taste). But other times  it's became good again(although not as yummy as my first time luck of the draw). I like their pizzas (1/2 off the minis during happy hours) and can't go wrong with the spinach and artichoke dip!It's a good place to go have your beer and good pub food to hold it down. Their happy hour specials are pretty descent; I can't complain.Don't have much to yelp about their beer selection. They do have their house brews with cute names  but a beer is a beer anywhere :)BJs statisfy my craving for beer and chicken wings. I'm happy (and so is my tummy). Writing this review is making me a little thirsty ;)
Zell C.,San Francisco  CA,71,423,23,12/13/2005,3.0,On a Friday night  the wait was 45 minutes for 2. WOW! But since it was my first time at the newly renovated Tanforan  we spent those 45 minutes roaming around the mall like pubescents. \r The food was okay  but nothing special. My portion of pasta was big enough for two meals. The beer was good. I was surprised that the service was pretty attentive  considering how packed the place was. I loved the chocolate chip pazookie (??) with ice cream on top---which was probably the highlight of my meal. \r Overall  nothing really impressed me to make me want to come here often.
Kel S.,San Francisco  CA,119,290,42,3/9/2007,3.0,Ever since this place opened up in Tanforan  the establishments around this area seemed to get hipper. However  for whatever reason  this BJ's is still a notch below the BridgePoint one in Foster City.At this BJ's  you get everything you expect from a large-scale restaurant operation: good food  nice portions  friendly wait staff  and cool amenities (awesome bar for watching the game). The menus are the same at every BJ's  so here are our top picks: Sante Fe Salad  Avocado Egg Rolls  Halibut Fish Tacos  Sourdough Burger  ALL of its Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas  and of course  the Pizookie-- a freshly baked cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream. With all of this being said  you do NOT come to BJ's if you're watching your weight.The only grip we have about this particular BJ's is their service. It's very inconsistent. We hypothesize that it depends on the hour you dine  but it seems like whenever we go to the BJ's in Foster City  the staff is more attentive and responsive.
Jon D.,Hayward  CA,34,142,,7/26/2007,3.0,Setting: I dunno  I've come here quite a few times  and it's getting less and less well kept. The place is starting to smell humid  like old wet mops that's been used over and over. The ramp going up to the bar area is slippery. At least the restroom is still clean. But if you're there with the guys to watch sports  you probably wouldn't care about the smell. Lots of TVs to watch your favorite teams. Still a fun atmosphere.Food: The burgers aren't bad at all. I've tried the Sourdough burger and the Crispy Chicken burger...very good. Price is pretty cheap...~$12/pp.Service: The wait can get pretty long. It's a mall afterall  it can get very busy. But once you're seated  you get full attention from the waiters. They are very nice  always attentive.
Michelle W.,Daly City  CA,215,280,4,8/13/2007,2.0,I do not understand why this place is ever packed or why people would wait here. The only reason I would come back to this place is for their Pizookie. Everything else there is pretty crappy.I came here for my dear Erica's birthday. It was a Sunday and we had to wait despite a reservation. The beers kept us busy and they were good. When we finally got seated  we got a chance to order. I couldn't decide what to get because nothing was appealing. I finally decided on a chicken tender sandwich with fries. It was small and measly and $9 (so NOT worth it). I would recommend that you come here if you like to waste your precious money on subpar overpriced food.
Elyn S.,San Francisco  CA,3,22,,8/25/2007,4.0,I've ended up going to BJ's a couple of times with different people  and I have to admit I've always had a really good time.Maybe I've been lucky  but I've also always had good service  including quick with the drinks. I like their Brewhouse Blonde and the Berry Blast Cider (that last one is a first for me  I don't usually get sweet drinks). Both served nice and cold.I usually get the fish and chips  beer battered. They've always done a good job on the fish  not overcooked and dry. Nice and moist.Their warm chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream was really good.And the bathroom was clean... always a plus.
Lily T.,San Francisco  CA,128,206,11,9/13/2007,3.0,Food there is alrite.. first time going there.. i ordered a mini dish pizza.. when it came.. i put pepper suddenly the cap fell out and pepper spilled all over my pizza... luckily the waiter saw it and he said he get me a new one... yippee... remember doing the same trick at a pizza joint.. who know..? it might happen to u one day....their alcohol is kool  one tastes like root beer..
Angelina M.,Allen  TX,171,258,43,1/25/2009,4.0,Went in today with the boyfriend and monster. I had the California chicken sanwich. Very tasty. I wished there had been some lettuce on it but o well. 5 starts b/c my son was at ease enjoyed his food and did not scream or throw anything. 1 star off b/c the last 3 times I had been in there was a hair in my cesaer salad. Why I feel the need to come back after 3 hairs...oatmeal raisen pizookie.
Larry W.,San Francisco  CA,30,62,6,10/18/2009,4.0,"We went to BJ\'s in order to watch a football game that our cable was not showing. We got exactly what we wanted: plenty of table space (for the early game)  good service  good beer and some snack food. Their food is not gourmet but you know that going in. It is in a mall  what do you want? If you are on a diet  this is not your place. There is no organic anything and their ""diet"" menu is nothing to brag about  like a wedge of iceberg lettuce with some dressing. We knew all this so we were not disappointed. Their beer is always good. Our server (Matt) was great & the orders came quickly. They made every attempt to keep the table clear and the kids happy. Too bad my NY Giants lost! Thanks BJ\'s for a good morning of football."
Dan L.,Eden Prairie  MN,0,60,,2/28/2012,3.0,Frustrating restaurant. Sometimes the service is good and other times  just terrible. The food is usually good  or at least what comes out is what was ordered  but occasionally  the food is just not good. Their clam chowder is usually great. They have some great prices on lunch items. I work nearby and come fairly often  so I guess there has to be some misses when you come here a lot  but when this place misses  it seems to miss by a lot. But I will return.
Annette C.,Fremont  CA,0,5,,6/26/2012,1.0,The worst. I had suggested it because the BJs in Newark is ok but the service was S.L.O.W! It was clear when the food came that at least MY food had been ready of a LOOOOONG time and had sat under a heat lamp. YUCK. Chicken tacos had become chicken jerky shoe leather tacos. I was embarrassed. We were on the way to airport or I would have sent everything back and gone somewhere else. Avoid it.
Kiki W.,Brisbane  CA,0,4,,8/2/2010,4.0,Always a good place to go  with friends or alone. Can be crowded  so we try to come during happy hour. Nothing beats their Berry Cider and Avocado Egg Rolls  but everything else I ever had there was good too.
K C.,San Francisco  CA,0,9,,6/7/2012,2.0,Always a long wait to be seated  the service is never great. The food is ... ok? ... =/ Never a first choice but it's convenient.
Carolyn H.,Los Angeles  CA,26,61,1,10/21/2006,5.0,Beer samplers and kick-ass deep dish pizza - just a BART ride away. Heaven. Just Heaven.
Justin L.,Daly City  CA,189,150,1,2/26/2007,3.0,FRIED FOOD....Ok  so I should have had a little more input on the food i was consuming during my friends' bday celebration  but we ended up with the awesome blossom like onion appetizer  buffalo chicken wing pizza  and artichoke chip dip. The server was great  she was the most friendly person I encountered during that day  so hats off to the wait staff. My suggestion is salad if you go to BJ's
Vicky T.,San Francisco  CA,3,12,,1/26/2010,3.0,BJ's favorite is my all-time favorite here. I don't really come here for anything else because everything else is so greasy! Service is good  but sometimes you have to wait a while before your waiter finally gets to you.
tina b.,San Bruno  CA,0,12,,5/31/2012,1.0,Will not return; once again  last evening waited over 90 minutes for a table  only to leave without eating. Too long of a wait; impossible to get into the bar and sit. When we decided we had enough  we gave up and handed the pager back to the reservation desk girls. They never apologized for the wait; nor asked us to stay; it was just 2 less patrons that they would have to deal with. Never again  will we go back there. It does not matter if it is 1:00 PM in the afternoon or 8:30 PM at night. They could of doubled the space of this restaurant  and it still wouldn't of been enough to accomodate. This was a total BJ alright.
Mochi M.,San Jose  CA,245,81,,7/24/2011,3.0,blah. everything was too slow. i didnt get my drink til late because our waitress assumed that sum1 brought it out. I dont mind much because it wasnt THAT long. food tasted good  service was alright. pizookie made me fat. hahaha good place to chill though. HELLA busy but the noise level was good. i was able to hear my friend . hahaha so yea  i'll come back.
Champ F.,San Francisco  CA,0,36,,3/21/2010,3.0,Food was good. Service was somewhat OK  but a little on the pricey side.
Suelene C.,Irvine  CA,370,76,11,10/17/2010,4.0,LOVE BJ's! Happy hour is great too! PAZOOKIES!!!! all i can say is YUM! They are BOMB! And they have great beer as well. Their pizzas are really good too especially their deep-dish ones. Service is usually pretty good. The atmosphere is nice too  dimly lit  with usually 4-5 Big LCD TV monitors with the games on and an open bar area. The wait however can be a long one. So come early. The place is loud  not a really listener-friendly area if you're trying to REALLY get to know somene. Overall is a great place and is fun to be in too.
Maulie D.,San Francisco  CA,108,206,1,9/5/2008,3.0,BJ's serves up some great American food. Pizza  Pasta  Salads  Burgers  and full American dinners make up this solid menu that will definitely please a picky crowd. It's the deep dish  comfort food version of CPK.
Sang K.,San Francisco  CA,12,22,3,9/26/2007,3.0,"Maybe its the \'tard in me  but I laugh every time someone says ""BJ\'s"" So with that said  I chucked to myself as I entered through the doors of the newly remodeled Tanforan Shopping Center. They did a good job fixing up the mall  although the hoodlums still gather during school time and even more so after school. The restaurant was pretty clean although I don\'t care for the all stainless steel bathroom stalls and sinks. Its just too industrial  hard to clean and reminds me of jail. Jail is Bad!~Being the beer aficionado that my toilet could vouch for  I had to try as many different beers as I could before heading back to work (my previous employer who didn\'t really know how I spent my 3 hour lunch breaks). The Harvest Hefeweizen was clean and crisp and even more refreshing with extra lemon. The Brewhouse Blonde was also light and tasty. The Jeremiah Red was full flavored and had a very strong kick. The Totonka Stout is fun to say  but difficult to drink. Its pretty much a generic/wannabe Guinness  but I still was able to finish my pint. Beer is Good!~ As for food  I tried the Lunch Special half turkey sandwich and salad. Nothing special  just a plain turkey-lettuce-bread and plain garden salad. On my next visit  I did try their Roast Beef Dip Sandwich which I did really like. The horseradish they give you on the side is a good compliment and helps you drink more beer. Again  beer is Good!~I sat at the bar the times I\'ve been there. That cuts down on the time the beer has to travel from tap to table. There are huge HD screens near the bar but don\'t ask them to change the channel  they don\'t know how.  The waitresses seem like the typical ditsy \'oh my god\' girls who would work in a place called BJ\'s. I know  I don\'t know them  I shouldn\'t judge them... let me drink more beer so I can justify my opinions more. Lastly  beer is Great!~"
Jenny A.,Daly City  CA,1,10,,5/2/2012,1.0,My husband and I use to frequent this restaurant quite often. However  in the past couple of years the food quality has gone down hill. We would often order deep dish pizzas. The food would be delivered lukewarm with a thin layer of tomato sauce to cover the dough. The cheese would barely be melted and the crust would not be cut all the way through. For all these reasons  we have stopped eating at this restaurant.
Kevin C.,Millbrae  CA,87,68,,7/21/2008,3.0,Well  This place is always a default place for me to go when theres nothing really better to do but it does have a lot of good points. Since its a Brewery they only carry their own brand of beer. If ya wanna get a buzz going on try the Jerimiah Red have like two or three of thoes and whew your are feeling pretty good. I'm stuck on the crispy chicken sandwichw/ a side of ranch for the fries. I normally get the Blonde or Heff brew.....mmmmm delicious ! Staff for the most part is friendly  except for the weekends they tend to get a little rude. Always a cool place for friends. Sports always on  and beer always fresh  and a good time comes for about $19.00-$35.00.
T L.,San Jose  CA,10,38,9,2/2/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Thank you for making my gfs most horrible. Serving cold food and passing it off as new is bad business. No one wants someone else go-back. Shame shame on you BJs
charlotte s.,Stavanger  Norway,93,1233,31,4/19/2009,3.0,were in the area and didn't feel like eating at the food court so came here... had to wait a while for a table. i think it was friday afternoon so there were some company group luncheons here and there in the dining room...service was decent to minimal... had some pasta dish  which was ok.... if i had a choice between going to this chain or a cheesecake factory  i'd probably chose cheesecake factory....
Joey J.,South San Francisco  CA,0,2,,4/12/2012,2.0,Food was ok. Service well... The problem I had was when we finished our soups  nobody got our soup bowls from our table. Two of us ordered Tortilla soup and you know how big those soup bowls are. The main dish was served but the soup bowls were not taken away. When I asked our server to remove the empty plates he sure didn't appreciate my request.
Tiffanie L.,Daly City  CA,1,22,,4/12/2010,4.0,It's always seem to be a wait when dining at this restaurant. This place sure has great food. We order artichoke dip  hot wings and also pulled pork bbq burger. It sure took them quite a bit of time to make. I guess they were a bit busy or short handed. Service is not too bad  it's hard to even the drink refilled. I also try their root beer float- no complaint there. Good price and good food.
Mimi S.,Colma  CA,35,170,79,4/27/2009,4.0,Food was great and inexpensive. Love the vibe there  but our waiter (forgot homeboy's name)  tapped me and asked what I would like to drink. Maybe it was an accident  but I thought that was kinda weird. N e ways  the service was great. I barely ate my meal bc of the large pizza and appetizer we ordered mmm mmmm mmmm so YUMMY. Minus one star bc the table we got was pretty small. There were 4 men and 3 woman in our party. And ladies we know how men like to sit  with their legs wide open and elbows stretched out WTF? yea so not enough table space for the food and the men to spread their legs and elbows. Overall BJ I think is better than TGIF.
Allie M.,Northridge  CA,149,21,1,6/3/2009,5.0,5 stars for the service. The waiter misheard my colleague's order  apologized  had the manager apologize  offered soup until her order was ready  brought out her dish 4 minutes later  and took all of her purchases off the bill. Everyone at the table left happy. (plus the food was good! i recommend anything that is served with french fries!)
Brian R.,San Francisco  CA,14,84,29,5/25/2011,3.0,ok food  good price  lunch deal is pretty good  got the clam chowder was so so  garden salad could have been better  peachberry tea tasted like medicine  overall 3 stars is being nice  probably closer to 2 and a half
Krissel A.,Pacifica  CA,98,52,4,7/9/2009,3.0,This place is alright. I come here with my friends when we all want dinner together. We normally get a pizza & a pizookie. Good stuff. The service sucks. The wait sucks even more. The wait really depends on what time you go. But if you have your buzzer thing  be careful when you walk around Tanfo. It might lose signal (Treat it like a ghetto cell phone. You can't go far without losing signal.) & you'll end up waiting another (insert wait period here) minutes/hour(s). Don't be too frustrated at the end when your server doesn't come back with the check for awhile. Enjoy your time chatting with your buds. Other than that  everything's alright.
Ali F.,Millbrae  CA,2,20,,3/24/2010,4.0,The food is average (what do you really expect from a chain?)  but BJ's is a great place for groups as the menu is extensive. Sure to have something for everyone.Also  on nice days it is fun to sit outside and taste a bunch of different beers.
Christopher C.,Redwood Shores  CA,53,135,65,9/15/2007,3.0,BJ's is a chain  it is good decent pub fair. the pizzas have stewed tomatoes on them  it's their thing. I don't really like that much  but you know  it's okay food and I will keep coming back for more. on the plus side  the smiley face fries and pazookie are fun to eat.yes but being a beer guy  I come for the beer. their heff is decent  most of the brews are tasty.. it varies with each batch like small brews will. i will let you in on a secret. MIX THEM!not on the menu... but describe it and they will do it.Black and Brown - PM porter and Nutty BrewnetteJeremiah Blonde - Brewhouse Blonde and Jeremiah Redyay!if you don't really like the food  just sit at the bar  eat appetizers and drink up. They have TV's all over so if you like sports thats great. I am not really into watching pompous millionaires play a half-ass game of whatever * ..but to each his own.. most the BJs have DirecTV so they play Fuel  Speed  and the more interesting sports..Each BJ's has a different atmosphere  if you don't like San Bruno  try Foster City or one of the ones that actually brews the beer on site. good for groups if you pick one that has a separate party/meeting room. Not all of them do!
Bill D.,San Bruno  CA,0,74,6,9/16/2011,2.0,I dined at the bar for years  and enjoyed an exceptional staff. The food was fair  and the beer was good. I was always shocked when I would go for table service  because it was consistently bad. Then...the bar staff changed and deteriorated. Management is clueless! I don't go there anymore.
Lady O.,San Diego  CA,8,66,,11/30/2008,1.0,why is it when it comes to BJ  their service have never surprise me to resonate ALL of BJ's like in Cupertino and San Bruno.service is horrible as usual with their cheapness to employ more staff but i am a sucker for their thin crust appy pizza and avocado rolls.
Sarah D.,Seattle  WA,91,165,334,12/30/2008,3.0,On the prawl for new brews to try...from their website this place looks totally corporate. Like the Chilis of brewhouses. Even Pyrimid looks/is better. Before I totally slam them I must go and submit an update. But based on principal and the fact that my 3 stars wont hurt their score much I will end it at that.
Annie D.,Sunnyvale  CA,353,740,191,2/18/2009,4.0,This normally isn't the first place I would choose to come eat at  but this place is pretty decent. I always go to the bar seating area  most of the time you'll have to hunt for a seat. Service has it's ups and downs  sometimes they're on it and sometimes they forget about you. I'm a fan of their deep dish pizzas. I always ask for extra toppings and there's never a charge and it does come out with extra toppings! Their huge stuffed potatoes are pretty good. Spinach dip and fresh chips is a great appetizer. Their fish tacos are surprising very tasty. Their beer is good  I'm a dark beer drinker so I always get their Tatonka stout. And of course for dessert  the famous pizookie never fails  warm chocolate cookie or white chocolate with melting ice cream on top  can't go wrong with that simple dessert or entree for some..
Scarlett C.,San Francisco  CA,0,21,3,3/1/2010,5.0,BJ's is always a safe bet. They have great food and drinks and I come here often since there is so much variety I don't get sick of it. The only complaint I have is that it's always so crowded that I end up waiting 45 minutes to get seated....but it's honestly worth it since there isn't a whole lot of options around this area for good food and beer. I would LOVE if another BJ's opened up nearby in Millbrae  Burlingame or South City just so the customers could be more spread out and I wouldn't have to wait 45 minutes for a table.
Sonlay V.,Southern California  CA,221,906,283,6/7/2009,4.0,I was so surprised when I found out they brew their own brewery. I tried a Blonde and damn it was good. I liked the environment because it was big and had man TVs. I did feel like it was the same layout as an Aber and Fitch or a Holister store  but it was nice. Food wasn't bad and I would definitely come back for another Blonde.
Tahoe N.,South San Francisco  CA,70,9,2,4/4/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"I went back recently  and tried a Belgian beer on their list. One word  ""Wow!"" was my description of the beer. I don\'t remember which one I got  but it was 12% and very tasty! Malty  spicy  hoppy  everything you love in a Belgian beer/ ale."
Joelle L.,San Jose  CA,147,68,11,9/27/2008,2.0,I came here last night with my boyfriend  my friend & a bunch of his friends just to hang out. God  they need to turn up the heaters outside because SSF is freezing! Anyway  we were all just hanging out outside & talking. Ended up getting a few drinks because wasn't feeling beer at all at the moment. This is the first time I got mixed drinks from BJ's & I was disappointed. My boyfriend first got me an adios & it tasted so watered down. Then i ordered a Tokyo Tea. Tasted way too syrupy. I just finished it because I didn't wanna waste my boyfriend's money on it. At least my friend's watermelon margarita was good. I think I'd only go here to eat & drink their beer  not for their mixed drinks.
Nicole S.,San Bruno  CA,0,15,,12/1/2007,4.0,I've been to BJ's three times  and each time it was a great experience. My best friend and I went on a Friday night and only had to wait about 25 minutes for a table (I was expecting upwards of 40). Another time I went with my Mom and brother. Again  about a 20 minute wait on a Friday night. We were given a device that would vibrate and beep when our table was ready. Family and I wandered into Barnes and Noble and shopped around for a while- and it went off in there! I'm very happy I can wander out of the restaurant without worrying if I'll lose my table or not.The food is always good. I've gotten pizza and sandwhiches  both of which have exceeded my standards. And their pazookie was amazing :-)! The waiters and waitresses and really nice and attentive. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be really noisy in there. When my family and I went we had to yell over the sound.
Customer L.,San Francisco  CA,0,14,,1/27/2012,4.0,Even though they were super busy on Sunday  the service and food was good. However  waitresses speak so FAST. Sometimes  hard to catch it up.
Jasper N.,Daly City  CA,0,4,,1/26/2012,4.0,went here for a friends birthday party. overall good food and our waiter was chill. the burgers and sandwiches are huge! i got a pulled pork and it was amazing.
Drew k.,San Diego  CA,0,40,3,7/28/2011,3.0,Food is pretty good but way overpriced. Long waits for a table or drink during weekends. Drinks are only reasonable during happy hour. Don't go here if you are on a budget. Wait staff are average but I found many of the female hostsses to be very immature and snotty. Most of the time I go  I get attitude or unfriendliness when putting my name in for a table.
Sydney S.,San Bruno  CA,3,28,,7/22/2006,3.0,"BJ\'s is one of those coporate franchises that markets the image of a micro-brewery to sell drinks and food to the 20-40 something diners. A representative customer is looking for an informal sports-bar like setting to watch the game on tvs while you have a drink or two with your friends.Ever eat anything at sports bars? Yes  the menu has items like onion flowers  avocado rolls  and nachos to start  salads  soups  so-called ""gourmet specialty"" pizzas and other staple basic entrees like pasta and meat loaf. It\'s incredibly uninspring and the prices are a little on the pricey side  albeit the fact that the portions are BIG. The service is fairly good  except that the busy waitress took the wrong order twice in a row and tried to force us to eat whatever she assumed that we ordered. Yes  I am a stupid customer who doesn\'t know what I ordered a moment before  duh!The food is mediocre and with attentive but misguided service  I would rather go and eat a slice of Costco pizza than eat here again."
stella m.,Las Vegas  NV,1,6,,9/1/2007,3.0,8/23/2007I always like coming to this place. The first place we went to right after landing at SFO. I like their avocado egg rolls. My kids like it too. The only thing that bothers me is that the usual wait for dinner would be about 50 minutes!!!! The service is good. I am sorry to hear that the someone from BJs would steal a customer's credit card. YIKES!
Chris N.,Pacifica  CA,17,7,,7/18/2011,4.0,Best named restaurant in san bruno. Food is pretty good too.
Daisy S.,Mililani  HI,53,490,196,3/1/2009,3.0,The athmosphere is good... the beer is good... but the food is average for me. Came here because it is one of the nearest places to eat outside the jacked up prices of airport food.
Ana A.,Concord  CA,2,19,,2/4/2008,4.0,I mainly come here to meet up with my girls. We sit at the same table and have drinks. Sometimes grab a meal. Every time we do come there is a wait. We usually leave and come back or sit at the bar. They also have outside seating with outdoor heaters. meals are big.. AGAIN we mostly come for the drinks and to talk where its not quiet. We are loud so it suits us.
mitchell l.,San Francisco  CA,79,76,44,1/9/2009,3.0,Nice spot to watch game's with friends. Great beers on tap and lots of choices on the grub. Foods nothing special but decent I do like the deep dish pizza  Cobb salad  and jambalaya. Place gets packed there but you may be able to find some bar tables if you are lucky and not have to wait for the vibrating pager haha. Service has always been great and the prices are very reasonable.
S F.,South San Francisco  CA,9,180,79,8/18/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Since my last review  you would of think that they will get better at this .Sorry to say my friends that nope it's not.In 3 years since my last review I went back with my brother and we got smarter this time by seated at the bar.Food is ok still and same with their drinks but I am so sorry to say that their service move in a pace of melting glacier.Sad but true.Was hoping that things will change but this wishful thinking will have to end here and now.
Neil N.,Irvine  CA,83,248,36,12/22/2008,3.0,I came here to get some food and watch the game with the guys. Unless you're sitting at the bar  the TVs aren't that helpful. They have corner TVs but they must be only 22-24 inches  and with no sound. So really  you're just eating but occasionally looking at the TV. For a place to eat while watching the game intently  go elsewhere.As for the food  it is good. We had the wings for starters and I had the BBQ chicken sandwich while my friends had the ribs and chicken fried steak. FYI  these are big portions. Luckily  I had some good brew to wash it down. Didn't realize it  but they serve pumpkin as their seasonal. I'll have to come back  as the last time I had great pumpkin beer was in Seattle. Service was a lil slower  but I suspect it was because it was a Saturday nite and there was a huge xmas shopping crowd. Still took over 10 minutes for dessert  which was the brownie by the way. Excellent brownie  but way too much whipped cream. Reminds me of the ice cream sundae Bobby on the Brady Bunch when he was competing in the ice cream eating contest! LOLOverall  probably will come back  as it's better than food court food  but will stay with 21st Amendment or Knuckles to watch the game.
Elle C.,Los Angeles  CA,18,47,5,3/5/2008,1.0,"this place is the epitome of watered-down  pasty white  blubbery  american ""culture"". i mean  if you couldn\'t guess already by these hints:1. it\'s a ""brewery"" in a ""mall"" (does tanforan really qualify as a mall?). there is a holding tank for fermenting beer stuffs  not hooked up to anything  in front of the restaurant. ""ooh! it\'s a brewery! they have one of those brewery tank thingies!""2. it\'s in san bruno. san bruno is business parks and the golden gate national cemetery - that\'s it.i wanted to sit and bask in the sun on that patio! that\'s why i did not turn around when i realized i had just stepped foot in nascar haven. and after the blase hostess said it would be a ten minute wait for a table (there was like nobody in the place) and that ""she thought"" there was a server outside so i could sit out there with no wait. it took ten minutes for the server to come out.i got the chopped italian salad with no salami (don\'t come here if you\'re a conscious eater  ie: care about organics  not eating animal products). it comes  it\'s HUGE...which supports my first paragraph. way too huge. nobody can eat that much iceberg lettuce  mealy tomatoes  canned black olives  artichoke hearts  and wishbone italian dressing. the cheese on it was those teeny-tiny squares of mozzarella  the kind that really cheap pizzerias use. i get my bill and it\'s $13; for an empty salad and an iced tea. watch though  i\'ll be back...that patio will lure me in again! it\'s the only sunny patio i can find in san bruno. next time i\'ll just drink beer and go back to work at least blurry to the fact that i had just been violated by a greasy man named bj who voted for bush both times!"
Chihiro O.,San Francisco  CA,6,22,,2/6/2007,3.0,I like there because..i like their good happy hours  two times a day.i like their friedly service.i like their beer (one kind)i don't like there because..we have to wait so long to get seated some waiters/bartenders are rude..well  however why are we keep going there like once a week?BJ is easy place to go  i mean  not too pricy not fancy  just go there to watch basketball or to have fun time with your friends.
Jen N.,Pacifica  CA,43,85,,5/12/2007,5.0,I love eating at BJs! Their Santa Fe Salad and Artichoke & Spinach pizza is the best! And I highly recommend the Nutty Brunette & Jeremiah Red beers. And make sure you save room for the Pizookie!!The only drawback is that they don't accept reservations  which sucks  especially on a weekend night because you might have to wait an hour and a half!
Stephanie D.,Millbrae  CA,1,54,4,7/18/2009,3.0,The food is typical of what you would expect in any run of the mill restaurant. The service is usually pretty good. I would recommend it and I would even give it 4 stars  expect I think it's a little pricey. Take about $3-$5 off each entree price  and I think the place would be great and I would go a lot more often. Extensive drink menu is also a plus (but again  they come with a hefty price tag).
Carlo S.,San Francisco  CA,6,29,1,8/12/2008,3.0,ok food  but the servers are mia for the most part. I had to wait about 15 mins to flag down a waitress because they did fly-by's and pretend to not look in my direction.
L.N. M.,San Bruno  CA,34,30,,6/7/2008,2.0,I don't know if it's a BJ's thing to have long wait time and lousy service -- the BJ's I used to go to in LA is just as bad.As everyone else says  the wait time is abysmal. The bar area is a great place to hang out after work -- if you can grab a table or a place at the bar. Again  be prepared to wait.The food is great though and the beer sampler is fun.
Rick G.,South San Francisco  CA,0,8,,6/7/2008,3.0,The food's not bad.Service is decent...not the most attentive or lively..seems like they just want to get out of there..but I can see why  this place gets really busy..It's just all about the pizookie! I'll be coming back for it often!
Larry L.,San Francisco  CA,17,206,2,12/27/2008,4.0,"Recommend Happy Hour! I\'ve been here many many times for happy hour and late night. Order the wings and bbq chicken pizza. Beer you gotta go for the ""Reds"" if your a dark drinker and or ""Pirana"" which is a little lighter."
Stephanie B.,San Francisco  CA,4,47,12,3/20/2011,1.0,Everytime I have come here it has been a dissapointment. I came here for my friends birthday and there were 8 of us. Of course they don't take reservations so we knew the wait was going to be long  it was 2 hours. Two hours goes by and we ask them if the table is ready and they said not yet they were waiting for our table for 8 to open up. Then another 45 minutes goes by and we finally get called. They put us at a table for 4 people and put a small table on the end. WTF??? This was they table they made us wait almost 3 hours for. So  since we were all starving and didn't want to wait any longer we decided to just order. As we all sat way too close to each other we had told the waiter it was our friend's birthday  so they would sing and make him feel special. When our food arrived it was not worth the price at all  they put way too many spices on their food. Then our drinks finally came out halfway through the meal and there was food in 2 of the 8 drinks we ordered  I don't know how they didn't see food floating in the drinks  gross. As we finished our meals we were waiting for them to bring the birthday boy his dessert  and at this time it wasn't busy at all. We kept reminding our waiter and we sat their for another 45 minutes just waiting. We decided to just leave because they obviously didn't care. As soon as we walk to the door the just handed it to him and walked away  no song or anything. An we had already left the table. This place is a huge dissapointment  and will not be getting my service anymore. The only reason they get a star out of me is because of the root beer they serve.
Michelle B.,San Francisco  CA,326,147,20,10/20/2008,4.0,This place has the best clam chowder! Their special lunch menu is the best too! You get half a sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder for around 6 bucks and that got me stuffed! Their pizza is good too  but a bit pricey. I'm definitely coming back!
Bernadette J.,Brisbane  CA,0,15,,6/2/2011,4.0,I love BJ's food and beer. Expect to wait at least 45 minutes if you show up anytime near a normal meal time. It isn't so bad though  because you can wander around the mall while you wait. Their portions are massive  so essentially all their meals are half priced too  because you get a whole extra left over meal. Also  PIEZOOKIE. Winning!
M J.,South San Francisco  CA,0,32,5,1/27/2008,1.0,"Pretty bad service. They didn\'t greet us at all. Didn\'t offer to bring drinks while we looked over our menu. Our appetizer never came. Then when it came half way through our meal it was completely the wrong thing. They didn\'t get our order right and even when it was their fault they acted like it was our fault. One time during our meal some food came to our table that we didn\'t order - not very organized. Seems like they don\'t care about getting return business because they didn\'t make us feel very welcome. It was pretty surprising that they managed to make every food completely swimming in grease -- yes  even our salad: swimming in grease.I guess since they have their own beer on-tap flowing they don\'t have to worry about keeping customers happy with their ""service."" Perhaps if we had a few beers we wouldn\'t have cared that they were so rude and slow."
Ron J.,Fremont  CA,0,2,,6/19/2008,1.0,Terrible restaurant. The food is cold and generally flavorless (as well as overpriced). The wait is typically long and the service is indifferent at best and downright rude at worst.This place will probably survive simply due to a highly desirable location. However  I'd love to see it replaced.
Kathy K.,San Francisco  CA,2,21,2,3/4/2009,4.0,one word   pizookie xD!!cookie with ice cream on top =]wut a wonderful creationi liek this place...x)
Tess E.,South San Francisco  CA,14,142,,11/30/2009,1.0,I gave this place 1 star  strictly for this location. I've been to other BJ's and have always had a pleasant experience. But I was severly disappointed when I tried this one in San Bruno (sadly since I really like BJ's otherwise). It was mainly the service that made it such a horrible experience!! We waited forever to place our drink orders  then another life time to place our actual dinner orders. We could barely seem to get our server's attention  or any server for that matter. I asked several people  including the hostess if they could find our server  only to be ignored and finally  I flagged down a manager but he was unhelpful as well. They supposedly failed to communicate that our server had gone on break but either way NO ONE was helping us and even the manager seemed unapologetic. Why did I stay for all that?? It was my sister's last night before moving out of state and it was already late so I just really wanted to have dinner (plus she hadn't tried this restaurant yet and I really wanted her to try their pizookies). Too bad her first experience was like that. It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. On the plus side (I will give them that much) I wrote a very lengthy and detailed complaint about this location on their web and I got a personal email and handwritten note from their general manager apologizing for the experience including a $25 comp card. Since this is the closest location to me  I did go back to redeem the comp card---take out of course! I wouldn't subject myself to that kind of service again!
Jody C.,San Francisco  CA,428,36,4,10/17/2008,2.0,First off this place is always busy and I can't seem to understand why because their food is GROSS. I have been here a couple of times and never by choice and every time we had to wait forever and then the food is crap. Their drinks are OK but that is all I can really say. If you have a large party good luck...you have to wait a LONG LONG time and then even with a small group of people you have to wait. I don't even get it...how does a place that doesn't taste that great have soo much people...GO FIGURE!!!
Genesis K.,San Francisco  CA,1549,17,,2/22/2009,4.0,This place is a great place to watch SPORTS! Well when bay area sports are good that is  on any night theres a big game or when the warriors are playing you have to wait at least 20-40 minutes  but other then that you got to love BJ's with its awesome root beer  and strawberry lemonade thats bottomless  you cant go wrong with bottomless drinks on top of great food  from great pasta  to great pizza  to great deserts  you got to love BJ's....When your there get their pizookie its a cookie pizza with ice cream on top which is BOMB  although you do get a stomach ache right after its worth it...Beware tho  you could easily spend 40 dollars for two people plus tip  so go there looking to spend money.
Haven L.,San Francisco  CA,0,21,,8/14/2011,5.0,Their food and environment are great! What more can you ask for besides maybe complimentary bread at the beginning? Anyway  good place to go with friends. I recommend any one of their pizzas  the chili bowl  and of course  the chocolate chip PIZOOKIE.
Takeru A.,San Ramon  CA,8,23,138,4/1/2008,3.0,The taste isn't guaranteed  and the prices are okay  but I kinda like the huge  gigantic deep dish pizza which you can share with lots of friends. When I went there  the waitress was taking her sweet time  and didn't seem to be friendly  though it's probably because it was getting late  near closing time. The atmosphere and decor is fine  and I especially like the outdoor fire pit  which can be fun and useful during winter time!
Melody M.,Glendale  AZ,7,52,5,2/7/2011,4.0,My boyfriend and I have been frequenting this Bjs for about 5 years now and the experience really varies from time to time. We've had times where everything was perfect from the hostess to waiter to food and bill.  But other times we've had horrible experiences where the food didnt come out right  took forever to replace the order  and didnt even bother to take it off the bill. Then again  those were the best and worst experiences. Usually its a decent place  great food and good service. We've order a wide range of food and drinks. We usually do our favorites such as the brewhouse nachos (my boyfriends absolute fave)  the potato skins  the tomato bisque soup  the full rack of ribs  pulled pork sandwich  the burger pizza  the grilled chicken pasta  the shrimp scampi (my favorite!)  the old fashion pot roast  the meatloaf  and lastly the pork chops. The only thing there that I dont like is the lasagna  for some reason it comes out watery looking and tasting and was just wrong all over. Oh yes  their desserts are awesome as well the pizookie is something to try =) The wait times can be long on weekends and during sporting events so do a call ahead and theyll put your name in the waitling list and by the time you arrive  youll be seated!
Florence W.,Fremont  CA,122,281,27,7/30/2008,4.0,Can I just say how fabulous their Pizookie's are?!? They are sooo yum yum in my tum tum and are baked fresh with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on them! They have multiple flavors but the best are choco chip and white choco macadamia. the best part--if you can't decide  you can get it half and half! I did that and asked for my ice cream on the side (i have this weird thing where my foods can't touch...too messy). The server  I think his name was Alex  forgot to do so and served it right on top of the pizookie. I didn't say anything because forgetfulness happens and when he realized it  he told me he'd take it off the bill. They have excellent service and didn't get mad that we just came in for pizookie's. Their pizookies are soooo fresh and can be the sweetest ending to any night!
Lindsay M.,San Francisco  CA,0,6,,9/7/2011,2.0,I like BJ's but their service isn't the greatest. They take a long time to take your order  and refill drinks. But other than that they are good. I just think they are understaffed.
Steven O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,701,1,1/31/2009,3.0,Yummy Chicago style pizza and potato skins that hit the spot everytime. The wait for a table can be a bit long but worth it when you're craving deep dish pizza. The service can also be a lot better...noticed a couple that got seated at the same time as us and still hadn't ordered while our food was coming out...needless to say  they left.
Jennifer D.,Alameda  CA,494,1692,81,3/1/2007,3.0,"I can never say the name of this place with a straight face. Because I have the maturity level of a 10 year old. But seriously  the fun is almost endless - ""How do you feel about BJs for dinner?"" ""Anyone in the mood for BJs?"" etc. My mother does not really appreciate this  and as that\'s who I\'m usually dining with when I go to BJs  well  anyway  I think it\'s funny.The food is what you\'d expect. I like it better than some other chains. I like the cute names for the beer. The pizza is decent. There are a lot of TVs. They have garage doors separating the space  and someday in a beer induced mischief session I am sure I will try to close them. I almost always slip and kill myself when walking across the hardwood floor (what do they clean that shit with  Pledge? *cough Andrea O. cough *). There are pictures of spunky half naked boys in the bathroom and it smells orangey in there. It\'s in a mall. You don\'t really need a review to know what you\'re going to get here. The pizookie is a bit quirky and I just had sliders there (yay!) so they\'re slightly different than TGIChiliRobin\'s."
Mary P.,San Francisco  CA,2,33,,7/19/2009,4.0,Came here on a Saturday night around 7pm and had to wait almost an hour to get seated...fortunately there's a Barnes & Noble right across the mall so we could just sit and read. Otherwise the wait would have been way too long. The service wasn't great  either - my dad ordered the soup and salad  the latter of which arrived along with the rest of our food and the former of which didn't come for another half hour or so. And the maitre 'd said that was a SLOW night for them! I can't imagine how bad the wait and service are on a busy night!Aside from those drawbacks  though  the food was quite good and the ambiance was fun. I had their root beer  which they brew themselves (YUM) and the parmesan chicken. The portions were huge  and it was so good that I forgot about the wait :)
Andrew L.,Millbrae  CA,15,29,3,10/10/2009,1.0,bj's undeniably has the best wings in the world. they get two stars for that. beer is pretty good as well and i'll give them another two stars. they get another star for the rest of the food  cuz its all pretty decent. but they get four negative stars for their wack customer service...it took me 15 minutes to get the attention of a waiter who was goofing around with a table full of his friends. when he finally came  i asked for extra napkins and he said he'll be right back. watched him walk away and rejoin the group and hung out with them for another 5-10 minutes. he then pulls a wad of napkins from his pants back pocket  walks over and puts the wad of napkins on our table and walks away. like  wtf guy? really?went to this place pretty regularly before that incident and they were always slow. could never get the attention of the waiter/waitress. bartenders have terrible customer service. haven't gone back there since. its a shame because the wings are bomb.
Andi T.,San Francisco  CA,412,1080,327,12/10/2006,3.0,The service was friendly  the beer (red) was decent  and the food was about what you'd expect from a place like this. I give them an extra star for showing a women's basketball game on one of the bazillion TV sets and for having a few vegetarian options on the menu. It's better mall food than the Olive Garden  but how hard is that?
Alex H.,San Francisco  CA,22,42,,7/22/2008,4.0,"I love BJ\'s !!!! whether it\'s the one in Tanforan or Bridgepoint  I\'m there. Avocado Rolls is a must for me.. and I also need my TOTONKA beer. Only one time they were out of Totonka... so my back up was the PM Porter... good as well. And then just end it with their specialty pizza. Always had a good time at BJ\'s.. never had problems with the staff  they are always ""mostly"" nice ( the food industry is a bitch... so I understand). There is always a waiting time on the weekends.. but it is always like that not matter where you go."
Donna H.,San Francisco  CA,575,437,131,5/10/2007,3.0,i go to bj's for the spinach artichoke dip  berry cider  and yummy pizookies.. the cider is way too carbonated.. ugh.. i burp all the time  but this was just ridiculous and uncomfortable.for some odd reason  there is always a wait.. every time i've gone there  it's been packed.. we had 22 tables ahead of us  but im guessing some folks gave up because we waited a little over half an hour and on got seated. last night was especially crazyyyy during the warriors/jazz game2.. i think that's the only time i want to go there now because it was amazing! the whole restaurant was roaring with simultaneous groans and cheers... if only the warriors had won... Sooo.. if you're here for a game  you're bound to be in the vicinity of a tv. the servers don't really bother you when you've got your eyes glued to the tv.. but will check up on you now and then. the bar area gets pretty packed  so get there early!not a huge fan of their chicago style pizzas and the rest of the food is typical american fare.. i like their potatoes  but i like all potatoes  so i can't rate bj's based on baked potatoes. not to mention you really can't screw them up.. service was fine. the food came quickly.. it was yummy.. donna was happy..
W W.,Millbrae  CA,18,44,2,11/13/2007,2.0,Pricey. The food isn't that great. Decent at best.The surrounding is nice though.
Posi P.,San Mateo  CA,7,30,3,2/18/2009,4.0,The best BJ's! I come all the way from San Mateo to THIS BJ's just so I don't have to go to the one at Bridgepoint.
G L.,Oakland  CA,1,32,1,4/10/2011,2.0,Never heard of this place before I went for a work event. I thought the name was a joke  especially considering Hooters is on the other side of the mall entrance. Sadly this place is for real. Extremely large menu of mediocrity. I am no chain snob and have happily enjoyed many a meal at Olive Garden  Chili's  Red Lobster  etc  but BJs is worse than them all. Also the service always seems rushed even when there isn't a crowd.
Michelle P.,Oakland  CA,7,41,,12/20/2008,3.0,i remember when this BJ's first opened.. everyone came here.why they always came here?because the pizookie is soooo good.other than that? i really don't know.i'll admit  the pizookie is really good. their artichoke dip is pretty awesome too. but the rest of the menu isn't that great. i don't know why everyone gets the pizza  i don't find any of their specialties very special at all (bad joke  i know). and yes  they have a very large selection of beers that are probably very good.. but i don't like beer. they do have one that i really like though  but thats probably because it doesn't taste like beer at all.with all the chain restaurants around  this place is definitely right up to par with the rest of them. nothing special. semi-decent food for the masses. but i will say  this is a really good place to come and watch the basketball game :]
J S.,South San Francisco  CA,2,22,,2/21/2008,1.0,At the end of my first visit I swore I'd never return. After my second visit (yeah I know  shut up) I decided to write this review. Virtually none of the four or so dishes I tasted would I describe as 'good.' Most I would describe as very bad  including the nachos. I thought nachos were a safe bet. B.J.'s proved me wrong.The staff ranges from indifferent to downright hateful. The name is very fitting  'cuz this place blows.
T H.,San Mateo  CA,2,32,,10/21/2005,2.0,"You\'re experience may be different than mine  and there will certainly be people that really like BJ\'s. \r However  after 2 visits  and a couple of hundred $$ later  count me out.\r Don\'t get me wrong. The design and ambiance is interesting and new for our area. The beers taste tested ok. The music type is welcome. I really wanted BJ\'s to work out - we need another trustable restaurant.\r The staff was fine; personable and caring. However  there are so many different people interacting with the table that you don\'t see your waitperson that often. ) We requested ketchup with two different people and it never came. Finally  we scrounged a bottle off a neighboring table.)\r But these recipes  and the kitchen  just don\'t cut it. Middle-of-the-road flavors. Nothing striking.\r Not one person that went with us in two visits ever said ""wow  that\'s good."" \r So I\'ll just list the various things that I thought  or others told me. (We did share bites off our orders.)\r - No sauce or flavoring on the various dishes were anything more than bland. (Sauces with onion strings are mild and unopinionated. Chili is surprisingly pedestrian. Tartar sauce is almost certainly generic wholesale.)\r - Potato wedges that came with a dish were cold - well the ones on the top were. The few on the bottom were lukewarm. But  the food they came with  (battered cod on the fish and chips plate) was hot.\r - However  the fish was over-cooked  and  get this  tough and stringy. The batter was chewy  rubbery. Very strange. Not crisp.\r - Fish tacos were simply average flavors.\r - The Chili Baked Potato was gargantuan. I swear - it\'s just not a natural size. The chili served over it looked like it had been painted on with a paintbrush - really. Then cheese melted on top of that. The potato didn\'t ""flake"" when you forked it - it came apart in a kind of pasty chunk. I don\'t understand how you bake a potato and make it do that. It was cooked and done well enough  but the meat of the potato was like molded paste. I was really confused by that.\r - Fiends we saw at a nearby table had a cheese pizza and the chicken baked potato on their table. Said the pizza was ok  liked the crust. The baked potato was being sent back as inedible (didn\'t like the texture of the potato either.)\r There\'s more  and there were some things I did like (Like the various brews they create. I tried 4  liked all but one - liked the strawberry lemonade and the Pizooki dessert.)"
Marjorie B.,San Francisco  CA,229,283,35,12/2/2006,3.0,We were almost expelled for being too rowdy. Mediocre service attributed to its popularity as a hang out dine and drink place after a full day of shopping. Great appetizers and generally pretty good signature microbrews. The amber ones are my favorite. If you elect to try and finish the beer sampler by yourself  plan on having a barf bag at hand.
Ry T.,San Francisco  CA,581,1494,1844,8/2/2008,3.0,"Not the most spectacular place for food  just another ""Elephant Bar"" chain. Visually ease-dropping on surrounding customers  the deep pan pizzas were popular as were the baked potato skins. The baked potatoes which came with entrees were huge. We tried the sliders (Angus mini-burgers) which weren\'t that good. The buns tasted bland. It came with sliced tomatoes  pickles and shredded lettuce. A side of their thin fries was an extra $1 only! They were crispy and good. The onion strings were extremely oily. Gasp  I could fuel a car with all that oil and save some money. The Caesar salad wasn\'t too bad  a bit heavy on the dressing  no anchovies (shucks). A large bowl of clam chowder was a tad larger than a cup of soup but it had a lot of minced clams in it  just too salty. What did taste pretty good was the pasta and chicken and hubby liked his grilled chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes (taters were good!) and surprisingly  all 3 chicken dishes we ordered were cooked just right. The chicken was nice and moist. Our server kept our glasses filled and was perfunctory. There is an extensive beer and cider list and they make their own brand of ale. Reservations are for 6 or larger but they\'ll write your name down and hold it until your name is called and if you don\'t answer  they\'ll give your table away. Still  I wouldn\'t make a special trip to come here to eat."
mario S.,CA  CA,12,30,,7/27/2008,3.0,"BJ\'s has good beer but it ends there. Food here has the ""I\'ve been frozen before"" taste. BUT.. this is a cool place to hang out have some beers and watch the game on the big screen HD tvs."
R G.,San Bruno  CA,7,40,,12/6/2008,3.0,This place is crazy busy on Friday/Sat. nights since it is the only place around beautiful San Bruno that isn't a fast food joint or one of the horrible Applebees/Chilis/TGI Fridays/Ruby Tuesday nightmares. BJ's has some really nice micro brews and a good menu selection. The fish and chips are the best I have had since visiting England last year and the halibut tacos are very nice. If there is a long wait  they have a large bar area where you can get full service. If you want to wait for a table  just get the buzzer and go hang out at the big book store across the hall. This place is a chain  but it doesn't give that feel of being at a Denny's in Green Bay  WI. like other places.
Jessica B.,Millbrae  CA,0,14,,6/1/2013,1.0,My party of three (myself  my husband and my 7 year old son) arrived at the restaurant around 5pm. It wasn't too packed as the wait was only 10 minutes. When we were seated we noticed many many open tables and booths yet they had a few people waiting up front. Once they sat us down they sat us in the back right in between two other tables. We moved to a booth and things seemed better until I opened the napkin to retrieve my silverware. All the utensils were spotted and my fork had residual red lipstick smeared on it and I opened all six napkins that were on the table. Then we ordered our dinners. I ordered the baked potato. 45 minutes after taking our order the waiter brings my son and my husband's food and asks me if the manager has spoken with me. No one had. Apparently they ran out of potatoes. I was offered soup or salad after the fact. I declined and still no one came to talk with me. I watched my family eat and our waiter was nowhere to be found. I guess he didn't want to deal with us anymore because of the dinner issue. We had to flag him down to get our check because we wanted to get the heck outta there. Needless to say it was a horrible experience. On my way out I informed the manager of the issues and she told me she would look into it although she didn't ask me for any information so I think it is highly unlikely that she did. There was no service recovery attempted and I'll be damned if I ever eat there again. So not impressed.
BigAppetite ..,Pacifica  CA,4,63,7,8/2/2007,1.0,I came to this location with my friend for dinner. I ordered a burger and a pizza. The burger was overseasoned...almost to the point of inediblness  and the pizza was below average. Everything was overpriced in my opinion. The only plus side was the service and even that was marginal.
Aaron G.,South San Francisco  CA,0,15,,7/8/2009,2.0,This place is way too crowded. I can't figure it out because the food isn't very good(I had a pizza and the dough was still raw). The waitress was rude to me and my guest and when I said something she went over to her fellow waitress friend and I swear she started talking shit. WHAT BITCH? I do like the bar though. The bartender is cool. He saved this from becoming my first one star review.
Derek Alistair J.,San Francisco  CA,89,146,,8/15/2007,2.0,here's a little story regarding this place.a couple walks in. and decide they're going to have lunch. its summer  its hot and all they want is to sit in a relaxing place thats quiet  quant and can afford some privacy while being able to afford the food.this couple decides all these things are available here. upon entering  they get seated. greeted by rather disproportionately shaped woman with dough eyes and smile.as the couple sits  they're greeted by a rather hulking gentleman.after going off on verbatim  he decides  to hit on the woman  'hey where do you go?' 'UCSD''oh thats cool. yeah I'm studying stuff too. I really like reading and stuff.''oh you don't say?''so what are you studying?''astrophycists''oh thats so awesome. yeah I want a major where I can make some money too. I was thinking of going to SDSU.''oh thats interesting ' Kristin replys  Steve coughs.'oh hey man  sorry  what's up with you man?''good  just a bit hungry.''So Bro  Where do you go to school?'obviously angered that he hasn't even asked for their order  steve turns and smiles and replies 'oh  I am studying at the School of Hard Knocks. Where I'm getting my PHD  my Playa Hatin' Degree.'Kristin  unable to turn away and then laugh  burst in laughter  he gets their order  returns with the cheque. thats a true story. I kid you not. so what's the moral of the story?never eat. here. ever. please.do you understand that friend?ugh.
Peter L.,Los Altos  CA,4,47,,10/12/2008,3.0,Food here is just ok  not too good  not too bad. If you've been to one BJ's you've been to them all  there is absolutely no need to come back here again and again. It's got some big screens and many smaller TVs so it should be decent if you come here to watch games. Their brews aren't bad  I'd say above average. My favorite is the Red. Our waiter at this particular was this no-so-bright emo kid. Couldn't recommend anything to us  couldn't tell what's good and what's bad.We went on Sat night at around 10  a group of 5  and there was no wait to sit around the bar area.
Leroid D.,San Francisco  CA,151,294,7,4/27/2006,3.0,"I give it extra stars for the convenience. It\'s a decent spot to hang out with the folks  watch sports  and knock back a few of their in-house ales (which are not so bad). Other than that  most of these ""comfort food"" chains are all the same. I can\'t think of one dish that stands out at BJ\'s. If Chili\'s  Red Robin\'s  or TGI Friday\'s too busy  you can go to BJ\'s. And vice versa. Got a large party of 10+  make sure to call 24 hours in advance."
Nathalie N.,Sacramento  CA,214,309,319,1/31/2007,2.0,The place lacks service. I dont know how many times Ive had to ask my server for water and got it after I was done with my dinner. My boyfriend asked for bread with his pasta. And he didn't get it till after he was half way thru. The idea of waiting for dessert for 35 minutes is beyond me.
Shannon H.,Reno  NV,19,19,,11/19/2008,5.0,This was the first time I had every been to BJ's and I had an awesome experience! My Fiancee and I wanted to set at a booth  but the hostess told us that there wasn't a server for where we wanted to sit  but then Cory directed us to the bar area where we cold sit at a booth   and get money off of our appetizer and drinks... Thanks Cory! Our waitress Lee was also very cool. She kept on top of our drinks and was very helpful in my drink selection. Thanks Lee!
Julie W.,Daly City  CA,14,63,4,11/17/2008,3.0,This place has great apps  though don't even bother on a weekend night or Fridays. There will ALWAYS be a 1.5-2 hour wait for dinner. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants or places where I need to wait more than an hour especially for franchise type food. It does deserve 3.5 stars really since service is friendly and food is decent  though quite greasy.
Lizzy L.,San Francisco  CA,215,167,17,11/15/2007,4.0,a pitcher of nutty brunettespinach artichoke dip& a white chocolate macademia nut pizookiei don't care about the wait  the price  or the damn pizza. give me these 3 glorious indulgences & i am set for life.
Alberto S.,South San Francisco  CA,3,62,10,3/16/2008,3.0,The food is okay. Not my first choice (or 10Th choice)  but we go here for office lunches. The place looks nice and it gets crowded at lunch time. I haven't been there at night. If you're in the mall and very hungry you may want to check-it out. They have a variety of choices: hamburgers  sandwiches  salads  pasta and pizza. I had the chili once and was expecting something thick...I got more of a soup. I recently had the sliders (small hamburgers). They are listed on the appetizer section. You get four small burgers with lettuce  tomato and pickles.  They weren't bad.
Mario P.,South San Francisco  CA,100,232,264,6/23/2008,4.0,The portions are plentiful and the food just tastes really good. One of the better additions to the remodeled Tanforan Mall. The wait can be a little long  especially when you have impatient kids  but worth it. The club sandwich is yummy and ranks pretty high on my list (I've had some pretty bad ones at other places). Their Cookie dessert is just too filling (eat light if you want to try it). Don't get me wrong - it's delicious and you better ask for some cold milk (you can't drink anything else with it)! Service varies depending on which server you get. I have to say  the females seem to always have better service  but their was at least one guy who deserved a good tip when I ate there earlier this year.
Heidi F.,Oakland  CA,17,103,,8/6/2008,3.0,The food taste good  big portion and decent prices. Minus two star because like most people said  service is sooooooooo slow.
adam m.,Newtownards  United Kingdom,7,77,1,9/9/2008,2.0,"This place seems to rely on quantity and not necessarily quality. The servers were quite attentive and the food was good  but good in a ""it wasn\'t bad"" kinda way."
Stephen P.,San Bruno  CA,92,99,14,7/9/2008,2.0,Boring!!!! My my  what can I say about boring. Lets see. Best thing on the menu is...none of it is horrid. Would I spend a dime over this place before going almost anywhere else. Frankly no. So why so down on old BJ? Well lets see. Beers are - just ok. Food is Fridays quality and variety. The crowds are - just that. The service is ok. I have gone at least 30 times for this or that reason and frankly - no improvement. But it never gets worse. So if you want to go where you can get a decent lettuce wrap or roast beef dip  go here. If you want decent food and good beer. Don't waist your time.
Randy G.,San Francisco  CA,12,1,,3/25/2011,4.0,I LOVE this place!!! GREAT food  friendly service and YAY half price happy hour
Arica V.,San Francisco  CA,248,256,1,7/4/2010,2.0,It's pretty bad when my bf encourages me to write a bad review on yelp. He believes that you should go a couple times to give a more complete review. BJ's is Shawn's favorite restaurant so we have been here way more than a couple times. We stopped frequenting this location because of a couple of things. We have on more than one occasion received a dead pager. While we sat for an awfully long time in front of the check in stand and kept inquiring of our status  no one ever thought to see if our pager was working or to ask our names. Then they acted like we had missed the pager going off with no apology. Another reason was that I order the same salad every time and every time it comes out wrong. All I ask is that I have a Santa Fe salad with NO red peppers and shrimp. Every time it has peppers in it and one time it came out with chicken - this last time the shrimp came out undercooked. Our waiter was really cool but obviously this place doesn't have it together. We will be venturing to Bridgepointe for our next BJ's fix - the food is much better and the service is actually good.
Vivian D.,San Francisco  CA,153,351,106,5/14/2008,5.0,Their food and service here is usually pretty good. Also  you can walk around the mall while you wait  which is a plus. =) I would come here just for one of their pizookis! they're amazing!
Gary L.,Oakland  CA,178,273,45,5/8/2008,4.0,I've only been to this BJ's for Happy Hour. There's a good HH selection of brews and bar food. I like the brunette ale which is what I usually go with (what can I say  I'm a sucker for brunettes). And now  HH starts even earlier at 3 instead of 4  so there's one extra hour to forget about the days work.
Davvy L.,Portland  OR,81,64,32,7/26/2006,4.0,Have a Taster Round... 8 glasses of 8 oz beer of each kind... Gotta love it...
Johnny T.,San Francisco  CA,21,98,7,6/23/2008,2.0,Whenever I come here  I always try to get the most healthiest thing on the menu  but it's hard when everything sounds so greasy  even the salads. I can tell you  never order the lettuce wraps here! It's so damn oily and greasy! There is so much excess oil at the bottom of the boil of the minced chicken. Ewwwww. The only reason why I come here is whenever i'm feeling hungry while shopping and don't wanna eat in the food court. Even though I know I should of just eaten at the food court  'cause im sure they have betters things there... for the future reference. Another reason why I come here is for the Kazookies! their DEELISH! Esp. the OREO one. Its a must def for whoever comes here! The wait for seats is really long espically on fridays/saturdays nights. So.. come early!
Alexandra A.,Daly City  CA,27,44,5,8/2/2008,4.0,Every time I eat here I am impressed by the food and the service. I guess that will happen when you sit at the bar a lot  even so when I would come here with friends the service was alway great. One thing I have noticed is that if you are seated at one of the table and don't order a beer the service tends to go downhill a little bit. Maybe it's me but that's just my take. Anyway back to the review. My first time at this place I ordered a fettucini alfredo - regular size. Boy was that filling or what! I came out of there pretty satisfied. Here's a comparison for you when you order the same dish at the Olive Garden it shouldn't be dry and hard but moist and creamy. BJ's version of that dish was just what was expected. And the Olive Garden serves Italian food by default - go figure! It's kind of sad when another restaurant makes something better than you when that's supposed to be what you are good at. Some restaurants have some appetizers that just get you through the time until you get your actual meall. At BJ's just eating an appetizer alone can really fill you up. Now don't get me started on the desserts. They really take care of you here. The BJ's Brownie is really divine. From far away it looks like a small mountain of ice cream  whipped cream  fudge sauce and then the brownie that's slightly warm. Yummy! Thanks BJ's for making a fan out of me. I really love ya!
Jeremy W.,San Francisco  CA,58,49,50,2/20/2007,5.0,5 stars based on two experiences; one in Long Beach  one in the Tanforan Mall. LB yielded the best deep dish pizza I ever had (two pizzas total) with appetizers and dessert coming out to be about 40$  which was a killer deal. Tanforan Mall  had lunch w/ coworkers. I ordered the soup and potato combo for lunch; luckily I only got HALF a potato b/c that shit was huge; think the size of half a shoebox. All that for only 8$; incredible deal. Great food  nice atmosphere  will defintely go here instead of TGI Friday's (see my review for it)
Y P.,San Bruno  CA,68,65,57,5/20/2007,3.0,For a restaurant chain it's a decent place. The service could really be a lot better. I've dined here at least 3 times and I hate always having to wait for a table. My first time  the waitress forgot one of our appetizers and we had to wait so long. She told us that she will not charge us for it. So much for trusting people.....I found out I was charged for it and I was already home and too tired to go back to dispute $8! It's a good place to meet because it's easy to find (especially when I have to meet with friends who are not familiar with San Bruno) but I'd rather have food in the food court than eat and be served in this place again. If you want a drink....just head to the bar.
Alvin C.,San Francisco  CA,0,16,,9/26/2009,2.0,"I\'d give them more stars (maybe if I bounce back from the next experience)  but the last time I went there they told us the wait would be like 45 minutes. Which is fine because I know they get busy but we waited about an hour and when we finally got inside  the restaurant was EMTPY. That is the most ridiculous thing I\'ve ever seen  it\'s a terrible way to do business. I understand if you\'re understaffed for the lunch hour but obviously you get customers at that hour then they should be smart enough to hire more staff for those hours. And when we finally got in the service was like ""eh...okay"". We waited a long time to order and then longer to get drinks then longer for food. It\'s not even like dinner time  it was like the hour before dinner where only a third of the restaurant was full. Please please please work on your customer service."
Alison N.,San Francisco  CA,230,242,15,12/13/2007,4.0,Fun place to go to with friends. I've eaten here twice  got the exact same thing. Chicken Caesar Salad with a root beer and a cookie dessert thing? They make their own root beer. Mmmmm. And the cookie thing....I really don't remember the name p-something? I dunno  it's good though w/e it's called. A WARM cookie with a load of ice cream. Delicious! As for the other stuff  I honestly could not tell you if it's good or not.
Mai G.,South San Francisco  CA,5,84,3,7/11/2008,2.0,came here for lunch...waited...waited...server arrived  took orders  food ok...came here for happy hour...waited...waited...waited...oh a table...waited...waited...server arrived...took order...waited...waited...waited...blonde's good...ask for lemon...waited...waited...waited...f%@k! where is that b*&^%ch!!!gave 3 pieces of lemons for a party of 8...come on!!!...asked for extra chair...rolled eyes on us...slow service with an attitude...ok food...ehng crowd
Angelica D.,San Francisco  CA,19,43,15,7/10/2010,3.0,The food is good. Sometimes cold tho. In a word inconsistent!!! The wait is ridiculous and sometimes NOT worth the wait. The hosts are always rude and act like they don't give a crap. They aren't friendly AT ALL! I've had many horrible experiences here and only come back when I have no choice. Pizookies are amazing tho! Deep dish and margherita flatbread pizza are good tho. Pastas very dry never enough sauce.
Jason F.,Denver  CO,55,297,72,3/5/2008,3.0,"I\'d give it 3.5 stars. I loved ""A drink like that""! It tasted soooo good  had two and probably could have had more! The dish I ordered was pasta and chicken which was very good. For dessert I shared a pazookie which was fantastic. So fattening  but ohhh so good. There server was friendly and nice and the service in general was just fine. I enjoyed my experience here. I have been to other Bj\'s restaurants and its a good place for some food. I loved that they had a billion tv screens playing every kind of sports you can think of  that\'s a big plus!"
Jay G.,South San Francisco  CA,81,39,10,5/21/2010,2.0,I've been here for happy hour  lunch  and dinner and can always say that i've never had good service. Decent service  but never good and most of the time even bad. I would recommend sitting at the actual bar  not the bar area. The servers there just seem like they don't care. Of course when they bring you your bill they are super nice and ask how everything was and if we need anything else. The food is pretty good and it's very close to my house which is why I've been there a handful of times. I would just hope that management does a better job of managing it's staff. There's usually a long wait and sometimes people end up leaving  and this could definitely be helped a lot if the staff was more efficient. I hate having to ask for the bill. The last time i went we sat there with empty plates and empty glasses while people were waiting to take our table in the bar area for at least 15 min. It was very evident we were done and ready to go but yet our server  busser  nobody seemed to care. Other servers went by but always look like they don't care about us  which i can understand since we aren't their table but they can at least smile or tell us they'll get our server for us. I would recommend trying somewhere else if possible.
Mark D.,Washington  DC,32,792,25,7/13/2007,3.0,A chain amongst other chains...BJ's doesn't really distinguish itself too much. The spinach dip appetizer was good  they specialize in pizza and it was only okay...a little dry and not saucy enough. The beers were good but pricey.
Alia D.,Los Angeles  CA,441,470,171,9/13/2007,2.0,Everything is really not that great. The only food worth noting is the cookie that comes in the pizza pan. Appetizers . . . eh. Main course . . . eh. Beer isn't all that special either. It is a large chain restaurant so expect the service and food quality of a chain. I usually get lured into comin back because of friends. Half the time we are ignored by the host and end up at the bar area seating. S'ok.
Patrick G.,Brooklyn  NY,47,247,8,9/14/2006,3.0,The beers are definitely worth your while after shopping at Tanforan  and the chicago-style pizza's aren't half bad. Burgers and sandwiches are standard fare for a place like this and you can't go wrong with those  either. Big  hearty portions. My only complaint is that the other customers seem to get kind of bitchy here. I guess that's what happens when you wait an hour for someplace when having few quality alternatives  similar to the Elephant Bar phenomenon at Serramonte. One time a person came up to my table  reached right in front of me to take a menu from the center caddy  but had trouble getting it out  so fumbled awkwardly for ten seconds  all the time her arm inches in front of my face  never once even acknowledging me. At that point she might as well have helped herself to a few french fries off my plate.
Mel L.,San Francisco  CA,106,161,,9/6/2007,2.0,yawn. food is nothing to rave about. it may be okay the first couple of times  but really after the 2nd visit you won't want to be back. the wait is horrible and bar is too damn crowded. service is lacking - i swear on my last visit the waiter was high. i shouldn't have to ask 3 times for a damn box or wait 15 minutes for you to get me a check. if you  like i did  have to go for work dinners or something else you can't get out of - just drink lots and lots of cider. that's the only thing on the menu that is good time after time. plus  they can't screw up cider  can they?
Dao C.,San Francisco  CA,164,55,8,9/10/2007,3.0,"I personally don\'t like the food at BJ\'s. The food is ""ok"". Actually  it\'s all ""beer food"". I wouldn\'t come here to find a wholesome meal. The only thing I like about about this place is their variety of beer. It\'s a nice place to hang out and have a party at."
Marciano P.,San Francisco  CA,100,47,,3/18/2006,5.0,Man  this place is the bomb. They make their own beer  and it's cheap  2.95 a pint. The food is good. The price is not bad  just think of TGIF's prices  but much better selection on food  drinks and dessert. The Pizookie is frickin awesome!!!! I will contuinue to come to this resturant. I first went to this place in Colorado in Boulder. I loved it then and love it now. The wait could be long for seating  this place is always packed  but it is worth the wait.
Mikey L.,Daly City  CA,0,5,,1/13/2009,4.0,This place was okay. I went on a weekend night and it was a little crowded but that comes with the territory in the bay.I had a chicken breast dish and it actually was pretty good for what I would expect at a restaurant like this. It was some time ago that I went so I believe it came with vegetables and mashed potatoes and again  these were better than expected. My companion has the pot roast dish and I tried some of that and it actually was decent as well.The sights were okay  I mean it is South San Francisco so you will see your fair share of trashy mexicans  stupid looking asians who are spending their parents money and goofy whites watching whatever sports are on so no surprise there. There were no attractive females of note dining on that night  again  not a surprise. The male waiters were dorks and the girls at the front who assign the buzzers had so much makeup on that I couldn't tell how they looked. The female waitresses were pretty much blah  yes  that's how I would describe them. My waitress however was the best of the bunch so i lucked out. So was cute in that sort of could afford to lose 10 pounds  start of a double chin filipina way. Anyway  if you know most flip females then you know I mean that lovingly right....
Chris F.,Littleton  CO,22,260,,1/29/2008,3.0,I've eaten at my fair share of BJ's in Cupertino and down in SoCal  so I wasn't surprised at how my experience at this one turned out. It's a typical burger joint  bar  sports bar  and pizza place. The food is good and the portions are huge. The service was okay  nothing extraordinary or noteworthy. Nothing much more to rave about  since it pretty much compares to other restaurants that serve American food.
Cassie L.,Arcata  CA,7,65,,6/24/2006,1.0,"This place is another TGIF  it sucks! Plan on waiting at least 45 minutes up to an hour  for food that will take 40 minutes to arrive once you order it! I would expect this from a restaurant that wasn\'t a chain  but this restaurant sucks! Seriously there is not one ounce of originality within the walls of the ""brewery"" (their beer sucks too!)"
Michelle N.,San Mateo  CA,261,103,106,3/31/2007,2.0,EVERY TIME I COME HERE... I keep forgetting not to because the food is just  uggh. At first  when i tried it  it was delish. But you later on realize  its... JUST LIKE TGIF  and all those other chain food restaruants.  We came in between lunch and dinner  for some linner. Even though I have been here multiple times  this time had to be one of the saddest times ever. I swear  the employees had no enthusiasm. When I used to work at a restaraunt  I had to be peppy and everything. The hostess was like *eh* when she looked at us  and told her we have a table for two. She slowly got us menus  dropped a bunch  picked it up... then brought us to the table... slowly. Waiters around us were eh. Our waiter was dull. Well  maybe he was nice  but he was barely around so I couldn't even refill my drink. boooo to that. Ok so BJs sucks  pizookie? are good. Food is eh.
Michael R.,San Bruno  CA,1,26,1,3/29/2007,2.0,Great Beer & Mediocre Food. The main problem is the inconsistancy of the food & service  I have best results at the bar  but when eating with my family its always hit or miss. THe last time I was there with my Toddler I requested a high chair and kept receivng a booster  which is too big for her at 11/2 yrd old.Go for happy hour and the sports  forget the food unless you're to buzzed to drive.Great Sports Bar look with excellent TV coverage.
Veggie J.,Daly City  CA,4,151,15,4/9/2008,4.0,"the first time i went to BJ\'s was in cupertino. my cousin said they had ""potatoes on steroids"" (i\'m picturing potatoes as big as my head) and the BEST root beer ever. i soon found out that the potatoes weren\'t so ginormous  and the root beer tasted pretty much like any other root beer i\'ve had. well  that\'s what i get for having great expectations.anyhow  i still like to come to this BJ\'s for the typical american food. it really helps when you\'re with people who all have different tastes. so pasta  pizza  potatoes  meat...i\'m sure everyone will find something.for appetizers  i\'ve tried the avocado egg rolls and wedge-cut french fries  both of which are good. i mean  come ON! avocados and french fries! two of the best things on earth. but the REAL DEAL is the cilantro pesto appetizer pizza. normally  i absolutely detest cilantro  and eating it will result in some throw up-age. but for some reason  i am able to eat this pizza! it\'s topped with yummy tomato bruschetta stuff and this is the reason this place gets four stars. the next time i go back  i think i\'ll just order one whole thing for myself. AWESOME.their salads sound pretty good  although i\'ve never tried it. i\'m not really big on getting a salad as a meal  but i would definitely try one of them out someday.the pasta and potatoes aren\'t too bad. they pass. there\'s quite a few vegetarian options  so it\'s good to not have only one thing off the menu to choose from.it\'s almost always a must to get a pizookie after a big artery-clogging meal. seriously  there\'s never any room to force a frickin\' cookie with ice cream down your throat  but somehow  we manage. it\'s a big cookie. how can you resist?so all in all  typical restaurant with typical food. nothing super spectacular. every time i\'ve been here  the people working have been super nice and friendly. maybe i\'m lucky  i don\'t know. one annoyance about this place  though  is the noise level. i can never hear what the person sitting next to me is saying. and even then  we have to scream to each other. and then it results to eating silently as though we were mad at each other or like we haven\'t eaten for days."
Matt J.,Omaha  NE,9,164,13,2/20/2008,4.0,Typical brewery/restaurant. Decent beer and pretty good food. The pizza was great and the wait time doesn't seem so long since you can wander in the mall while you wait. Although I can't recall what we had for an appetizer (some sort of shrimp roll or something) it was really good as well.
Mikey D.,San Francisco  CA,199,175,146,5/28/2009,4.0,i gave four stars only because they have the best root beer. you can't get good beer anywhere than of course bj. they make their own root beer  how cool is that. okay for the food.. bj's pizza are the best  if you like thick crust. the spare ribs are good too  but again... what resturant can't make good ribs. if you do go to bj's remember pizza and beer. that's all you need for a good dinner. anything else i heard wasn't that good. i had the spaghetti something. let's say i had only a few bite before i gave it to my dog. sorry Brownie! he seems to like it. but again  dogs like anything than salad. okay enough said. remember Bj's pizza  beer and really big tv's screen to watch sports. if you like the atmosphere  go there.
Retired B.,Los Angeles  CA,571,1889,1488,12/14/2009,2.0,It takes super long to get a table here! I do like the pizookie so I can't complain too much. I think the service at the San Mateo is a little bit better because they aren't as crowded.
Kymberli C.,Clayton  CA,136,1486,5781,12/18/2007,3.0,"I was dissappointed when I went to the BJ\'s in Maui because they didn\'t have the stuffed potatoes there but they had them here!! But i was dissappointed at the potato here because they cut it in half and just topped it... it wasn\'t a stuffed baked potato... I remember the location in LA had a whole stuffed potato  not just one sliced in half. This location is really nice and a good place to watch a game because theres a million and one tv\'s in here. They also had a really good cocktail with don julio called ""El Diablo"". And you can\'t forget to get a pizzookie!! yum!"
Khan M.,San Jose  CA,15,17,,1/28/2006,3.0,Man this place is loud never really noticed before but its hard trying to have a conversation with someone here. Lots of TV with sports which is always nice. Food is your typical brewery slash diner place. All the fattening food you can get your hands on.
Deb B.,South San Francisco  CA,6,113,19,12/16/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,We revisited BJ's last night and found it to be improved from our last few visits. The food was much better  and the beer was as good as ever. I would've given it four stars except for two important issues: 1) We were told we would be seated 30-40 mins upon check in. That was fine since we love their beer. 45 mins later we checked with the hostess and she said we had three people ahead of us. We were not seated for another 15 mins...so they were off by 30-20 mins and that's a bit much. 2) While waiting for our table we drank outside on a fairly cool evening. We asked twice to have the gas lanterns turned on for heat  and were told twice someone would be sent out. No one ever came until a bus boy cleaned up and we asked him to turn on the heaters. After starting to get warm our table was ready! My husband had a burger with avocado  bacon & pepper jack cheese. He liked it very much but commented the burger was skimpy on avocado. I had the scampi pasta with so much shrimp i was amazed! i only ate 1/3 of it and took 2/3 home. the garlic cheese bread was fantastic. we will come back again since this was a better experience.
Heather I.,Spokane  WA,0,39,,8/29/2008,2.0,The only reason this place gets more than one star is the pizookie  that item alone saves this place. Otherwise  the service is horrendous! We went here for a friend's birthday  called in advance since there was a big group of us  and still had to wait an hour over the hour-long wait they quoted us. WE had about 3-4 different server exchanges during the dinner and nobody seemed to communicate with each other. Our dinner orders turned out fine  but dessert was another mess (took forever and then they brought out the wrong thing). But  man  that pizookie  esp the peanut butter one  is to die for....
Barack Y.,Herald  CA,134,20,,8/24/2010,2.0,Drink's are watered down. Service is lackluster. Drug's being sold in parking lot. ghetto hood area
Angela Y.,Fremont  CA,36,253,22,12/22/2007,4.0,The deep dish pizzas are delicious and loaded with toppings. The drink menu is creative and long. I hate the long line at the restaurant. I would come here again if I have a reservation. However  the happy hour here is awesome and full of good times.
Tracy C.,San Francisco  CA,6,11,,6/29/2009,1.0,I came here for my Birthday with my parents. We got a table pretty quick and after the waitress took our order  she disappeared. Oh wait  she came back with our drinks  THEN disappeared. In 45 minutes  no one had come to check on us or let us know the status of our meal. Didn't even refill the drinks. They weren't even that busy! I was tempted to just walk out. THIS SUCKED. So we finally get our food and our lovely waitress never said anything to any of the three waiters about my birthday. WHERE'S MY FREAKIN BIRTHDAY PAZOOKI?!? My mom tells one of the waiters again and they bring one out. The waiter didn't seem to enjoy working there. I think he smiled once. The pazooki was good  but not worth the wait and lack of service. Never coming back to this BJs.
Nat K.,San Francisco  CA,105,381,3,1/31/2006,4.0,I adored this chain when I was in college and it was somewhat less of a chain. Yeah  the food can just be all right  but honestly  it's chain food  and I only go to chain restaurants when I crave chain food.  The beer is good  the pizza fulfills my specific craving  and the pizookie -- hot freshly-baked cookie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream -- is the stuff dreams are made of.
Jason A.,San Bruno  CA,830,585,342,4/19/2006,3.0,I really hate chain restaurants! The food here really isn't good at all. The deep dish pizza has chewy dough and lousy sausage and the rest is your typical wings  etc. I did like the vast amounts of flat screens all around  one of those lighter beers they serve  and the one food item: avocado egg roll dish! Being in San Bruno  we just don't have that many options for food and beer.
Mei N.,San Diego  CA,126,251,39,7/1/2007,3.0,um don't you have to be of age to serve alcohol??? none of the staff there looked a day over 18. we got seated fairly quick. i think we only waited about 20 minutes on a Thursday night. service was  eh. our kid of a waitress was a little weird. she never checked up on us and we had to flag down other staff members for lemon wedges or to add something to our order. oh yeah  at one point we had so many dishes on our table  we had to stack them ourselves. luckily  there was only 2 of us.as for the food. it wasn't too bad. as a main course we got a cesar salad (kinda expensive for the size) and a pizza (the bbq chicken). the cesar salad was a little salty. and we weren't offered extra grated Parmesan or anything.everything was mediocre with the wait staff being a little less than mediocre. yeah  this is kinda a blah review but this was what this place was. kinda blah.
Tastebud S.,Union City  CA,0,48,,3/18/2012,1.0,Each and everytime I come here  whether a Tuesday afternoon  it seems to always be busy. This business does not allow any reservation unless it's for a party of 9. Well here is how I rate this business. It's based on location/parking  service  price  quality/taste of the food  cleanliness. Alright here it is. Location/parking of course it's in the Tanforan Shopping Mall so parking is difficult. I usually end up finding parking farther from the entrance and more closer to the El Camino Real street. Service is like horrible. Waiter/waitress would try to be nice and friendly but getting them to come to your table once you have been seated takes another 10-15 minutes. So I would end up just placing all my orders and not try to order the drinks like they would normally do once they approach your table. And then the other thing was that it takes them 30 minutes to make Mac-N-Cheese for a child. Now give me a break  it looks like the pre-packaged microwavable Mac-N-Cheese. So why it took so long I could not tell you but I had to get the manager involve. He too could not give me an answer as to why it took so long to get it ready  when I specifically as for it to brought to our table as soon as it was done because I had a child who was hungry. I did also mention that to them. But of course that didn't matter to there establishment. So if you have a child who is diabetic  don't even try taking him/her here or otherwise they would end up in the hospital. Price for what in on there menu is not at all worth the money. I mean  come on  Mac-N-Cheeses is that even worth $6 or more? It came slightly over microwaved because it was almost dried out of the cheese. Quality/taste of the food  well as I mentioned already  it's not cracked up to be with what others have rated this business. Cleanliness it one thing that is good which is why I give them this 1 star rating. Sorry  for the being honest but I hate to read reviews and then finding out the opposite. Now other yelpers have given good ratings for a Pizookie. Now it's not that great. It's just a chocolate chip cookie with an ice-cream on top. There is nothing special about that. The twice that we have ordered this so-called pizookie  it was hard (over-cooked) cookie. I could hardly cut it with a spoon or fork to give some to my son. I can go on with food we have ordered that did not cut-it or even worth the time it took or the price for it. So let's just say this is not something to brag about to someone because you might be looked upon that person as not having good taste for the right type of restaurant.
Eazflo Z.,Solano County  CA,21,245,,1/23/2008,5.0,Yummy Yummy. I love BJs pizza. It is warm and thick it reminds me of the BEST version of round table if it was doing Chicago Style. Coming from Berkeley  people seem to push really crap pizza and call it good. NOT so at BJs it hits my pizza button right on! Plus  add the chopped salad and you can make a meal for 2 with a small pizza and be full.
Cecile R.,South San Francisco  CA,24,67,39,10/11/2005,3.0,"The first brewery in the San Bruno-South San Francisco area! Many screens. Many options on the menu from appetizers  salads  sandwiches  burgers  desserts and of course  their deep dish pizzas. The place just opened up and it is ""crowded"". I would place your name for a table but hang out in the bar and grab a table there. I must say  for a pretty new place  the service is keeping up. The staff is courteous. I don\'t have to travel to Elephant Bar in Milbrae anymore and I\'m sure this takes the load off of nearby Chili\'s."
Victoria R.,San Jose  CA,98,302,7,5/24/2006,3.0,I had a good experience. My girlfriend and I ate in the bar area. We both enjoyed what we ordered. For appetizers we ordered the Avocado Eggrolls (if you love avocado in any form  this is delicious). I ordered the Santa Fe Salad...yummy more avocadoes. this one is similar to the salad from Elephant Bar (Santa Fe Chicken Salad). It is a good filling salad!! My friend had the meat loaf sandwhich. She enjoyed hers as well  but saved it to make room for the dessert. We had something Oreo. It was ok.  I would go back and try other things. They a large appealing menu. I couldn't decide what to order at first. So many choices.
Rebecca J.,Nashville  TN,33,100,21,1/3/2008,4.0,I really do love this place. Mainly because it reminds me a bit of the city in Texas I used to live in. Great atmosphere and known for their beer samplers  pizza  and lively bar with big screen TVs. I go for the blackened chicken baked potato.
Izzy L.,Paris  France,262,9,7,10/9/2008,1.0,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. Justin  the manager of that place should be fired. We had a Corporate event for Bank of America and they told us that we would have to wait 2 hours on a WEDNESDAY NIGHT for 15 people around 700 pm. They wouldn't let us call it in. Then while we waited we could see empty tables but they told us that they were waiting for one table to leave. it was plain bull. After an hour and a half we asked if it there was a table available and they said  it has not been two hours yet. After two hours we asked and they said that a server had closed the back area so we couldn't sit there. WHAT???? So my manager went to the BJs manager and told him the situation and how we had been waiting for over 2 hours for nothing. His comment was  We quoted you two hours and it's been two hours with hella attitude. My manager got angry and said we were leaving. She was so disappointed because we all wanted to eat there and it was a complete waste of time. It was a going away party for 2 people and it was so embarrassing for her. We had spent so much money buying drinks and a couple of appetizers while we were standing around at the bar and waiting for two hours. What idiots!!! Did they not want our business??? After my manager told us what he said  he came over and said that they didn't have enough servers. We said that they could have at least had us sit down  because we didn't care if we waited. But he said  again  we quoted you two hours. We were like  WE KNOW but stop concentrating on what you said  the point is that you kept us waiting for nothing. Why would BJs keep a manager like that??? That is the fastest way to go out of business. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. The waitresses are nice but they should get out of that place and go somewhere else. The hostesses were idiots. I could have done a much better job organizing it so people could sit down. If they dont' have staff then they shouldn't have a big restaurant. We will never bring them business or recommend them. Seriously  big and small parties  beware this location and this manager. Did I say how freaking horrible they were? HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only reason I'm giving them a one because one of the waitresses was really nice and tried to help us. she is the ONLY reason.
David M.,San Francisco  CA,73,159,1,9/24/2007,4.0,Everything is great except for their pizza in my opinion. There are many interesting styles available in regards of pizza  but not many are great combos. I rather order their other dishes  such as pot roast  salads  and sandwiches. Have fun with acouple of people sampling their own brews because some are quite good and flavorful. Try them out and while you wait for your seating go to barnes and noble next door.
Mooky G.,San Francisco  CA,0,11,,7/25/2010,1.0,I'm giving this place one star because the food isn't that bad  but i had such a negative experience with a server that i don't think i'll ever go back again. She was probably the rudest server i've ever encountered in my life. She reminded me a lot of Vagita...
Sonya T.,San Francisco  CA,112,232,34,10/29/2005,4.0,Despite the kinky name  this is a great place to eat. I've been to 3 of them in the Bay Area and like them all. They brew their own beer -- I tried one and it tasted good. They are known for their Pizookie dessert  which is a gigantic cookie with ice cream on top.
D J.,San Francisco  CA,13,245,3,3/25/2007,4.0,"This place is good for what it is. I usually am here later in the evening and reap the benefits of happy hour. I think it starts after 10pm. Dollar off beers and half price pizza. The pizza isn\'t that bad. They do have some good combinations for toppings. The service was prompt and friendly the few times I have been there. Good for a ""chain restaurant"" and I would be there everynight if it was closer to my house."
May A.,CA  CA,59,188,,5/16/2007,3.0,We actually like the food here and the beer is awesome the onion appetizer is to die for but what we can't stand is the service. We've been here enough times from the opening to current and still we can hit or miss with the service.
Jen P.,South San Francisco  CA,65,279,3,7/18/2007,3.0,mmmm....p'zookie. i would come here just for that giant chocolate chip cookie served all warm & gooey with a scoop of ice cream. just don't expect me to share!this place is okay. i agree  a step up above tgif's but not that much higher. your typical microbrewerie/pizza joint i guess. yummy apps to start your meal like minced chicken/lettuce cup and spinach dip/chips. personal size pizzas are also good  especially for the kiddies. i like the selection of beers (i think it's the blondie that i usually order  i can't remember)  i keep meaning to come check out the happy hour specials but never make it!
Jen Y.,Oakland  CA,146,475,54,9/17/2007,3.0,This place reminds me of Elephant Bar mixed with a sports bar. The food is not bad  not bad at all. The seats and booths are comfy. I like that I could watch Giants games on the huge tv screen while eating my meal. Completely satisfying. Great for a casual weekend lunch with the fam.
Andrew P.,San Bruno  CA,0,34,,7/21/2008,4.0,The bar is always busy  no matter what day Ive gone its been slammed at the bar.Nice tv'salright foodthere own beer selection  i liked the red and the stout.dont get angel hair pasta  horrible.pizza's are good though
Spencer G.,San Francisco  CA,2,7,,5/13/2008,2.0,I would stay clear if I were you. When I go to eat I want to sit down order drinks  order food and then be served. The problem with this is at BJ's that isn't how it happens. It took over 20 minutes for us to get drinks  and another 50 to get our food. The food was good the deep dish pizza was delicious and everything was good but not worth the wait. When the waiter finally got around to asking us if we needed anything else I asked for a refill on my Root Beer (which they make there  very good). Took over 20 minutes and he brought it to us with the cheque. The total for the 6 of us was around $130. If you like to talk and socialize then this is the place for you if not bring a magazine.
Matt S.,Los Angeles  CA,3,84,2,2/19/2010,4.0,Cant go wrong with this place... Yeah its a chain but SO WHAT... The only thing bad about this one is the wait...
Cary W.,San Jose  CA,29,196,26,7/22/2006,3.0,Another company with SoCal roots  this location is popular during weekday lunches  and that's about the only time I'll go here. Not saying that the food or service is bad  but in the SF Bay Area  there are so many restaurants (including the taco trucks) to choose from  that why would you want to go to a cookie cutter chain?The food is dependable so if I'm taking a client out to a quick lunch in the South SF to Burlingame area  Elephant Bar or BJ's is the safe  quick choice.I do like their Pazookies. So really 3.5 stars then.
Jason C. J.,San Francisco  CA,1445,981,600,5/2/2007,4.0,The service isn't bad. Their drinks are good especially the ciders since their sweet and give off that buzz if you are getting away from a hard day's work. The food is pretty filling. If you love pizza  order the Great White. You'll love it!
Stevezee C.,Millbrae  CA,7,238,,7/22/2007,4.0,I'm usually not a fan of chain but this is not bad. The avocado egg rolls are crispy  soft in the middle and comes with sweet and sour sauce. Its a little pricey but not bad. The pizza is good enough but I'm not usually a fan of deep dish so I usually get one of the sandwiches. I had p'zookie and it just too big but very good.
R A.,Daly City  CA,7,18,1,10/27/2007,4.0,I enjoy coming here for their pizza. But let it be known that their host staff are such air headed tards!One busy evening  my wife and I step up to the front counter and the hostess is talking to what I can only guess is her imaginary friend. Another gentlemen at the front counter (looks like one of the shift managers)  grabs the hostess shoulder  and turns her around to face us....you know  the customers. My wife and I ask how long the wait is for two people; hostess says it will be around 50 to 55 minutes. I confirm with my wife  and we agree to wait it out - so the hostess takes my name. But then she tells me to come back in twenty minutes to get a pager  to which I acknowledge. Not more than 5 minutes later  my wife decides to ask for a pager  and voila! Pager available. So we're waiting in their establishment  because I never trust the true radius of those restaurant pagers  and lo and behold  two more hostesses appear and join the first one at the front counter. I swear it looked like a Jan Brady convention up front; only with the ditziness of younger sister Cindy. The shoot the breeze amongst themselves  as I watch customers walk in  stand for a good five to ten seconds before one of the Jans greets them. Either I was that bored to be easily amused  or they were so ridiculously moronic that I couldn't resist watching the live version of Dumb  Dumber  and Dumbest.OK  enough of the tards.....Our server was awesome! She was prompt  courteous  and sounded pleasant to talk with. Very professional indeed. Although we usually come for the pizza  we decided to go with the steak and potato dish. Good eating! The steak was prepared the way we like it (rare for me  medium for her)  and the potato was more than filling! I suppose any Clam Chowder expert would say that the Chowdah isn't that great  but to my chowder loving taste buds  they were good enough to enjoy like any other.The establishment is similar to anything else like it (brewery)  and that's just fine with me; it's what's expected.
larry s.,San Francisco  CA,6,117,25,10/21/2007,3.0,well i have tried this place several times & come to the same conclusion. the food here is decent but the service here is pretty mediocre. the buffalo wings are pretty tasty  the mozzarella sticks are not good at all. the burgers are pretty decent & made to order. i agree with the other reviewers  pass on the pasta.all in all  its another option for a place to grab a bite to eat & hang out. the food here is okay  pretty average nothing super special. the restaurant can get quite busy so be prepared to wait  we came here for lunch with 5 people & did not have a long wait. another time with came with a group of 10 people after a lion dance performance & we waited for about 45 minutes plus we could not get seated together. however  they did give us these pager things to carry about  so we were able to walk about to kill time.
vernice l.,San Francisco  CA,6,152,,10/20/2006,2.0,We decided to check this place out since we were out in the suburbs with two little kids. One of the little girls wanted clam chowder in a bread bowl so this was the closest place. We waited for about 35-45 minutes even though it was Thursday night. I was not expecting much  but my dinner entree was not even hot. I ordered the ribs and it was still cold. It took a long time for them to reheat it. I had a little bit of the Cajun Pasta. It tasted like something that could have been made at home. My husband said his chicken fried steak was too dry. I took a little bite of my friend's Chinese chicken salad and that tasted pretty good. If you have to go to a chain out here  I would vote for Mimi's Cafe!!
samer j.,Millbrae  CA,0,11,4,2/4/2010,2.0,this place is always over packed and service sucks...when they 1st open they had great prices and now not as good...the good is that they are open late and have good beer
Kim A.,Palo Alto  CA,0,12,,12/20/2008,1.0,We waited more than 35 minutes for our food. Our waiter didn't care nor did the entrance staff even after we brought their lack of service to their attention. We left. Horrible  horrible service. We intend to never visit any of these restaurants again.
bruce h.,San Francisco  CA,0,6,,3/15/2010,4.0,I really like this place. Great atmosphere  nice and mellow  dark but not so much that you're tripping over people's feet. The food is great. If you haven't tried the honey mustard salad  then you honestly haven't lived. It's absolutely heavenly. The waiters are usually pretty nice  too. The only complaint is that the seating takes quite a while and it is a tad expensive  but otherwise  this place rocks.
Rico d.,San Francisco  CA,41,9,,9/13/2007,3.0,I agree with some of you folks out there. It's typical bar food  but the Pazookie (chocolate chip pizza a la mode) is awesome!!!!!! Fresh bake with either milk chocolate chip or white chocolate. Hmm  Hmm  good!
Lady K.,San Francisco  CA,39,143,17,9/13/2007,3.0,s'okay. i dont know if its worth the wait  but HAPPY FACE FRIES PLS!
M.E. W.,Lynnwood  WA,24,44,27,8/16/2008,2.0,"I had some pretty good food here  the waitress was nice  but we had a really crappy experience with the hostess. We showed up and nobody was waiting for a table but us. We asked how long the wait was and tney said 10-20 minutes. We said ok  and wandered over to the bar area to see if there was anywhere to sit there. There wasn\'t  so we came back and sat down on a bench in front of the host area. We sat there and waited for about 15 minutes and noticed a lot of people coming in and being seated. Then we noticed that they all had pagers. One of our party went up and asked the hostess how much longer it would be. Apparently we weren\'t even on the list because ""we walked away"". We had been sitting there in full view of the hostess the whole time. The bench we were on is no more than five feet away from the desk and there was nobody else sitting there or standing in that area but us. She gave us a pager and made us wait 10 more minutes  and she kept giving us dirty looks the whole time. I don\'t think I\'ll be going back."
Jeremy B.,San Francisco  CA,349,45,99,2/10/2009,4.0,bjs is pretty crackin. the prices are like and other chain. some of the beer are coo even though i dont really like beer. dereks meatloaf sandwich is the bomb and the cookies and cream pazookie is hella good too  but usually im too full to get one. oh and if ur gonna get a mixed drink try the poison caramel apple (HELLA GOOD)
amanda p.,San Francisco  CA,0,11,,12/14/2011,5.0,love the soup plain and simple  and the parm crusted chicken is the business
Scott R.,San Mateo  CA,0,32,,9/4/2007,1.0,The food is just barely passable  which entitles this chain that does not know how a one star rating from me. Unfortunately (for me)  three out of four times I have gone to BJs there has been a serious problem with service. Either kitchen sends out someone else's food  ours never arrives or the server goes awol on a break or a shift change. I was compelled to write this review after my four and last time (I swear) visit to this lousy chain restaurant. If you are going to do big box chain with the kids  do Cheese Factory as they most often times get it right. Plus their food is far superior.
kimberly m.,San Francisco  CA,0,12,,11/13/2009,5.0,This is my FAVORITE place to go to watch a sporting game. The only bad thing is it is ALWAYS packed but I guess that it just because it is SO GOOD. Their wings and potato skins are my favorite. If I can I like to sit by the bar so I do not have to wait for a table. I have always had the BEST customer service when I have eaten here. I will def. come back here as much as possible. I think they need to open a restaurant in SF so I dont have to drive as far.
Ezzie M.,San Francisco  CA,0,45,2,8/4/2008,1.0,If I could give no stars I would!!!!! The service is the WORST. Get a table right away ... wait 45 minutes only to have a manager to tell me our order was NOT entered. What the Hell is that lame ish????? This place has the worst staff ever. How lame can you be NOT to walk over the machine and enter in a pizza and pasta? Isn't that what you are suppose to do after you take someones order?! Unprofessional - both server and manager.
Martin G.,South San Francisco  CA,308,198,17,8/7/2008,1.0,I have had back to back bad times at this place!!!!! we went at 3pm one day and it was very slow there. we got seated right away  the waitress took our oreder and off she went  My one year old was fine playing and looking at the people around us. we orderd wings  a pasta plate and a kids pizza. 20 mins go by and no food  people were getting seating around us and there food would come right out  when I asked the waitress what was going on she just walked away. At this point my son is crying he is hungry and bored of sitting there. they bring us the food and it is all cold. I as for the manager  and so when we got the manager  he gave us a complementary courtesy card worth $25. Then he even has them bring us a new meal to go. That was fine we go back two weeks later and the same thing happend again this time with the manager giving us two 25 gift cards I say now thanks and walked out. I will not stepping into that place again!!!
Shauna L.,San Francisco  CA,235,100,275,3/14/2009,3.0,it's ight!!! id honestly rather come here to drink rather then eat.. food is okay.. typical american food
homer S.,Brentwood  CA,0,35,2,7/9/2008,1.0,pasta was too cheesy  pizza too oily  cabbage salad was mostly fried strips  and beer was sub-par but cheap. So if for any reason to go it's at the mall and there is cheap beer.
Ryan F.,San Francisco  CA,3,26,4,5/18/2013,1.0,me my mom and my two aunties went there yesterday around 3pm. from the host down to the table and server was so nice... food is great... but the server is not honest.... after we order pizza bj's favorite  2 pasta the chicken alfredo and scampi pasta  beers  soda and tea. my mom paid everything in cash about $90 something and we saw that... the server even opened the check book. then my mom decided to order again in a different check  2 beers and one spicy wings w/c cost only 16 dollars including tax. after that they charge my mom $105 something.... and we called the manager in regards of the issue being double charge w/c we already paid off the first check w/c about 90 something... the manager talked to the server and the server denied that we did not pay him for our first check. i told the manager if he can review the camera coz the server is lying... as a resolved the manager gave us a gift card... and the manager apologies but the server did not even showed up and talk to us in regards of the issue... the server is a liar! that makes the restaurant bad... and i will not go back to that restaurant anymore... instead of giving us the money back for the first charge since they charge us double... they gave us a gift card! what a stupid idea! the server already took the money and bj;s will give us a gift card? its not right! i dont even want to accept the gift card! but since thatbi dont wanna argue in regards of money we let it go!....
Kevin S.,San Francisco  CA,407,1595,278,1/26/2006,3.0,Jeezuz  what happens when you work in a place like this? Do you lose your sense of smell?! You can't tell that one of your bussers is running around with a nasty  sour old dishrag wiping off people's tables and stanking up the place? PLEASE. Wash the damn things out with hot water and let them dry. This is pretty basic! Wipe off the tables so there is no food residue! It's not that hard! A powerful sour dishrag smell nearly flattened my party of four coworkers on our way in here. Not promising. And I'm afraid this place lived up to its lack of promise. Very uneven food--my sourdough (hmmm--sourdishrag?) burger was tasty but way over-lettuced (that shredded  rapid-composting kind of lettuce)  while my friend's clam chowder was bland and his salad unappetizing. Another companion's Asian chicken salad was much zestier. My iced tea was cloudy and more or less flavorless  and sugar was not to be found to sweeten it up. The service was scattershot. It's a cavernous space but seems like it has too few seats for the size of the place. I can't quite put my finger on it. I doubt I'll be back  it's just not worth dealing with the mallish crush.
Marc A.,San Francisco  CA,35,69,,7/8/2008,2.0,come here a lot because it's close to work and open late every night. good place to have some drinks although the food is mediocre kind of on the same level as tgi friday's. try the chicken lettuce wraps with the wasabe hot sauce! the service is also something that needs improvement otherwise a good casual dining environment
Maya L.,San Francisco  CA,104,97,10,3/13/2007,1.0,"My first time here was my first and my last. We went on a Thursday night and the place was packed. I approached the counter and asked for a table for 2. The hostess told me to come back in 10 minutes for a beeper and she took down my name. We went and came back. I asked and there were beepers yet..10 more minutes. My date and I sat for a good 30 minutes (lucky we had good conversation) when I look over at the hostess podium and she is there giving out beepers and buzzing people in. The kicker came when I saw people who came in after us get a beeper right away...I got pissed and went you to the podium and with an attitude (yes  its been 45 minutes at this point)  I ask  ""Where\'s a beeper???"" She gives a funny nervous laugh and goes  ""oh yeah here"". So then we waited another 10 minutes after getting the beeper to be seated. The food was unimpressive and you could get better food anywhere else in the area. The girl who waited on us was sweet but seemed like it was her first day as a waitress and was so nervous. She was nice though and is the only reason I\'m giving this place one star as opposed to none."
D C.,Daly City  CA,149,85,8,10/24/2007,1.0,The service was horrible & the food similar. I've gone to the one in S. Cal 2x and had exceptional service  plus food was decent. We were a party of 5 during lunch time enjoying the 84 degree weather outside seating. Our server took a long time to get to us (most of the lunchtime crowd already gone)  take our order  get our crummy food out (my goddaughter never got her food even after she said she'd check on it)  get the bill. I had gone to the bathroom 2x (lots of water) and there were plenty of servers chit chattin and standing around. When we finally got our salads we didn't get any utensils  so I got some for us. My half sandwich would've been great had they not served it on bread that sucked the saliva out of me. 2 of my cousins got the same  but different sandwiches and neither of them ate 1/4 of it. The only thing that seemed to be a hit were the sliders. Don't come here...we live in an area where there are lovely places to enjoy a solid meal!
carebear l.,San Francisco  CA,16,147,15,8/11/2007,2.0,What I like about this place is that it can accommodate a large group. We had a group of about 9 people with no reservations. We had to wait about 15 to 20 minutes. We went to the bar and had some house beers. I had the blonde beer and it was pretty comparable to a Heifenweizen. When we were seated  the waiter introduced himself promptly. We all ordered from the menu and the food came promptly. I ordered the sliders  they were decent but would have been better if the patty was the actual size of the bun. Yes  the patty to bun ratio was not good. I also asked if the patty could be cooked medium rare. I thought it was a reasonable request. I mean it's a little patty  which doesn't take long to cook anyway and when I asked if it could be cooked medium rare the waiter said the chef usually cooks it well  but he'll write it down that I wanted the patty med. rare. Well  needless to say  the sliders did not come med. rare. My bf ordered the roasted chicken and ribs combo. The chicken was a little dry and the ribs were too. All in all the atmosphere is fun  but the food is nothing to brag about. I would come here with a big group again  not for the food  but for the atmosphere. There is outside seating  which would be good for a big group on a beautiful night.
Jonathon C.,San Francisco  CA,29,92,46,6/1/2008,3.0,this place is great if you go to the bar area. the food is alright but nothing to be excited about. i just enjoy trying out their different variety of beers and catching up with friends there. its always a great atmosphere but sometimes its got its quirks on certain days like bad service or dirty glasses which is common anywhere. the dirty glasses seem to be frequent though so minus one star for that and the service isn't always great so another minus star for that.
Rick H.,Oakland  CA,402,1279,1012,11/27/2005,4.0,"This is indeed an exciting development and welcome addition to the northern Peninsula area  as there are few (if any) large-format microbrew restaurants here. The interior decor is as you\'d expect from a suburban microbrewery-sports pub: a wide open space with gaudy colorful murals  lots of roomy booths  a long bar  numerous flat screen plasma tv\'s lining all the walls playing a variety of sports events and an overall brassy finish. The place has a few flaws as pointed out by family members  never one\'s to keep our opinions a secret. It was duly noted by my cousin that the place had an obvious draft due to the proximity between the front doors and dining floor  the server had to be asked for beverage refills  it was quite boisterous and loud  and the chairs were slippery (hey  don\'t shoot the messenger). Nonetheless  the hot roast beef dip  sourdough burger with bacon and cheddar  and the seasoned wedge fries (""broasted""  according to my uncle) were all very tasty. (And no  I didn\'t order two sandwiches  my mom and I traded halves.)"
Tracy P.,San Francisco  CA,64,62,17,11/26/2006,5.0,My favorite happy hour place. Jeramiah Red rocks and the I love their Cobb Salad.
elmer d.,Daly City  CA,62,170,,12/26/2007,1.0,its jus a place to be seen~no one here knows whats goin on in sports~its a hang out~it figures its south city & no one here is into sports...all this bar has to do is turn up the freakin volume!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....numerous tv's....but no sound....get a clue~its a sports bar....this place would make sooo much money & maybe compete with knuckles....but no sound....ruins the whole experience
KC F.,San Francisco  CA,1,12,1,1/2/2011,3.0,decent food and service. only been here a few times and it was because it was with a group. there is usually a wait time and i am not sure if it is worth it. the pizza here is ok and the sandwiches here are decent. it can get a little pricey but not too bad.
BENITA L.,San Francisco  CA,1,2,,10/30/2010,1.0,DO NOT COME HERE ESPECIALLY DURING THE WORLD SERIES. why are giants fans coming here for the games? to watch and LISTEN to the game on all the TVs that you have placed all around the restaurant. last night EVERYBODY who came to BJs was there for the game (and certainly not for their overpriced skimpy-azz mediocre portions of apps). even after several attempts by various patrons pleaded with the manager  jeff  to turn the volume on (it was only on low in the bar area)  he REFUSED to do it claiming it's not their policy. ok  then why was it on the previous saturday during the giants clinch w/phillies? if i had known that  i mosdef would not have wasted my time going there again. we were all there to cheer on our team. we're not deaf!!! come on  BJs  get with the program!!! this is our Giants in the World Series; doesn't happen every day; make an exception to your dumb rules. none of my friends nor i will ever set foot into that dump again!!!! no stars for u!!!!
J C.,San Francisco  CA,0,35,,11/15/2009,1.0,First  their hostess was rude and sorry to say but stupid. She treated everyone who was waiting for a table like they're bugging her while she stands there doing nothing. We waited our turn while she tells everyone where they should stand. Maybe she's having a bad day but whatever. Then we got seated  waited 30 minutes and no one ever came to tell us thst someone will be with us or what we wanted to drink. We stayed calm and looked around. Everyone who got seated after us already have water. The server saw us but never acknowledged us. It's just water we thought maybe we'll be next but hey no luck. Finally who the hell wants to wait an hour to just get water or be acknowledge that someone will be with us. All these time we asked ourselves if we did anything wrong but we didn't  we waited our turn  when we got seated we said thank you and that was the last conversation we had with someone who works there. IF A MANAGER OR WORKER IS READING THIS SERIOUSLY YOU GUYS NEED TO DEVELOP SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. We finally walked out and went to red lobster and even though they were busy we got seated fast  server acknowledged us that we'll be next and we had a great lunch. Thank God for red lobster.
