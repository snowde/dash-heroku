Management was unorganized, over worked on part-time status, horrible schedule. Worst and most unorganized management ever Abuse workers with time frames regarding breaks/lunches. Unprofessional coworkers(food not prepared correctly/food runners don't read tickets and don't run the whole ticket/buskers only halfway buss tables), circular break rotation, hosts lack knowledge (full section or no tables), relatively no training, hands-off management, and general lac of cooperation between employees. Poor upper management, talk about culture but being nothing to the table. -Lack of discipline for employees who come to work late, no call-no show, call out all the time, don't do their work properly, etc. -Lazy Managers.
