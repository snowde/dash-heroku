Be more holistic in your expectations of your employees, and play by the same rule book. If something isn't allowed, then all of the managers should be on board about enforcing it. Try and make more time for team meetings or one on one reviews. The team meetings always helped remind workers of what they should and shouldn't be doing.

I liked that CCF treated us like adults and gave us respect. A few bad managers changed the whole dynamic, and the restaurant went downhill from back to front.

My management personally tried their hardest to accommodate everyone's preference on a schedule. They also use Hotschedules, an online and interactive scheduling module that allows you to view your schedule, request days off, and switch shifts with a coworker per management's approval. I also made great money working at CF. The high table turn time and moderately sized section helped this. CF does not take reservations, but sits guests on a first come first serve basis to make sure your section is never being wasted. The majority of CFs are located at a mall where the flow of drive-bys and walk-ins is ever constant. CF is very good about promoting internally as well. Although this is an opportunity not presented to myself in my time there, many servers/bakery workers have been promoted to management.","A very large restaurant comes with the cons of just that....large sections. Diverse clientele. Minimal attention from management as they are usually running around with more work than one can handle. You are also working with a very large staff that you must interact and learn how to work with a lot of coworkers. You are also working on other peoples time. When it is busy, shift change can take up to an hour and checking out can take up to an hour as you must wait on a shift lead to check out your side work.

The managers will be respectful and work with you to make sure you work the shifts that you want. When you work a double or help a manger, you get free food too.

This company promotes a lot from within, so if you work hard you can move up.","While there are many pros, there are many cons to consider. Like a lot of restaurants, who you work with can either make your shift amazing or a nightmare, especially with the managers. Hard work is not appropriately recognized, and even if you work hard and give it 110%, most of the time the managers do not acknowledge it or reward you. The bussers are consistently overstaffed, which means you make less money and have a lot of dead time. Because of this, the managers will make you look busy instead of scheduling the right number of people. The dish crew is always running behind, and the managers will make you rack and run your own silverware if they get really behind. Also, when you work a double or help a manger, you'll get a green ticket which you use to get free food. The problem with this is that people who are friends with the managers will get green tickets without even doing anything. Finally, if you wish to move up in the company, you have to have a very flexible schedule. They hold classes for servers/bartenders once every 3-6 months. The class spans over a week and a half with most of them being morning classes. This means that if you are in school or have other responsibilities during the day, you may not be able to move up because of schedule conflicts.

Managers are extremely flexible when it comes to scheduling, there are great opportunities for advancement, and servers, bussers, line cooks, kitchen managers and restaurant managers are friendly and promote a fun and safe working environment. This was easily the best company I have ever worked for in the restaurant industry, and I have been doing this for over 9 years. The opportunity for advancement is second-to-none. As a matter of fact, we, as managers were expected to be constantly training ourselves for promotions. I never heard of any manager that had worked for the company for multiple years that was not promoted. They encourage you to learn as much as you can about the food, culture, and systems. Staff are allowed free soup and bread (something you won't always find at other chains) and there's a meal program that takes a small amount of money out of your paycheck each day that you work and allows you to order most of the items on the menu (because just about everyone would take advantage of ordering the high priced items like the filet mignon or the ribeye). I will sorely miss the people, the managers, and the general attitude of every person I worked with, met, and became friends with while I was employed. Cheesecake Rocks!","The fast pace can be too much for some people and the hours can be long and arduous. As an example, I, as a kitchen manager, worked around 11-14 hours a day and it was exhausting. It was difficult to find the right work/life balance and ultimately I chose life over work. A lot of people in management, because of the long hours and having to work sometimes at home, reported their relationships with their significant other deteriorated and/or ended. While I was there, one of the kitchen managers was going through a rough divorce and a restaurant manager told me about how his wife divorced him because he became a workaholic and he ultimately had to step down as his role as the general manager and was demoted.",The benefits package that came with my salary were great.

Take the time to implement a real system to build relationships with the management teams in they're region , monitor operations. The service check company the company uses are easily skewed and a waste of money. The ethical core is inherently compromised because of systems the company creates. Some GM's abuse their teams and do a little work as possible and alienate managers/staff. Area directors should have more quality circles that are not rigged, loaded with plants. C.I.A. style is the multi million dollar restaurant can often be run. Every location is really impacted by the GM.
