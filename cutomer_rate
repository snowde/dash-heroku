664,Tiffany C.,San Francisco  CA,297,304,306.0,2012-01-03,4.0,I came here a couple of time and usually there is a wait. Most times the wait isnt too bad. However  the last time I came here  it was Monday nightfoot ball. This place is crazy. We made reservations for 6:30 but didnt get seated till 8! Super crazy  but I feel that for football fans its a great place. Everyone cheers when something good happens and yells when something bad happens. Its very spirited and my friends loved it! But personally I just wanted dinner. They have TVs everywhere and I am sure that from every booth anyone can get a good view. I love the deep dish pizza  esp the great white but this time I tried something different. I tried one of the low calories dish and to my surprise it was super delicious too! I forgot the name to the dish but it had grilled fish with rice. I will definitely come back but probably no on a Monday night.,2.76,3.0,2.944,2.7039999999999997,2.9040000000000004
1154,Nancy C.,San Francisco  CA,202,220,71.0,2012-01-08,3.0,"Do try hard to conceal your girlish giggle (I\'m pointing at you  guys) when your server says ""Hello. Welcome to BJ\'s. My name is ______ and I\'m here to service you."" Yeah  I have immature friends. Men: can\'t live with \'em  can\'t send them off on a rocket to Mars. Moving on...What can I say about BJ\'s that hasn\'t already already been stated? The food is decent for mall fare. There\'s nothing outstanding on their menu but it gets the job done if you\'re hungry and you don\'t feel like getting something from the food court. It\'s good for groups if you want to sit for a while and catch up over food.The wait is always super long on Fridays and weekends so you might want to make a reservation if you know you want to eat here with a big group. I\'ve been here many times and nothing has ever stood out enough to me for me to order it again on future visits. I will say that their salads are disappointing though. Stay away from them. The desserts are pretty good but it all sits on the cusp of overly sweet considering how their menu caters to the average American  so too much sugar is pretty much a given. The same applies for most of their food: too much fat  too much grease  too much salt  etc. When you come here  come for convenience and the social aspect. If you\'re here for the food  just expect average American fare along the lines of Elephant Bar and Cheesecake Factory.",2.8,2.99,2.94,2.508,2.9139999999999997
929,Joe L.,Millbrae  CA,203,147,11.0,2012-01-09,1.0,Not a full house but somehow being seated right next to the bar it takes 15 minutes to get a pitcher. It took over 20 minutes for the appetizers to ariive  but there was neither a nofication or apology for the wait. It gets worse  ladies and gents.When it finally comes  the appetizers were lukewarm  obviously from just sitting there for some time. The hyped promotional and cold boneless chicken wings were the size of a fifty cent coin  I kid you not. What a waste of 9 bucks. By far the most worst promotional item I have ever seen and eaten at a chain restaurant. You know it's bad when you think the check would be the fastest thing to get back  but even that took another 10 minutes after I raised my hand like I was in school. It will be a long long time before I return. Geez what happened to this place. It used to be ok but now it's easily the worst BJ's in a 30 mile radius. I get it you're busy so the service can be forgiveable  but terrible food is a no no.,2.76,2.95,2.932,2.34,2.8739999999999997
925,Gen M.,Concord  CA,44,117,6.0,2012-01-15,1.0,I didn't know this time would come [read on if you know what I'm talking about].Two days ago my boyfriend and I wanted to eat out  so we decided to eat here. We ordered the MAC AND CHEESE and deep Dish pizza. I tried it before  but not anymore. After an hour of eatting here  I got sick. Thats right  food poisoning. Nausea  vomiting  watery diarrhea  abdominal pain and cramps  and fever. I got food poisoning from the MAC AND CHEESE I believe. My boyfriend didn't get sick  but me. I had to stay up till 2am to see if it was out of my system. Luckly my boyfriend was so worried that he had to stay up and make sure I'm okay.I never had food poisoning before till now.I don't think I want to go to BJ's anymore. Sorry guys  but it was a bad experience. hope you understand. :(,2.68,2.95,2.924,2.404,2.8420000000000005
976,Anio D.,San Francisco  CA,74,69,2.0,2012-01-15,3.0,I don't frequent these kind of places much  but I agreed to go last time to see a friend I haven't seen in a while. It was a Friday night  of course the place was full. I was given a pager for an hour's wait-- love that it's right across from Barnes & Noble so I had a place to kill some time. Anyway. When my party of 3 was complete upon arrival  we walked around to see if there were bar seats. For a while  we waited and waited. Finally 3 stools opened up  so we cancelled our pager and just ate there. Food was good  and very filling..although I wasn't that hungry. I still ate 3 slices of the deep pan pizza.Service was okay  actually  pretty good for a place that busy. It was a good experience  but personally  I hate crowded places just so I can eat. It's ideal  though  having 2 loud kids and not having to bother louder adults. But that still doesn't convince me to come in regularly.,2.68,2.95,2.92,2.668,2.8420000000000005
1319,Yanni Z.,Daly City  CA,0,6,,2012-01-16,1.0,Well  the reason I gave this place a 1 star because I got food poisoned by their food. I ate burger pizza  spegghi. Mostly I believe it's their can tomato coz both of them have tomato. I felt dizzy and throwed up later. Headache whole day the next day.,2.68,2.91,2.908,2.436,2.8180000000000005
599,Patricia S.,San Francisco  CA,123,13,14.0,2012-01-16,3.0,"Came here with some friends the other day. First off  the waiter was kind of rude. I think his name was Tom but I\'m not sure. We asked for separate tabs and he gave us some look like  ""Uhhh  wtf? Okay? Fine."" Uhhh hello! Some of us like separate tabs so that we don\'t have to deal with who owes who what. Then  my friend gets his chili and it\'s lukewarm! Last time I checked  chili is supposed to be hot. We explained this to the waiter and we get another kind of look except it wasn\'t as obvious. (He probably heard us talking about the first time and giving a low tip because when he would come back  he was more energetic and upbeat with his tone.)So now I get my crispy chicken sandwich with fries. I love their thin-cut fries. Mmmm! As I was eating the sandwich  I noticed that the tomato was MUSH! Gross. It looked like it was a spread on my chicken instead. I tried to take it off but only the rim came off. That\'s how bad the tomato was. C\'mon BJ\'s! If I\'m paying $10 for a sandwich  the least you can do is give me a fresh tomato!And I\'d like to add that another time I came with a group of friends  our waitress was kind but was rushing us. It felt like she was trying to get us out asap. RUDE. About only 30 minutes into our meal  she was already asking us if we needed boxes. We weren\'t even done yet! -___- And this last time (I mentioned above)  our waiter was really slow. I needed a few more minutes to decide what to order  and he comes back like 10 minutes later and it wasn\'t even busy. Now I need a refill which I told him  and I wait another 5 minutes. BJ\'s needs to work on their service!",2.72,2.91,2.904,2.668,2.8340000000000005
1153,Dominique S.,San Francisco  CA,57,13,,2012-01-16,1.0,"Can I say that this is actually a .5 of a star? This place is worthy of my first review for it\'s incredibly rude service. After taking my son to hop and play  my hungry two year old  my disabled husband and two month old were excited to try out BJs. We never go out considering how hard it is as a nursing mother and also with my husbands disability it makes things extremely difficult. They told my husband a table would be ready in 45 minutes and not more than that. After waiting for 47 minutes  we went in to check the status of our table. The girl told us it would be another 20+ minutes. At this point my son was fussing and my daughter was asleep. I asked her ""why did you guys say it was going to be less than 45 min? Now it\'s turned into an hour plus"". She snippily replied ""running time right now is 47 minutes"". I asked her how long take out would be and she said 15 minutes. My son was in his stroller crying while we looked at the take out menu  and while the two hostess talked crap about us right in front of us about how we changed our mind. This pissed me off because I could hear them and the other hostess looked at my son rolling her eyes. She came by with some crayons and paper and gave it to him and said ""your welcome"" what a rude girl! My husband grabbed the crayons and put them on the table because of her rudeness. While we waited for our take out  they persisted with giving me bad looks and starring at my son. We walked and waited outside because of how uncomfortable they made us feel and my husband walked passed the door and heard the hosting bragging to the cashier at the take out corner how she rudely gave the crayons to us to shut my son up. My husband never complains. At this point he walked in and she turned and said ""is there anything I can help you with?"" sweetly. He told her ""no I didn\'t ask you to give us crayons and I didn\'t appreciate that. And I don\'t appreciate you chit chatting to your friend about us either.""Just as he said that  the manager walked into the conversation. We walked outside and the manager apologized. He was nice but didn\'t offer any type of compensation for their rude behavior and our incredibly long wait. It really isn\'t even about the long wait. It\'s really about how these girls continued to talk crap about us while we were there. Yeah it\'s loud in there  but I could clearly hear them. It really ruined my night. It was pretty over priced. I payed 42 bucks for a large bj favorite deep dish pizza and sliders. Then the icing on the cake! My son and I were the only one who ate the sliders...and we got very sick! Like sick to where my two year old was doing projectile vomiting and diarrhea. I was doing the same for 2 days. We were flying out to Hawaii 2 days later and it was the most miserable experience to watch your two year old in pain and you yourself is puking. My husband can only help so much due to his condition. Maybe they did something to my food because I was really pissed? No idea  better to be safe than sorry. NEVER EVER AGAIN!",2.72,2.89,2.892,2.468,2.822
1265,Andrew B.,San Francisco  CA,75,86,,2012-01-18,5.0,"Seriously  what\'s not to love about this place  especially the post-9PM happy hour?!?!I do love BJs Brewhouse. They have great beer  good drinks  and amazing happy hour (mini pizza  mmm). I\'ve been there with friends weekly for several weeks now and love it. The great white is my favorite  it\'s chicken Alfredo pizza.The only advice I\'d give is to avoid the patio. The servers only seem to come around on occasion  and I think it\'s the ""you\'re stuck with the patio"" kinda thing  so they\'re usually not friendly like you get inside. Maybe it was just a couple bad experiences for me  but just an observation.All in all  this is one of my favorite happy hours in the burbs  so I highly recommend both the drinks and the food. And it\'s a lot of fun. If you\'re a sports fan you\'ll love the place too  I\'m not so it\'\'s not a big deal to me.",2.8,2.89,2.904,2.9640000000000004,2.854
921,Adlyn S.,South San Francisco  CA,176,113,35.0,2012-01-19,3.0,"BJ\'s is like that ex-fling that you just keep on going back to for convenience. It hits the spot when needed ;) lol And it\'s named BJ\'s?! There\'s way too many ""That\'s what she said"" jokes for me to handle right now lol. Ok now on to the real review.The servers here are great and my food always comes out in a timely manner. The avocado egg rolls  deep dish pizzas  and pizookies with a cold beer makes up a typical yet fulfilling BJ\'s meal. You really can\'t go wrong with that combo.I have to dock off a star from my recent front of desk experience. Usually when you walk up to the front desk with a hostess doing nothing  you\'d expect a ""Hello! How can I help you?"" instead of a *blank stare* followed with me (THE DAMN PATRON) saying  ""Hi  I have a table for 3"" Clueless hostess  ""There\'s a 45 minute wait. *blank stare*"" So to the 17 to 20 something blank-faced Asian hostess  please remember that you\'re the first face I see when I walk into your establishment and possibly the last so you better be thankful for my business! Btw  it is a mall so I might have been willing to walk around and wait the 45 minutes instead of going across the street to Jack\'s instead. I really hope I don\'t see her pulling the same schtick again.",2.8,2.91,2.908,2.7640000000000002,2.8659999999999997
597,Sid G.,Union City  CA,6,64,150.0,2012-01-20,4.0,This BJ's is a life saver in the area where there are very few choices... The service here usually is prompt...the only thing abt this place is the wait time... The best thing to do is to Their brewery beers are top notch... I like the jermiah and the heff..,2.88,2.93,2.904,2.9280000000000004,2.91
918,Jean T.,San Francisco  CA,96,136,189.0,2012-01-22,4.0,I like this place. Its a great place when we want a casual lunch for my family and none of us can agree on where to go/want to eat. They have a great variety of foods. The quality is decent  lots of flavor.They are a kid friendly kind of restaurant but also a great spot to hang out with friends and watch the game on tv.Service is pretty good  even when they're are busy. But be careful  they dont take reservations so if the place is packed  be prepared to wait 1-2hrs on weekend.,3.0,2.94,2.908,2.9280000000000004,2.9640000000000004
673,Jay H.,Florence  KY,245,235,168.0,2012-01-23,3.0,BJ  Not to bad for a chain food restaurant Brewery. Good place to watch the 49's vs the Giants in the play off 2012 I first order there light draft beer. Not to bad of a taste. We order the sampler it had 4 avocado rolls were very good. Would order this again. The spring rolls and the cheese sticks were OK. Artichoke dip with chips was also OK. Next time I would only order the avocado rolls. The main part of the meal was really good. The cheese burger Pizza. Never ever had that. The crust was really good topping had pickles on it and ground beef peppers onions.Overall above average for a chain brewery. Would go there again to watch one football. Like the atmosphere.,3.08,2.94,2.912,2.732,2.9960000000000004
939,Monica M.,San Diego  CA,66,56,37.0,2012-01-26,3.0,Not too sure how to describe BJ's even though I come here pretty often. It's a good place. It's not like a place where you go often because you can't live without it  it's just a good restaurant that's close by and has some good selections. My favorite food to get are their appetizers. I love their avocado egg rolls and potato skins! Pizookies are good too  but I don't get them too often :]. My favorite pizookie is probably the white chocolate macadamia nut or oreo. I just wish they had happy hour.Service can go both ways  but it's typically normal. The prices could be around $8-$12 for an entree.The wait could be long/short depending on the time of day you go. Nights are typically the busiest. But  they do allow you to put your name on waitlist  so that's good.,3.04,2.94,2.904,2.668,2.9800000000000004
1564,Jasper N.,Daly City  CA,0,4,,2012-01-26,4.0,went here for a friends birthday party. overall good food and our waiter was chill. the burgers and sandwiches are huge! i got a pulled pork and it was amazing.,3.0,2.95,2.912,2.768,2.9700000000000006
1563,Customer L.,San Francisco  CA,0,14,,2012-01-27,4.0,Even though they were super busy on Sunday  the service and food was good. However  waitresses speak so FAST. Sometimes  hard to catch it up.,3.04,2.96,2.924,2.768,2.9920000000000004
879,Jeremy C.,South San Francisco  CA,60,26,,2012-02-05,3.0,Do you like waiting an hour and a half for a table? Well if you do  then you have found the perfect spot for dinner! Don't worry  if they tell you that you're table will be ready in 30 minutes  you'll get to wait 90 instead. Gives you plenty of time to go to the Asian store a few stores down and rub some Buddha belly.As for the actual restaurant  we got put in the back on a Friday night. The waitress was very busy and before getting our drinks or taking our orders  she kept reminding us that she was very busy and would take longer to do her job.I ordered a pizza and a cream soda. The cream soda is BJ's own concoction which costs $2.99. The trick is  drink as much as possible. The idiots that I ate with also ordered drinks but only got maybe 1 refill. I got 3 refills so my cost per glass turned out to be only 75 cents. It's like printing cash.The pizza was ok. I shared a large with a friend and there were a few slices left over. On that topic  when someone says a couple  what number does that represent? I always thought a couple meant 2  but having that discussion  other people said that they think a couple stands for 3. I think they are morons. End of story.Oh....for the pizza  the waitress couldn't find Parmesan cheese.I don't come here often but when I do  I always regret it.,3.12,2.94,2.924,2.604,3.0120000000000005
808,Liz W.,Boston  MA,137,276,227.0,2012-02-10,2.0,PIZOOKIE!!!! & Pizza...the only 2 good things about this place.The lady at the front that seated us was so RUDE and AWKWARD. She was uninviting and when she seated us  there was greasy food on the seat. I pointed it out to her (she didn't even notice...) and she merely brushed a few pieces off with her hand. The GREASE remained. I asked if she could wipe it down  she rudely walked away came back with a NAPKIN and BARELY wiped it. The entire time she had the look of disgust and anguish on her face. The WORST customer service EVER.Thank god the food was alright  we had a pizookie  pizza  and jalapeo burger. The burger was a 2/5  pizookie 5/5 as always  and pizza 4/5. But the lady was so rude that this place just doesn't deserve a higher rating.,3.04,2.95,2.92,2.536,2.9860000000000007
835,Stephanie M.,San Francisco  CA,18,95,42.0,2012-02-12,3.0,I love their Nutty Brewnette. It's spicy and hoppy and it makes me sneeze but I still heart it. Now for the longest run-on sentence of your life: I've tried the Spinach and Artichoke Dip (tasty  but I wish it came with bread)  Avocado Egg Rolls (good)  Original Roast Beef Dip Sandwich (solid and filling)  BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich (tasty but too much bun)  Buffalo Chicken Pizza (flavor is good but I'm not a fan of deep dish)  Spaghetti with Spicy Tomato Sauce (I add chicken)  New Orleans Jambalaya (huge portion but it's a little dry)  Miso Salmon (the citrus glaze is crazy sweet  blech)  Old-Fashioned Pot Roast (the portion could stand to be a little bigger). If your meal comes with fries  the wedges can't be missed.You know what used to taste awesome but was unceremoniously removed from the menu? The meatloaf. WHY? WHY DID YOU TAKE IT OFF THE MENU?! (A server actually told me a man became so angry it disappeared he yelled at the restaurant in general  slammed his menu on the table and stormed out. That's how good it was.)Atmosphere is typically semi-dark and bustling. Food is sorta pricey but usually portions are big. The servers are pretty on point about asking if you need help and bringing you extra stuff you ask for (aka Tabasco  more ranch  etc.). Waits can be horrendous  especially Fri-Sun when parents bring their six kids. I'll always find it strange going to places where there are giggling kids at one table and yelling single drunk chicks literally 10 ft. away. I really wish they would let me rate places half stars because I think this place is a solid 3.5.Side note: whoever designed the Tanforan parking lot needs to be punched in the balls (or the uterus  I don't want to be sexist here).,3.0,2.95,2.924,2.636,2.9700000000000006
1252,Shaw S.,Daly City  CA,0,4,,2012-02-17,1.0,Never coming to this place again! After waiting half an hour to be seated  our waiter was rude and not a people person. She seated us and didn't ask for our drinks or anything. So we waited another 30min assuming she would come around and ask what drinks we wanted. But NO. We had to call her over. The only good thing about this place is there pizookie. Its just as good as the cookies and creme. I highly recommend red velvet. Come here only if you want your time wasted  tasteless food  and slow service.,2.84,2.93,2.92,2.468,2.894
1209,Frances V.,South San Francisco  CA,22,183,245.0,2012-02-17,3.0,BJ's is a good place to hang out for happy hour  that is if you are able to grab a table in the bar area and come early enough to. They have a large selection of beers (microbrews and imports) and wide selection of appetizers and entrees. Otherwise  there is nothing that really stands out here. Just your typical local restaurant and hangout spot. But I will always make room for their pazooki when I come here.,2.88,2.92,2.916,2.668,2.904
1210,Julia R.,San Mateo  CA,32,83,63.0,2012-02-17,3.0,The food is tasty but the service is just awful. Either waiting for someone to take your take out order or if dining inside  its always SO SLOW! They have a wide range of food on the menu and everything is pretty delicious  the pizza's are pretty good as well  if only you could get some better servers then this place would be great!,2.88,2.92,2.916,2.668,2.904
906,Brian A.,San Bruno  CA,137,221,,2012-02-19,3.0,"This place is growing on me. I really like the beer  especially the tatonka stout. In fact most of the beer here is good. My second favorite is the brown ale.This seems to be my go to for when I\'m in a ""I want to go out for a beer but don\'t want to drive too far"" mood. Also can\'t hate too much on a place with HH after 10 pm.Now the food is still of the hit or miss variety. Every now and then I\'ll get surprised by a dish or an appetizer  but more often then not the food is mediocre.... especially the pizza... the pizza is always mediocre.If I was just giving a review for the brews  I\'d give this place 4 stars. Unfortunately the food drags it down to either 2 or 3 star level.",2.88,2.92,2.912,2.7,2.904

The service was a little slow and the gave me the wrong pizza. took me some time to get the right order but when i did the manager was the one to bring me my food and apologize he also paid for my food and dessert to make up for it! this place also has real good beer!

1361,Annette Y.,San Francisco  CA,91,9,39.0,2012-02-22,3.0,Came here Sunday evening  about half an hour+ wait and ordered the roasted turkey cobb sandwich with wedge cut fries and a root beer. The root beer was a bit flat to start and the fries were yummy but some of them were kinda hard to chew? The sandwich was delicious UNTIL I got to my second half and WTF.. Is that PLASTIC in my sandwich?!! I pulled it out of my mouth and the turkey was stuck to the plastic. (apparently the turkey comes wrapped in plastic) i told the waiter  he apologized and alerted the manager who then also apologized and said it will be taken off the bill. Anything else they can get me? Uh.. No thanks! 3 stars because before the plastic the sandwich was actually good plus the way they handled it.. I guess I should credit them for that.. Yay for customer service! I would probably go back again.. I'm sure this was just a one time mishap...,2.88,2.93,2.924,2.636,2.91
796,Jessica A.,San Francisco  CA,605,215,416.0,2012-02-22,1.0,Yeah  I KNOCKED DOWN TWO STARS from my previous visit. I feel like my experiences here keep getting worse & worse. BUT..a different situation. I didn't even physically make it to BJ's & still had a bad experience. What's up with that?!Okay  so it was a Friday evening two week ago & my family wanted to go to a mini-celebratory dinner. I have the number saved on my phone  so I decided to call ahead for a party of 5. I called a little before 6:30pm & was told that the wait would be 1-1.5 hours. I put my name down. It was super busy on the streets & freeway  so it took awhile to get in the area. Before exiting  I called to see how the wait was at that moment since a bunch of time had passed since I called. I was told that the hostesses were busy  so whoever answered the phone would check himself. Let me put it out there now..I WAS ON THE PHONE FOR 16 MINUTES!!!! (yelp.com/biz_photos/FMGN) I'm a pretty patient person to wait that long  but 16 MINUTES just to see what our wait is?! & I got PUT ON HOLD THREE TIMES & had to ASK THE SAME THING TWICE. Also..I came to find out THAT I WASN'T EVEN PUT ON THE LIST IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!! What's the point of having a call-ahead service?!!? I don't care that it's a busy Friday night..if you're going to advertise the call-ahead option  GO BY IT & PUT PEOPLE DOWN!!! I was so fed up on the 3rd hold that I just hung up & WE TOOK OUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!!!Way to bring down the mood. I was in a really good mood..hence the MINI-CELEBRATORY DINNER...but yes BJ's  YOU RUINED IT!! Who makes a customer wait 16 MINUTES..actually MORE than that since I got so fed up that I hung up. I don't know anyone else who'd wait on hold for 16 minutes for ANY business. That's just ridiculous. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE..even over the phone.I have yet to go back & not really sure if I even want to anymore. The service keeps getting worse & I'm not even sure that it's worth it. Maybe the drive to another location is more worth it.,2.76,2.9,2.916,2.404,2.844
695,Joyce E.,Daly City  CA,135,1018,2084.0,2012-02-27,4.0,I really don't have anything to complain about except the wait! The wait usually averages to be about 1 hour-1.5 hours depending on the time  day  and amount of people in your party. Good food  decent prices  amazing service  and amazing rootbeer and pizzookies!

1185,Denny P.,San Jose  CA,216,30,1.0,2012-02-28,3.0,In all honesty I think that the better BJ's are located in the South Bay because after coming here  the service was just aaaite and the food is never anything to be excited about. It is a chill place to come with a few buddies to have lunch and catch up or talk about whatever but for the most part it's nothing more than mediocre at best.,2.88,2.91,2.936,2.668,2.8979999999999997
1529,Dan L.,Eden Prairie  MN,0,60,,2012-02-28,3.0,Frustrating restaurant. Sometimes the service is good and other times  just terrible. The food is usually good  or at least what comes out is what was ordered  but occasionally  the food is just not good. Their clam chowder is usually great. They have some great prices on lunch items. I work nearby and come fairly often  so I guess there has to be some misses when you come here a lot  but when this place misses  it seems to miss by a lot. But I will return.,2.96,2.91,2.94,2.732,2.9299999999999997
1130,Stacey D.,Mesa  AZ,352,206,86.0,2012-03-01,2.0,Hey bartender...my AZ ID is not fake...and I can hear you as you stand in front of me questioning if you should get a manager or if passports are easy to fake. What a horrible way to start my dining experience. Ever hear of whispering or going somewhere else to have your incompetent discussion? Tact is not everyone's strong suit. Food was just ok - lettuce wraps are decent. I asked for more peanut sauce  but it never came. I sat that the bar since it was just myself  but think I would have got better service in the dining area. Not going back any time soon...,2.92,2.91,2.94,2.568,2.9139999999999997
1234,Jennifer W.,San Francisco  CA,205,7,,2012-03-03,2.0,I'm only giving this place two stars because my waiter was nice. Other than that  I had a party of 10 and we waited for 2hours. Even then  we had to ask and annoy in order to get our table. When we finally got our table  THEY DIDN'T HAVE THREE OF THE PASTA ENTRIES. This place is ridiculous. I do not recommend coming here.,2.96,2.9,2.936,2.6000000000000005,2.924
903,Jade D.,Daly City  CA,41,100,74.0,2012-03-07,3.0,"I hate Waiting to get seated  of all the places BJ\'s is the worst. It\'s effin ridiculous. I came here with my friend  and as we were waiting  somehow we were the last ones STILL waiting. Supposedly  they ""buzzed"" our beeper  but I swear  that didn\'t work. I doubt they did  but they claimed too. They apologized  and after almost an hour  we finally got seated. FINALLY.Ordered half/half of their great white pizza  which is really dee-lish! (and another half of their Sweet Pig. That was just alright to me.) I love their chicken wings  with ranch sauce  bruschetta  and their alcoholic beverages are pretty good too  but I haven\'t had a drink in forever. Oreo pizookie is a must  when dining out here  otherwise you\'re missing out! Our waiter was really nice  and did a great job serving us. Yay to that  Boo to getting seated! It\'s a good spot to come here with friends  or your kids since it\'s a loud environment. First date  don\'t think so. Look elsewhere.",2.96,2.91,2.936,2.668,2.9299999999999997
824,Erica L.,San Carlos  CA,158,428,90.0,2012-03-11,4.0,I like their pizzas  especially the bbq chicken and great white. I recently tried their new portabello mushroom pizza and that was good too.-meatloaf! is really good here. I ordered that for the longest time  but I think i ate it too often. -fries are great here. i like both their crispy thin and wedges! so hard to decide!-artichoke dip is always great appetizer to share with friends. -BEER- im not a beer drinker but i do like BJ's light beers. Cocktails here are not worth it. its so small.-pizookie.... so Fattening!!! but so good! i love the which choc macadamian nut!!Service is okay. Sometimes too slow. This is a great sports bar  I came here one time to watch a Giants game and they let us sit there for 3 hours! But if you want to catch the game. come early to get a table  it gets pretty crazy!,3.08,2.91,2.944,2.7039999999999997,2.9780000000000006

1057,M J.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,0,174,301.0,2012-03-16,4.0,"My coworkers brought me here a couple of days ago for an ""Admin Lunch and Movie Day"". I didn\'t know what was good to order  so it took me quite a while to look over their menu and decide. I\'m a heavy eater so I ordered their pot roast. It came with white cheddar mash potato and vegetables. It was yummy! I don\'t like too much gravy  so that kind of killed my plate. We ended up ordering their dessert since we had time to spare before our movie started. They\'re famous for their ""pizookie"" (soft  mushy pie cookie in an aluminum pan). I love red velvet  so I ordered their red velvet pizookie. It was a little sweet for me having too much sweet cream cheese and white chocolate chunks. It would have been perfect if it was a little harder. No harsh complaints about BJ\'s. Don\'t really have too much here in the bay area. They\'re all scattered and far from where I live though.",3.12,2.94,2.964,2.48,3.0120000000000005

1668,Tastebud S.,Union City  CA,0,48,,2012-03-18,1.0,Each and everytime I come here  whether a Tuesday afternoon  it seems to always be busy. This business does not allow any reservation unless it's for a party of 9. Well here is how I rate this business. It's based on location/parking  service  price  quality/taste of the food  cleanliness. Alright here it is. Location/parking of course it's in the Tanforan Shopping Mall so parking is difficult. I usually end up finding parking farther from the entrance and more closer to the El Camino Real street. Service is like horrible. Waiter/waitress would try to be nice and friendly but getting them to come to your table once you have been seated takes another 10-15 minutes. So I would end up just placing all my orders and not try to order the drinks like they would normally do once they approach your table. And then the other thing was that it takes them 30 minutes to make Mac-N-Cheese for a child. Now give me a break  it looks like the pre-packaged microwavable Mac-N-Cheese. So why it took so long I could not tell you but I had to get the manager involve. He too could not give me an answer as to why it took so long to get it ready  when I specifically as for it to brought to our table as soon as it was done because I had a child who was hungry. I did also mention that to them. But of course that didn't matter to there establishment. So if you have a child who is diabetic  don't even try taking him/her here or otherwise they would end up in the hospital. Price for what in on there menu is not at all worth the money. I mean  come on  Mac-N-Cheeses is that even worth $6 or more? It came slightly over microwaved because it was almost dried out of the cheese. Quality/taste of the food  well as I mentioned already  it's not cracked up to be with what others have rated this business. Cleanliness it one thing that is good which is why I give them this 1 star rating. Sorry  for the being honest but I hate to read reviews and then finding out the opposite. Now other yelpers have given good ratings for a Pizookie. Now it's not that great. It's just a chocolate chip cookie with an ice-cream on top. There is nothing special about that. The twice that we have ordered this so-called pizookie  it was hard (over-cooked) cookie. I could hardly cut it with a spoon or fork to give some to my son. I can go on with food we have ordered that did not cut-it or even worth the time it took or the price for it. So let's just say this is not something to brag about to someone because you might be looked upon that person as not having good taste for the right type of restaurant.,3.04,2.94,2.968,2.18,2.9800000000000004
802,Maggie C.,Walnut Creek  CA,42,253,8.0,2012-03-19,1.0,Probably my worst dinner experience ever!I'm sure they don't care about this review as their line is constantly out the door. I guess most families will not go to Hooters which is why they are all here. Go to the food court if you must eat inside the mall. On a Friday night  we've waited 1hr 45mins for our table and we sat in one of the booth. Since we had movie tickets  we wanted to be sure we can get out of there on time. Service was slow and our server did not check on us at all. We need them to run our credit cards so that we can get outta there so we waved down another server. This rude guy refused to take it but then finally took it with an upset and annoyed look. We've ordered majorly fried food entrees thinking you can't mess that up. Boy we were wrong  they tasted they were fried while they were still frozen  it has no flavor  completely over-fried and very salty. I ordered fried shrimp and I would've guess I ate fried plastic. The cheese on their pizza chews and tastes like rubber. Is that industrial grade chhese? Gross. The appitizer sampler was $16 and came with very little food. I do not understand why people keep coming back and wait 1hr+ for food that's worst tasting than McDonald's but three times the price.,2.96,2.9,2.956,2.2760000000000002,2.924
1466,Efrain T.,Pacifica  CA,46,146,45.0,2012-03-25,3.0,Why do the appetizers always show up at the same time as the entrees? Even if I ask the waiter/waitress that I want to start off with an appetizer  they either bring it with the entree or completely forget it. Last visit  our Jay Baruchel-looking waiter delivered our pizza without our salad and fried artichoke appetizers. The artichokes came about 10 minutes after the pizza but we decided to cancel the salad. Granted the pizza is still good  but I think I might have to avoid going on the weekends because the staff doesn't seem to have their A-game.,2.96,2.9,2.956,2.476,2.924

I have past by BJ's to many many times and have not eaten there... Except for buying a souvenir beer mug during the holidays of 2011 and used the restrooms many many times... Butttt until today  I finally walked in into BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse on a sunday night which was still day light with my family... When I got inside it was a little crowded at the time... The hostess told us it would be a half hour wait in which it didnt take that long of a wait... There were alot of customer that have left BJ's so that gave us a table of four without waiting that long... When we got seated by the hostess in which so was very friendly!!! As soon as we sat at the table... I was ready and I ordered myself a Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak... Which came out nice and hot I definitely would wanna come back to try another item to munch on the next time I come back... And one more thing like in some of my other yelp reviews... The restrooms of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse of San Bruno isnt that bad... I have used it before and it isnt really really that dirty!!!,2.96,2.9,2.956,2.576,2.924

I had it for the first time today and that sucker is dangerous! I probably could've eaten a deep dish sized portion to myself. I like the Oreo flavor! Nomnomnom. It's really hit or miss with the service. The wait time is highly unpredictable. It ranges from no wait to hours. So be aware. Parking can be difficult  but that's expected because it's located in a shopping center. My rec for pizza is their Great White. I get it every single time.,2.92,2.89,2.956,2.6399999999999997,2.902
621,Brandon Y.,San Jose  CA,821,599,1124.0,2012-03-27,2.0,It was one of my first happy hours with co-workers about a week ago  and I was looking forward to appetizers and drinks after a long day of work  so we decided to come to this BJ's.There weren't too many people there on a Wednesday afternoon  so seating 12 of us was rather easy  except for how we had to squish everyone in at those high tables. $2 off appetizers was nice  and I got potato skins  which were surprisingly good with the sauce they provided..it kind of tasted like a bleu cheese dressing almost  but that  along with the company was probably the best part of the gathering.BJ's Blonde Ale was just alright  and I finished it pretty quickly  but the trouble came when the waitress delivered the check...first  she refused to split the check by person and then gave us a max of 6 transactions  forcing a lot of us to use cash. Not only that  but after we figured out how much everyone owed with tax and tip included  we put the amount we wanted charged on each card on the receipt. Upon getting the cards back  not only did the waitress charge someone twice  but there was tip added on to the amounts that we had written down  and cash was given in a ten and a five dollar bill...we were so confused as to why she did not take the cash and charged what we had asked on the cards. Being way too confusing to work out each individual person's  we just coped with it and attempted to split the cash afterwards  but that latter part of happy hour was mostly raised eyebrows and arms as to why the waitress did this...I guess next time  we'll just have to come with less ppl so it is less confusing for them?...hrm.,2.92,2.87,2.948,2.3760000000000003,2.8899999999999997

Some of our favorites on the menu come from the appetizer list. Specifically - the avocado egg rolls  the chicken wings and the artichoke dip. Don't forget to grab a cider and ale pitcher! I also recently had my first pizookie from BJ's evarrr. My tastebuds were thoroughly delighted. Great spot to take a group of friends.

Last I came here was last week with my sis priscilla and we only ordered our fave pizookies that we were craving so much that week. This place is a great spot to watch sports and talk smack about our boyfriends ha. Lol jk but the staff is so-so  sometimes you get the waiter who disappears for twenty minutes and then remembers to take your order or the one who never comes back to give you a refill or you get the waiter thats on top of her shit ready to order you up a storm lol. so like I said.... hit or miss. Foods awesome never had a complaint... sometimes its crazy packed but what bjs isnt? And prices are reasonable. I Loooove their pizookies and the stuffed mushrooms. My usual is the grilled chicken pasta or the turkey club. If I am feeling like a fatty I will order the rack of pork ribs. Any way cool place to be with your best friends or fam. The one time I drove over here alone to get a bite to eat was my last because I had some old dude insist that he take me out after lunch and insisted that he walk me back to my car ....that for sure wont ever happen again...but if you decide to come alone thats cool too. 3 stars because the service isnt always on point.,3.0,2.87,2.952,2.412,2.9220000000000006

I really believe that if you're nice to them that they are nice to you. I come here often so it's very seldom that I get someone grumpy. This review mostly goes out to Ruben  James and Christina (which is why I gave them 5 stars). They are my 3 absolute favorites here. They are ALWAYS so friendly and they make me happy. Ruben and James also bartend and they make my drinks perfect every time. They take care of their people and I appreciate it so much. BJ's is VERY busy almost all of the time so I don't mind if I have to wait around. This place really doesn't get you in and out all the time. If you're not prepared to wait then don't come here.

1180,Mr P.,San Francisco  CA,11,53,10.0,2012-05-02,3.0,Went to BJ's in San Bruno last night for the first time. We ordered a Roast Beef Dip and the Mahi Tuna shown above  along with a couple beers which were wonderful. My dip was good  but sadly the cook had burned the Mahi until the corners were black. It was tough  not juicy and lost all its flavor. It was very busy so it was difficult to track down our waitress  but we did and she ordered up a second round of the Mahi cooked properly. It took an additional 15 minutes to get the second plate of Mahi  but it was cooked perfectly. It was excellent. Even though the waitress did an excellent job serving us  I was dissapointed there was no discounmeal for the poorly cooked Mahi the fist time  not even 10%. Dinner overall was good though  but I might hesitate going back.,3.0,2.81,2.956,2.412,2.886
1542,Jenny A.,Daly City  CA,1,10,,2012-05-02,1.0,My husband and I use to frequent this restaurant quite often. However  in the past couple of years the food quality has gone down hill. We would often order deep dish pizzas. The food would be delivered lukewarm with a thin layer of tomato sauce to cover the dough. The cheese would barely be melted and the crust would not be cut all the way through. For all these reasons  we have stopped eating at this restaurant.,2.96,2.81,2.948,2.148,2.87
1035,Alessa S.,Daly City  CA,29,5,,2012-05-02,1.0,"DISCLAIMER: This review is in regards to large events/parties at this location. 1) LIMITED RESERVATIONS FOR FRIDAYS AND WEEKENDS: You have to work with the time they have available for large parties. Because of the busyness at night  they generally only do reservations on Fridays and Saturdays during the lunch/late afternoon schedule  which is really difficult on a Friday considering a majority of people in our party are working  and don\'t get off until 6:00PM. As result  I had to schedule the dinner for a Thursday night. 2) UNPLEASANT STAFF: In arriving at the restaurant  the manager approached a waiter to let him know he would be handling our party. Since finding out  the waiter (I wish I could recall his name and will update once I find it) along with another employee obviously did not want to serve our party. This was apparent in the fact that I heard them talking amongst one another about the burden of serving our large party and the constant disgruntled stares I received which made me feel VERY unwelcomed and uncomfortable. 3) RUDE SERVER: The 1 star review is mainly in part to the HORRIBLE service we received. I understand that our server was unhappy with serving our party  but he didn\'t need to make it so apparent. After the dinner  many people in our party expressed how un-attentive and just plain RUDE our server was. He had an attitude with every one of our guests  which was unnecessary. (Again  once I get his name  I will update) 4) NO BIRTHDAY PIZOOKIE: One of the perks of having a birthday at BJ\'s is you receive a birthday pizookie. Towards the middle-end of dinner I asked our server to please bring out the pizookie with the candle. 30+ minutes pass  it never comes. As he\'s walking by me handing out to-go boxes  I tell him that they never brought it out. He tells me  ""Oh yes  let me go check on it."" Another 30 minutes pass  he comes back with the bill  NO pizookie. I give him my card to pay  and tell him a THIRD time to bring out the pizookie. He takes the bill with my card and says  ""Let me go get it..."" I must have missed him  because when I come back to our table the copy of our check is there and our server LEFT FOR THE NIGHT. NO thank you  NO bye  and NO birthday pizookie for my boyfriend after asking THREE times for it. I then tell another server who walks by that our original waiter never brought it out  and still it never comes. To add insult to injury  upon gathering our things and walking out  another server approaches us at the exit with a to-go tin and says  ""Here\'s your pizookie... TO-GO."" No ice cream  no candle  and cold in a box. What really upset me is the fact that they were never planning on bringing it out while we were there and had it waiting in a to-go box.*The only PRO is the food and alcohol selection they offer at the restaurant. Horrible service and was constantly ignored by the servers! I definitely do not plan on having a large group/party at this location again. For the amount of money and business we gave them  NOT WORTH IT.*",2.88,2.78,2.94,2.148,2.82

This burger was pretty awesome. So much meat and so much toppings and the chipotle mayo (but next time I will ask for it on the side because there was a bit too much mayo). Fries were also awesome. Thick cut wedge fries... MMmmmmm. This burger was so big that I wasn't able to finish it. I gave my bf the other half and still was stuffed after. I soo recommend this!New Orleans Jambalaya $15.50: This was also really good  a lot of peppers (so if you don't like peppers  don't order this dish). The shrimp is also big enough to notice and taste. Downside to this dish is that they didn't cut the sausage up completely  so you get one whole sausage slices connected by the outer skin... no bueno. But dish was full of flavor.Service is really slow  we didn't get our drinks tell really late and didn't get our check for the longest time. We started to get anxious because we had a movie to get to.,2.72,2.75,2.924,2.508,2.7380000000000004
857,Lisa K.,San Francisco  CA,85,1024,20.0,2012-05-08,2.0,We had take out at a work event  so I didn't have to deal with a wait  but also didn't get to have beer. The food has a fairly nasty Applebeeish vibe to it - everything is saltier and greasier than it needs to be. I personally found the 'pizookie' to not be worth eating and the avocado eggrolls were an abominable waste of an oddly decent avocado. The best I can say might be that the jambalaya was edible. I'll avoid this restaurant in the future.,2.64,2.76,2.928,2.44,2.712
1176,Rich P.,Antioch  CA,68,653,133.0,2012-05-11,4.0,Outside patio is super nice on a sunny afternoon. Try the Great White  or the Buffalo Chicken pizza. I also really liked their new beer - hop-something-or-other. At any rate  it's really good. give it a shot. I also tried the watermelon and feta salad. Grubbin!,2.6,2.77,2.932,2.544,2.702

1271,Edward W.,Cotati  CA,1,4,,2012-05-16,1.0,"Worst! Ordered all you can eat soup and salad  received 1 soup and 1 salad before our waiter disappeared for 25 minutes. Asked another waiter for refills  got the ""I\'ll let your server know"" line. After finally locating our waiter (my sister YELLED \'Hey dude!\' across the restaurant to get his attention)  he said he would be right back with refills. This never happened. The next time he appeared was when he was apologizing to the table next to us for mixing up their credit card with another table\'s and charging the wrong amount. He then asked them if it was OK if he left it that way! When he finally brought our check (still no refills)  we insisted that he take the soup and salad off. He did  and also stated quote ""Sorry  I\'m not a very good server."" LOL! He then reassured us that it was OK if we didn\'t leave a tip. Thank goodness... I was torn about that HA!

However  I do come here at night after work (after 10pm) and the wait is pretty terrible.The food is okay  nothing amazing. Happy hour is awesome  but service and waiting to be seated is pretty bad. Especially if you are at the first come first serve bar area. They usually forget to give me a menu and then after we hunt down menus for ourselves  it takes another 20 minutes before they get our orders and then another 20 for the food to show up. If I knew of many other options for late night dining  I'd be elsewhere for sure. I am hungry at after work!,2.72,2.78,2.94,2.412,2.7560000000000002

I once left my backpack under the table and ran back to get it  and they kept it safe in the back for me. The wait can be long  but my bf and I usually try to snag a bar seat cuz it's first come first served. I'm hopelessly in love with their red velvet pizookie  and orange twist drink!

I love the atmosphere  especially when a local team is playing and the games are on. I was there for lunch on Memorial Day Monday and seriously waited 15 minutes for WATER. It was another 10 minutes for a pint of beer. It was busy  but not out of control busy so the fact that it was 35 minutes for our food to come out was basically unacceptable.,2.72,2.81,2.948,2.2800000000000002,2.774

1536,tina b.,San Bruno  CA,0,12,,2012-05-31,1.0,Will not return; once again  last evening waited over 90 minutes for a table  only to leave without eating. Too long of a wait; impossible to get into the bar and sit. When we decided we had enough  we gave up and handed the pager back to the reservation desk girls. They never apologized for the wait; nor asked us to stay; it was just 2 less patrons that they would have to deal with. Never again  will we go back there. It does not matter if it is 1:00 PM in the afternoon or 8:30 PM at night. They could of doubled the space of this restaurant  and it still wouldn't of been enough to accomodate. This was a total BJ alright.,2.56,2.77,2.94,2.308,2.686

We realized we had over an hour to kill. We were both a little hungry so we decided to check out BJ\'s. We\'ve been to BJ\'s before  but this was our first time at this location. There were a LOT of people waiting  so I was pleasantly surprised when we got a table for two in less than 10 minutes. I loved the layout--its a smaller location (because its attached to the mall) but they had a lot of ""mini-booths"" that just sit 2 people. Bro and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza and a tomato and mozzerella small salad. I also ordered a root beer. OMG everything was soooooooooooo yummy! The service was super quick and our food was scrumptious! I was only sad because I didn\'t have room for pizookie :(",2.6,2.78,2.944,2.6719999999999997,2.708
769,V U.,Daly City  CA,81,152,5.0,2012-06-03,3.0,This story is based on actual facts. My cousin visited from the Philippines and I wanted him to experience all the things in my city that were worth eating. Have you tried a pizookie?No.. What's that? A Peezookey?*Dead silence as I gasp in disbelief*Two days later  he's scooping warm gooey soft chewy cookie with vanilla ice cream in his mouth and is staring at me in bewilderment. Where has this been my whole life!I'm telling myself the same exact thing.. Now  he dreams about pizookies. Sure  they might be a little overhyped but their delicious. And it only took me til now to realize that pizookie is a short for pizza cookie. Lol,2.64,2.77,2.944,2.508,2.718
801,Stella Y.,Los Angeles  CA,786,639,501.0,2012-06-06,4.0,Things I love: Happy hour!!On a lonely Monday afternoon  I grabbed a couple people for happy hour because I was craving a mojito. I got the white peach mojito which just hit the spot. It was sweet enough that you can only taste a hint of peach and mint but not too sweet that it tastes like syrup. $5 at happy hour.. I'm sold. Also got the artichoke and spinach dip ($2 off) that came out hot and gooey and big enough to share with many people. Also got 3 mini pizzas (half off)- vegetarian  3 meat  white pizza. Each incredibly good in their own way; cooked to perfection and just enough cheese. Deep dish always has a place in my stomach. One thing to note that is if you go to happy hour  it's free seating at the bar. I love how our waitress didn't even know that after we asked her. Also  service is basically non-existant. I don't mind that it's busy but try not to have me flag you down when you haven't come to my table for 15 min to take my order or give me my bill.,2.68,2.8,2.944,2.6079999999999997,2.7520000000000002
766,Alyssa S.,San Mateo  CA,133,120,,2012-06-07,3.0,"I wish people would stop celebrating their birthdays here. During my college years  I came here WAY too often. If I had it my way  I\'d opt for Hooters instead. Their menu  while extremely (and over-overwhelmingly) extensive  is pretty average if you ask me. I can say that everything that I\'ve tried there isn\'t something that makes me go ""YES that\'s what I want every single time"" (which is what I usually do when I like something--very Sheldon-esque). Plus the food is overpriced and the wait is freakishly long. Its advantage over the one in San Mateo/Foster City is that at least it\'s in Tanforan and I can do some shopping while I wait.The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars over 2 stars (and really the main reason why I ever go to any BJs) is strictly for the pizookie. Hot chocoloate chip cookie with some ice cream on top? TO DIE FOR. Why can\'t all restaurants just offer this so I don\'t have to resort to BJs? I recently tried the red velvet white chocolate chip pizookie. Also very good but a little too sweet even for this sweet tooth so I\'ll still with the classic moving forward.Other positives: beer selection is awesome  there\'s an abundance of TVs  and their Happy Hour makes it worthwhile (but its only available in the bar area which fills up quickly).I will say  service has always been decent. Nothing bad to report with that. Just the food in general is just MEH.",2.72,2.82,2.94,2.508,2.7800000000000002

The beers are extremely tasty too.The ribs were a huge disappointment and the calzone I had on my last visit was ok. I hope to try their deep dish pizza next  but I have yet to try a dish that is incredible. They do have a huge menu so I'm bound to connect with something.,2.68,2.8,2.948,2.54,2.7520000000000002

Then my Fish was so dry and the bruschetta which I expected to be great just tasted plain. I think the chef located in Foster city is much better.

777,Ashley M.,Eugene  OR,476,401,763.0,2012-07-08,4.0,I came into BJ's on a Thursday afternoon with my brother to grab some lunch. This place is huge! Many tables inside  a few outside  and even some in the mall where BJ's is attached. The staff greeted us kindly and we were seated immediately. The place was busy but not packed and soon I was sippin' on a watermelon mojito (one of their signature drinks). The mojito was alright  all I could really taste was the Watermelon Puckers they pour into it but I knew I was chancing it with something that was watermelon flavored in the first place. My brother works at a BJ's in Sonoma County so he knew what to order and what to not order. We had the potato skin appetizers and the California club flat bread. Both were tasty in an artery clogging sort of way. I had a few bites of each and man did I feel 10 pounds heavier. We packaged up most of it for the people back home and ordered our main course. The ahi tuna salad was giant and satisfying. I asked for no bell peppers and Voil! No red bell peppers!...(I swear every time I ask for that no one can handle it). When I saw the tiny drops of wasabi around my plate I thought I'd have to order more but I was wrong. The wasabi is SOOOOO SPICY! I can handle a good amount with my sushi at most authentic Japanese restaurants and eat more than the average person but this stuff was lethal. I liked it. My brother had the crispy chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. The potatoes are really cheesy but yummy none the less. We were stuffed but decided to share a mini Oreo Cookie Pazooki. It's a scoop of Oreo Cookie ice cream on a chocolate cookie with oreo cookie mousse on the side. It was the perfect small size for a few bites...unlike the table next to us ordering the 7 scoop  giant cookie party Pazooki! Damn! The music they play here is completely random so be prepared to hear quite the variety while enjoying your food. All in all this is a great restaurant for all ages and types of people. They have a large menu with tons to choose from drink and food wise. It's very similar to the cheesecake factory  minus the cheesecake.,2.68,2.81,2.936,2.512,2.758

1227,Maria C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,12,,2012-07-21,1.0,This restaurant has deteriorated in both quality of food and service. We ordered a deep dish pizza. It took over 45 mins to get out the order. Worse yet  the pizza was not hot but lukewarm  like it was some leftover I warmed up in my oven. Service was really bad too. It took no less than 3 times to ask for refills on our drinks. All in all  it took us well over 2 hours to finsh up because of the bad service. I have been to other BJs (in San Diego area) and they have not been this bad. This is easily one of the worst. I know I won't be going to this one again!,2.72,2.83,2.944,2.116,2.7860000000000005
1155,Elsa C.,San Francisco  CA,20,24,11.0,2012-07-24,1.0,"Probably the WORST customer service I had experienced ever...I had waited a while to write this review so it would give me time to cool off and put things in perspective. My friends and I came in to watch the last game of the NBA finals because I remembered while eating here how many big screens they had everywhere  and the boys needed to watch their basketball. So  I arrive and the place is already packed but with less than 10 ppl in the waiting area. I walk over to the hostess podium and wait patiently for the golden haired hostess who is finishing up something on the computer to ask to put my name down. I wait  and wait...and she doesn\'t acknowledge me so I think I better get her attention by saying ""excuse me?"" and she kind of holds her finger up at me and gives me a fake smile and says that she will be with me in a minute with a slight edge in her voice. That\'s fine  you\'re busy  I work at a restaurant...I get it.BUT then on the other side of the large podium a line starts forming and another hostess appears  and proceeds to take care of that line. She takes the name of one party  and then another  and the golden haired waitress pays no mind to anything that\'s going on. Seeing that two parties already had cut me in the line to put my name down  I ask the first hostess - ""umm  should I be asking HER to put my name down since you\'re busy?"" And..the golden haired hostess totally ignores me!I\'m pretty annoyed at this point  but I walk over to the other hostess  a dark haired girl  and I tell her I tried to out my name down with golden hair earlier but she blew me off. The dark haired hostess apologizes and gives me a pager  and takes my party of 7 down and tells me it\'s going to be about half an hour. I wait patiently again for my pager to go off. 45 minutes later  I go back up to the podium and ask what the deal is  and a third  african american hostess takes my pager and goes ""hmmm...i don\'t seem to have your reservation in our system."" REALLY? After all that you lose my freaking name? How else did I get a pager if you didn\'t take my name down? Not her fault  i know  but I glare back at the first two hostesses I encountered. The third hostess apologizes and tells me she will see what she can do. She is probably the only capable hostess out of the whole lot since the others were either rude or incompetent to not even take my name down when I already stated how bad I was treated.I arrived at 5:45 to put my name down. When we got seated...guess what time it was? 8 freaking thirty...almost 3 hours because those hostesses were so incapable of doing their jobs. It was just plain ridiculous. I would have left if the guys weren\'t so adamant about not missing the game. I am writing this to management of this establishment because I want them to know how poorly I was treated and how incompetent their hostess staff were. I never even got an apology from the first two  it was only the third hostess that looked really sorry and tried to help. Also  when we finally sat down my friend sat down to a plate with leftover food on it. When he asked for another  the waitress gave him a replacement with an equal amount of leftover food  not once  but twice! Gross. I will never EVER be coming back to this BJ\'s location again. Such a shame because I love their pizza and pizookies. I hope management cracks down and makes sure nothing like this happens to anyone ever again because I will say it again HANDS DOWN WORST HOSTESSES and CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.",2.68,2.81,2.94,2.116,2.758
1519,Riza I.,Pacifica  CA,0,11,,2012-07-26,3.0,I went to BJs yesterday for my brother's birthday. I thought the food was pretty good however  the wait was longer than what they had expected and I felt like we were waiting a long time to get our food as well as any refill we needed on drinks. To me  customer service is of big importance and I thought their customer service was just okay. I was also surprised to find out that we had to wait about 45 minutes for baby back ribs to be ready because they ran out. I'm just thinking if you know that there if that is one of your best selling dishes  you should be able to compensate for this. My brother had to change his order since he didn't want to wait but he should have just ordered the baby back ribs anyways since the wait for the rest of the food was about that long too.,2.64,2.82,2.94,2.38,2.748

I ordered a lunch size pasta dish and it was good enough for me to eat it all. I don't remember the name of it but it had angel hair pasta  sundried tomatoes  garlic and i think feta. It wasn't stellar because I really can't remember exactly what I ate.My friend also ordered a lunch pasta dish. Similar to mine.We also shared a mini pazookie. Regular cookie size but a warm freshly back chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream scoop - that was awesome!!

763,Juvy G.,Burlingame  CA,134,38,30.0,2012-08-07,2.0,"Visited on Saturday around 5pm. Normal dining. Got sat really quick  no wait. Server  Donia  was friendly. However  food took 45 minutes to arrive. Server kept saying the food would come out soon but it never did. She said she let the manager know already  but it seemed like the manager didn\'t do anything about it since it was 30 minutes ago since she told him and the food was still not out. I could have understood if the place was busy-- but it wasnt. Then when my food came out  it was incomplete. But she insisted that everything was there. But when i looked around-- the vegetables were missing. So i asked for the manager-- which took 15 minutes.When the manager  Spencer  came out  he said  ""So I understand your food took too long to come out? Just for future references-- it should not take more than 8-10 minutes for a steak salad."" He then apologized but just took my plate away. He made sure i didnt think the server forgot to ring in my food--but the way he said it made it seem like he was covering for her. OKAY SIR. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.. you and your staff should take note of that and you should have intervened ASAP once the server told you it was taking forever. And as a manager  you should have personally checked in with me... and explained instead of waiting for ME to ask for you. anyways--didnt feel like ordering anything else. lost my appetite. this place is only good if you want to get drinks at the bar and make use of their TV. other than that-- service sucks. food takes forever. Management clearly does not care if customers leave unhappy. They totally need to work on that.",2.6,2.83,2.936,2.216,2.7380000000000004
1020,Eugenia X.,San Francisco  CA,47,7,8.0,2012-08-09,3.0,Came here because of the pizookies and the lunch deals they have from 11-3pm Got here a little too late for that but definitely will come back next to try it. We got seated right away  our waiter came right after I think his name was David. We order fried calamari  stuff mushrooms  mini great white deep dish pizza  the thai mango salad  and one of the mocktails i think it was a peachberry. The food came kind of slow.. our appetizer (fried calamari) didn't come out first  came after everything was served. The mocktail was decorated with a salted rim like how a cocktail would. When I looked at it 3/4 of the glass was filled with ice  tasted watered down. I asked for another one with light ice  and more tea. He came back right away with a new one and it was much better. Fried calamari was a big hit for my boyfriend he loves that stuff  we're always looking for some good calamari. It comes with a ranch dipping sauce and a a lemon aolli. The deep dish pizza was pretty good  it had a lot of toppings on it they weren't being cheap! Thai salad didn't seem really authentic to me. Maybe it's because I know usually it's made with green papays  fish sauce  and soft shell crabs. Instead this was replaced witchili powdeh lettuce  some shredded mangoes  some bell peppers  some chili powder  some avacado  and deep fried wonton stripes. The stuffed mushrooms were my favorite. Small bites with bursts of flavors. After all of that we ordered the mini trio pizookie. White chocolate macadamia  red velvet  and oreo. When they came Ohmygod my boyfriend just grabbed the white chocolate one and NOMED IT ALL.. He was so amazed. They come with big scoops of vanilla ice cream. It works really well because the cookie is baked in a little deep dish  the pan is still hot and the ice cream just melts on the pizookie. It's heaven..The food is pretty good  I love the bar. They have so much choices. They also have happy hour only at the bar area. Our waiter was kind of mia and took some time to notice us. We caught him watching tv lol. Other than that I'm looking forward to visiting again.,2.64,2.85,2.936,2.38,2.766
1241,Frances L.,San Francisco  CA,0,3,,2012-08-15,3.0,"Definitely mixed reviews for this place. The wait time can be ridiculous depending on what time you go and also the day of the week  which is the main reason to why only 3 stars for BJ\'s. The call ahead ""no wait"" system they have only works if you have a party of 7  which most times we do not have that many. Even for a table of 2-4  it\'s about an hour wait! The food isn\'t bad and there are many options to choose from to conquer any craving. The pizookies are great too! Although this place is great  don\'t know if it\'s worth waiting hours for a table. I guess you can go shopping until the pager beeps.",2.64,2.84,2.936,2.316,2.7600000000000002
907,Khalif P.,El Cerrito  CA,0,13,,2012-08-16,4.0,BJ's is that place you visit when you wanna watch the game and drink beer while eating overpriced  but pretty decent food. I usually enjoy myself when I visit this location (up until the bill arrives ) The customer service is always top notch which is a huge factor in me making the trip all the way out here on Bart.The pizza is pretty darn good and the Jeremiah Red Beer will absolutely have you feeling right after your meal. Shout out to Vladimir(i think that was his name  Jeremiah Red people!) for his great customer service!4 stars,2.76,2.84,2.94,2.48,2.808

1131,Barbara M. M.,San Francisco  CA,1,109,5.0,2012-08-23,2.0,Meh. This place totally lacks the food presentation and the quality is just ok. My Thai salad was surprisingly very small ( although the plate where it's served is huge optical illusion ). The small 5 pieces of chicken in it where dried  very cold and chewy...not good. The dressing was lacking too and so the rest of the ingredients. My daughter Mac and cheese came in a huge big portion but the presentation was not appealing. You could tell that they didn't put any effort in mixing the Kraft cheese powdered with the macaroni. There were chunks of pasta attached together. Overall the kids menu' was a good value for money. The service here is great  too bad that the food presentation/ quality is lacking.,2.76,2.82,2.94,2.2800000000000002,2.796

982,Ladi Da A.,San Francisco  CA,651,485,194.0,2012-09-02,1.0,F*ck! STOP! DON'T EAT HERE!!!I hadn't been here in a while due to terrible service and ridiculously long wait times. It's been over a year. So  maybe things have changed? I decided to try the online pickup order. Pickup time...11:30am. Okay  so I call in at 11:00am to confirm my order's pickup time. Confirmed. Head over there. Arrive for pickup at around 11:35am. At 11:45am the guy working the pickup line is still on the first two customers he was helping when I walked through the door. The guy is obviously super flustered and cannot handle more than one thing at a time. I was there for 20 minutes  without ever being acknowledged! By 11:55am  I have sought out help from three other employees (host  waitstaff  etc.)  because if my food is ready...then it's getting f*ckin' cold!Finally  at around noon  they gather my three item order. Yes  a mere three simple meals. Yet  they completely forget the soup on one order. I didn't even bother to call after I noticed it missing  because I could not deal with any more frustration for the day. One of three items was a pizza  which was super wet and soggy at the bottom! Totally gross! What'd they do? Mop the floor with it?I spent over 30-minutes waiting for an 11:30am pickup order. If I had this much time to kill  I would have eaten at the restaurant!!! I nearly missed a meeting  waiting on this stupid order!I love BJ's  but I totally hate this location. The management and staff are completely unorganized and the staff do not know how to work under pressure. Yes  the kid working the pickup/express line was totally green  but if he sucked  it was obvious that he had no training and they do not have a system in place to organize their food orders. The kid working the express line needs training. He also needs backup! There were three hosts just standing around doing nothing  while this kid was freaking out running back and forth from the front to the back  and frazzled trying to take phone orders (difficulty multi-tasking). The hosts were just standing around with their thumbs in their ass. Two hosts are more than enough--there were 3 or 4!!! Put someone else at the busy pickup/express station! The cooks/chefs aren't getting orders out on time! Who the hell is making sure that food is being expedited out of the kitchen? The manager(s) were probably shopping at the mall  because no ONE was managing SH*T! People need training and the higher up(s) should get fired or go back to waiting tables  because things here are run chaotically and unprofessionally!!!If you like BJ's it's worth the trip down to their San Mateo location. The location in San Bruno at Tanforan completely sucks @ss.,2.8,2.82,2.936,2.052,2.812
1158,Max D.,San Jose  CA,24,20,7.0,2012-09-04,1.0,Worst BJS by far. I don't mind slow service if I get good or DECENT food. I ordered a rare New York strip and it came out medium to well done. They redid the steak and it came out rare  happy right? Wrong! The steak was cold and had terrible sear  for $20 I expect a decent steak Jesus. I tried to call on one of the waitresses but she literally looked at me then walked a way. Long story short  no tip and last time I'll ever be back. Other BJs are MUCH better.,2.64,2.77,2.92,2.2760000000000002,2.718
1157,Dan L.,San Francisco  CA,68,64,,2012-09-04,2.0,Have been to this restaurant several times before. We went this Tuesday evening - and hoped there wouldn't be a crowd. There wasn't but took about 10 minutes to get seated. I enjoyed their light lager beer - but food was hit and miss - daughter's pasta was bland - angel hair barely had any flavor (where were the sun dried tomatos and garlic). My thai mango salad was tasty but the portions were small. Plus service was real  real slow - about 1/2 hour wait plus 1/2 wait for the desert. Tons of people working there but they need to get their act together and get some quality in the kitchen.,2.64,2.78,2.924,2.2800000000000002,2.724

It makes me sad that the customer service is awful. I gave them many chances because I love the food but sadly the waiters and waitresses are disappointing. Most of the times ive been here the waiters/waitresses take to long. They rarely check to see how were doing and when i need something they are never around and take so much time just to get a bottle of ketchup!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1021,Chase L.,San Francisco  CA,96,111,22.0,2012-09-09,2.0,The food took at least 90 minutes. I'm not talking from the time we walked in... I'm talking from the time we order it. They weren't busy. It was 1130am on a Sunday. The food wasn't bad  but the wait made me lose my appetite. Our waitress was really nice.,2.6,2.79,2.92,2.3760000000000003,2.7140000000000004
1508,K Dizzle C.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,2012-09-09,1.0,"Second time here and had an even worse experience than before. Shame on me for thinking otherwise  I guess.We were sat down promptly  as it wasn\'t busy when we got there  but then our server disappears for 20 minutes. Finally  she comes around and gets our appetizers jotted down along with our pizza order. Then  a new waiter shows up and informs us that he would be taking over our table. Ok  that\'s fine  I think to myself  but then our pizza shows up before several of our appetizers and different waiters brought out each dish! So now we wait another 25 minutes before we see the second guy that helped us again and had to ask another waiter in the area to get him for us  and all he had to say was ""you ordered something else?"" We finally got our last appetizer after we had finished the others and the pizza  but of course it was already cold from sitting on a counter somewhere for too long. AND he forgot to refill our drinks after asking him TWICE.It wasn\'t even busy  but there was disoreintation amongst the staff that affected the quality of service to the point of a bad experience. As for the food  the pizza tastes exactly like Pizza Hut but with a premium price tag (no sauce  just cheap cheese and low grade meat on bland crust) and the mozzerella sticks leave a film in your mouth with a bad aftertaste. The beer is good though  I\'ll give them that.",2.6,2.77,2.908,2.308,2.702

1052,Andrew G.,Daly City  CA,86,29,5.0,2012-09-14,2.0,HOW ABOUT A NO. Not only does this place have the longest wait time in like all of California  but the service is pretty bad. This restaurant is a hell hole on Friday & Saturday nights! My friends & I  waited nearly 2 and a half hours one Friday night  just to be told that they are starting to clear up our table & should be seated within another 20-25 minutes. HOW WONDERFUL BITCHES. Once we are seated  our waiter seems to be within the last hour of her shift by never smiling & bringing our WATERS to us 20 minutes later. The food was pretty good  but not worth no hour of wait. IT WAS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS how one half of our party got their food 30 minutes before the other half. I mean like  c'mon people. To hell with this place! We drove up at 6pm  left the restaurant at 1045pm. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! Never again BJ's  never again.,2.56,2.77,2.912,2.44,2.686
745,Cheryl Q.,San Francisco  CA,78,210,209.0,2012-09-17,4.0,I used to come here frequently for birthday dinners  get-togethers  or just casual dinner/lunch. I haven't been here for about two years. A friend and I were studying across the way in the bookstore and decided to grab some lunch before leaving the mall. BJ's is just as how I remembered it! Good food  attentive staff  and clean. I ordered brunch-eggs with a bunch of veggies and avocados with wheat toast while my friend ordered his usual  the tilapia. Although I've been here plenty of times  I've never ordered anything from the brunch menu. My order was simple  satisfying  and delicious. We were eyeballing the bar as we were finishing our meals but had to make that flight to vegas!Make sure you order a pazookie (a freshly baked warm cookie topped with a large scoop of ice cream!

BJ's has CHANGED over the years  or maybe it's just this one at Tanforan:The BJ's Combination pizza just had a thin veneer of toppings on it. Just a few micro-pepperoni and some Italian sausage bits. Tomatoes. All bread  no substance. I was very disappointed.The good: We were seated quickly. The pizza arrived promptly  after we sent back the first pizza they brought us because it was the wrong one. The beer selection is huge  and the price for a pint draft is reasonable. Medium pizza and two beers: $40 for two including tip.,2.6,2.74,2.912,2.3440000000000003,2.684

The pot roast was pretty good minus the fact the vegetables were undercooked. The meat was tender. The sauce flavor filled. If they had only cooked the vege's in with the meat it would have been perfect. Instead it was sad. I had a cocktail with my meal. The black raspberry margarita.... It was an interesting flavor which could have used less squirts of the manufactured raspberry syrup. I would have preferred they made their own syrup actually. Yes my palette can tell the difference. Overall an ok experience. If in the area again I might come back.,2.64,2.74,2.912,2.476,2.7
878,Gibson J.,Daly City  CA,56,38,9.0,2012-10-07,1.0,Food service has taken a huge downfall. Instead of explaining my very long story I will say this briefly. Orders came in cold  the lettuce wrap was soggy. The wrap could of been on the hot plate for a while  who knows. We ordered our drinks but it came in a dirty glass. Who serves Remy in a dirty glass? I suppose this establishment. And if you ask them to switch glasses  they give you an excuse to order a new one. Why? You serve us a dirty glass you should give us a new glass  not make us pay for a new drink. Why do you switch waiters during a service  and having the second person covering not having a clue what we ordered? Apparently this place since they can't remember anything you ordered.they do now remember what you ordered  serving you cold food  and making you wait a very long food. And asking for a check... Really it takes 30 min for it?Well  with that rant out of the way... The food is either hit or miss... But the service... what happened? It is just awful. And yes  we got the manager involved and he comped a lot of our stuff. But it still doesn't excuse the fact the waitress wanted us to pay for a new Remy when it was served in a dirty glass. That is just inexcusable.,2.56,2.72,2.9,2.308,2.656

Our server arrived at our table at a reasonable time and asked for beverages  then about 5 minutes later he came back with our drinks. (The cream soda tastes amazing  by the way).He forgot to ring in our appetizer because I noticed that he didn't write anything down until he started taking our orders. No worries  we still wanted the calimari after our meals.Oh  and the kitchen had an extra pizookie so he gave it to us :D,2.6,2.72,2.904,2.7359999999999998,2.672
744,James D.,San Francisco  CA,64,43,3.0,2012-10-12,1.0,"I used to really enjoy going to BJs because they had decently priced food and drinks but sadly I gotta say they\'ve gone downhill in recent years. The food quality was never top notch to begin with (though that\'s kinda expected) but sanitation has become an increasing problem in my recent visits. I had ordered a mini pizza and as I began digging in I noticed an incredibly long hair baked into my pizza. I was offered a new pizza but I declined and the manager actually came to apologize. I didn\'t get anything complimentary but he removed the pizza from my bill so I didn\'t stress the issue.Fast forward to today and I am being served by someone who I\'m assuming is a nice lady but was either trained improperly or does not seem to understand how to read the menu. For starters we were told we weren\'t allowed to get a specific soup because it was neither a Wedneday or Saturday which apparently are the only days the soup is available. Upon looking at the menu it listed that the soup was ""Served Wednesday-Saturday"" and when we brought it up to the waitress she said that it was only for those two specific days listed. WHAT?!?!The last straw came with our bill. We ordered the lunch size pasta which comes with a soup or salad and is $1 off the regular price. My GF substituted the Shrimp for her meal bringing the regular price up about $1 and it was listed clearly that the total should be $13.95. Let\'s do simple math here: $13.95 - $1 because of the lunch special = what? If you said $12.95 you are wrong because it\'s actually $15+. When I addressed the error she took it to her supervisor and came back stating that I was wrong and even after pointing out the errors on their part she continued to insist they were right. Finally after some back and forth she came back with the ""corrected"" price of $13.05 and I realized that it would be a waste of time to wait for them to get the correct price of $12.95 so I paid the extra dime. I won\'t be coming back here for awhile and if you read this far  you may wanna stay away too. There are great servers here but the bad apples spoiled the bunch for me.Btw  even though our waitress (I won\'t say names) checked up on us maybe once every 15 mins  once I was supposed to sign the bill and leave a tip she decided to check up on me every 2 mins. Great prioritizing..",2.52,2.7,2.892,2.372,2.628
1219,Tahira R.,Millbrae  CA,0,10,,2012-10-13,5.0,Ver helpful employees  extremely cooperative and friendly staff. Once our order was mistakenly understood by one of the staff and they could not deliver it to us because it was not in their stock. Then the manager came and apologised in very humble way and evevn was so generous that he didn't charged us at all . He mentioned that it was their misundersytanding that they thought that order was available in stock. He was apologetic for wasting our time while we waited for the order. Anyways  it seldom happens everuwhere and that was a very nice gesture. Their vegitable pizza and desert platter is always our choice whenever we go to tanforan.,2.6,2.73,2.904,2.836,2.678

They were all ""ok"" - because we tried to get lower calorie foods. There are a ton of things on the menu. I love it when restaurants show the number of calories. The calamari is more than 900 calories!! It\'s a classic American restaurant - lots of high calorie food  but I\'m sure it\'s awesome! Next time I\'ll get some of the higher calorie foods. Service: They were super busy  even though we went on a weeknight and already 8pm or so. We had to wait 30 minutes.

364,Mike L.,San Francisco  CA,1130,1114,1709.0,2012-10-18,3.0,Generally speaking  I try to avoid chain restaurants if/when I can. It's not because I think their food is terrible (although it can be at a few places)  but rather a preference to go somewhere unique...and likely better. The two places I'd make the occasional exceptions for? Cheesecake Factory and BJ's (insert dirty joke here).While I generally don't expect much from chain restaurants  the food at BJ's isn't too shabby (Cheesecake Factory is better though). Granted  I've only tried a few things  but it' has been better than what little I've had from places like Chili's and TGI Friday's. While taking in a Giants game after work  my friend and I decided to split an order of the Artichoke Dip appetizer and the BJ's Favorite Pizza (oven baked meatballs  pepperoni  sausage  mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions  and roasted tomatoes).Compared to the Artichoke Dips I've tried at other chains  this one wasn't all that different (yelp.com/biz_photos/FMGN). The dip was a little salty and rich  but I can't complain with the amount of cheese they threw in  nor the amount of chips they gave us. As for their pizza  it's probably the best bet for something good (yelp.com/biz_photos/FMGN). The dough was a little fluffy  but not overly so  and I liked the mix of ingredients (it's essentially a combination topping pizza). Perhaps it was a little heavy on the tomatoes and salt  but no worse than some other pizza joints out there. Really  no complaints.With a solid beer selection (both outside and house brews) to go with their decent food menu  I certainly wouldn't be opposed to making future trips back to BJ's (especially since Gordon Biersch is gone). A beer  pizza  and a giant TV to watch whatever game is on? Sounds good to me (especially if my team wins). Too bad there always seems to be a long wait for a table though.,2.6,2.76,2.896,2.54,2.696

Rice was bland. Steamed veggies consisted mostly of steamed squash. It was bland and horrible. Almost not consumable. It came with a soup--I had the tomato bisque. His dish was not enough for him and he wanted to order more. Since i wasn't too thrilled with my order  he ended up eating the rest of my meal. Food took a looong time to come. Prices were abit high  especially for such poor quality food. I'd go to Jack's next time. Not only better food  bigger portions with lots of veggies.I've been here once before and i had the chicken salad but you can't really screw up on salad.,2.56,2.75,2.888,2.212,2.6740000000000004
517,Katie P.,San Francisco  CA,565,439,235.0,2012-11-21,1.0,You get what you'd expect at BJ's. If you're stuck in San Bruno  this is unfortunately one of the only places to grab food & beer. I think they hire people without any waiting experience  which would explain why their waitstaff is aloof and confused.The host ignored us. The table we were seated at had food and what appeared to be love stains all over the seats. I had to ask for cloth napkins to lay down because it was slightly terrifying. Our waitress was completely absent. Not once  but TWICE we placed drink orders from the General Manager (who was great  actually) because she was no where to be found. Everything is really overpriced for the quality of the food (which is poor). I don't even know why I'm writing this review. Duh  BJ's sucks. Hop on Bart and grab something fresh & local in SF if ya can.,2.48,2.73,2.88,2.244,2.63
814,Daniel D.,Concord  CA,825,461,309.0,2012-11-23,4.0,It's been a while but I've been here more than a few times...Recently discovered their soup in bread bowls... seriously you wouldn't think that some of the best bread bowls and soup are at BJ's. If you doubt me  give the tomatoe bisque or chili a try in a bread bowl. You will not be disappointed  especially during these winter days/nights.The take out is handled separately so you're not just in with the regular people dining. When I got some soup to-go  they included all the utensils and napkins that I needed. And it was just as good as when I had it at the actual restaurant.,2.44,2.73,2.888,2.6399999999999997,2.614
1045,Tyler L.,San Francisco  CA,99,82,2.0,2012-11-24,5.0,Just went to BJ's the other day for my first time and had a great experience! I was kind of surprised because I know it's a chain  but the food and service spoke for itself. I wasnt sure what to order so i asked our service  I think his name was Keith? and he suggested one of their pizzas. Since I already took his suggestion on what beer to have (which was AMAZING!)  i figured i would take him up on his second suggestion. GREAT CHOICE! Great beer  great pizza and great service....3 strikes and you win! Will come back again soon!,2.6,2.75,2.896,2.7399999999999998,2.6900000000000004
1061,Kari G.,San Mateo  CA,231,754,221.0,2012-11-30,4.0,This is my go to place for delicious pizookie. How could you not love a hot cookie covered in delicious ice cream? I seem to be biased towards their deep dish baking because my other favorite here is the pizza. It comes out in the oven dish piled high with all kinds of goodies. The sweet pig is the best! This BJ's recently added an outdoor patio. It has a big fire pit  plenty of warmers and glass windows around it so that you can stay nice and toasty even in the winter.,2.72,2.78,2.9,2.576,2.7560000000000002
767,Nellie N.,Daly City  CA,0,42,1.0,2012-12-04,2.0,"BJ\'s is always crowded  one would hope this is because of the quality food  unfortunately there must be other reasons  as the food is consistently disappointing and orders are routinely missing requested options such as ""dressing on the side"" resulting in a salad smothered in dressing.Pros --brewed beer-lots of HDTVs-location-options on the menuCons -- Woefully under-staffed take-out area-orders are incorrect 80% of the time (missing sauce  items  side orders etc..)-food is highly processed typical frozen/pre-made chain food-so many items on the menu  but only a few are half decent-management unable to provide direction to army of kids doing the work-cooks/food prep lack skill and direction.  Everything is microwaved/salty/fried-bagged / pre-chopped lettuce -long waits for take out or seating -potential gold mine location is mismanaged as some staff stand around with nothing to do while others are overwhelmed and backed up as orders sit and get coldFor a chain restaurant  BJ\'s would receive high marks. It\'s certainly much better than Applebees  or Olive Garden  they brew their own beer  and have a wide variety of items that are a bit more modern than the fare at Applebees.The main problem is many of the ingredients are clearly ""pre-prepped"" items. This is standard for many chain restaurants and unfortunately even local places take this short cut. For instance the salad uses chopped iceberg lettuce and pre-made boiled eggs.  I suspect the lettuce is cut and bagged  the reason I suspect this is because of how dry it often is and many times there is a lot of browning around the edges of the chopped area.The chicken fingers on top of the salad are clearly pre-cooked  frozen variety  Safeway frozen food section quality. Is it really that hard to use fresh chicken on a salad? Apparently this is a money/time saver.  It\'s very simple to make your own breaded chicken breast  it\'s borderline insulting to use frozen/pre-made and then sell it on a restaurant menu.Probably the best items I\'ve had from BJs are the ""small bites"" fried artichokes and chicken wontons.  While these also taste pre-made/frozen  it\'s the type of food that holds up ok to being processed. Dipping fried wontons in hot sauce and blue cheese is a classic experience that is difficult to mess up.But BJ\'s has managed to mess it up by routinely forgetting to include the blue cheese with to-go orders.The take-out section is woefully understaffed. Usually by 1 or 2 very young kid is tasked with handling the ever-ringing phone  walk in orders  and bagging and sorting it all.  Meanwhile a middle aged manager usually roams around pointing and making conversation with seated guests. At the hostess area  a group of young kids usually stands there aimlessly and making small talk with each other while the take-out area is 5 orders deep  and having difficulty arranging it all.You have to wonder if BJs management cares at all what anyone thinks. They are constantly crowded  and consider it\'s much better food than the nearby ""Hooters"" you have to assume that ""good enough"" is all they are concerned with.Truthfully  if you are in the Tan-Foran mall  what else are you going to do? Hooters  Food Court  Red Robin are your options.  All of them poor.",2.76,2.76,2.904,2.2800000000000002,2.76
533,Sonya S.,New Orleans  LA,30,147,91.0,2012-12-05,1.0,In fairness  the Beer should get 5 stars  but the food here was so bad  that this place deserves 1 star and they should be ashamed! I have eaten at Bj's in Orlando and Las Vegas and both times had really good food and beer  so we were both shocked that the food here was worse than Mc Donalds- and I HATE fast food! First  my partner ordered the Turkey Burger which came with fries. The fries came out stone cold. When we finally tracked someone down we told them and they eventually brought some more fries  which were also stone cold!! They were obviously from the same batch and had been sitting for some time. Really? Did they not think to check the temp as the issue was the fact that they were inedible cold  not that we wanted piles of fries! Burger was also tasteless  though the roll looked good.I had a Tomato and Mozzarella salad and a thin crust pizza. Pizza actually tasted remarkably like a Tonitos that you buy in the grocery store for .99  but I was paying $10.50. It was obviously frozen and I only ate 2 of the 6 pieces because it was gag worthy. Considering that on occasion I eat Little Cesears $5 Pizza Pizza  my standards are reasonable. After living in Florida for the past 5 1/2 years  I'm used to blah pizza  believe me! the fact that this was actually inedible really says something. The little salad was OK  though they put overwhelming seasonings on it which kind of ruined it. Just a drizzle of Olive Oil would have been fantastic.I was so annoyed about the food  I refused to get a 2nd beer because they do not deserve any more of my hard earned money! It's a shame because the Red Beer is really tasty.Also the service was horrible. trying to get the attention of a waiter was impossible. My partner joked about tossing his empty beer glass on the floor as they walked by to try and get the attention of someone-anyone! Ugh! Skip this place people  unless you just want beer. The food quality is really  really depressing! We stopped at the Wendy's on the way back to the room as neither of us ate much of our dinners and we were still hungry!,2.72,2.74,2.896,2.212,2.732
581,Judith L.,San Francisco  CA,298,140,311.0,2012-12-06,3.0,"BJ\'s is always a good place to go for a quick bite if you don\'t know what you\'re craving for. It has a wide variety to choose from and there\'s bound to be something that will catch your eye..or should I say your stomach? If you\'re looking for something small  I\'d say try the gourmet Mac n cheese. ""What makes it so gourmet?""""I don\'t know...the bacon? The bread on the side? The bread crumbs sprinkled on the top?""I don\'t know if that makes this Mac n cheese gourmet or not but it definitely makes a good snack. It\'s pretty cheesy and best eaten when it\'s hot  so remember not to leave it for last. I\'ve also had the ahi-tuna salad before. It was after the gym so I had to have something light or else...man  all that effort wasted. It was definitely a good choice. It was filling yet light. The tuna complimented the salad well. The chicken quesadillas were so-so. It\'s a cheap meal for lunch  but not satisfying. D had the Chicken Marsala once and he said the noodles were a bit hard.But definitely get the pizookie if you want dessert!! I get the red velvet one every time. Super delicious but not something you can finish by yourself (unless you have a super big sweet tooth).Long story short: The food can be a hit-or-miss but BJ\'s is just one of those places where you don\'t pay for amazing food or expect too much. The service is definitely forgettable though. Sometimes you have to ask five times just for a glass or water. Just don\'t have too high of an expectation and you\'ll be satisfied enough.",2.76,2.74,2.892,2.412,2.748

Well anyway  the food was nasty and I got stomach aches from it through out the night. Also  the restaurant was very dirty. It looked like they hadn't dusted in weeks!! It was just unsanitary!

Once i found an onion in it. It also came with crunchy garlic cheesy bread sticks that this time was a soft plain slice of bread. I also waited 10 minuets for a scoop of ice cream.

I ordered a Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and it was totally not worth it  it was $14 without tax. The fettuccini was pretty mediocre  no wow factor present at all. I wonder if it's because I've order the wrong dish and if there were other better dishes here?

826,Phill E.,San Francisco  CA,4,64,11.0,2013-01-12,2.0,This place has sadly declined in quality. Tonight was the first time in several months that i had visited  and decided to order take-out for the family. We had the Mediterranean pizza  1 order of the wings  kids spaghetti with marinara sauce and kids chicken tenders. As soon as we arrived (~15 min after calling in) we were greeted by the take-out cashier  we paid for our food and went on our way.Opening the pizza box  to my dismay  was a pizza that looked very different than the ones I had ordered from there before. Quality was lacking; toppings were clumped together or spread unevenly  the edges had no form and lacked the crispiness they once had  and the pizza was barely cut. The actual key ingredients such as the chicken  were almost nowhere to be found!!! We ordered a large pizza and i could fit all of the chicken into the palm of my hand....The wings had gotten worse as well  they tasted less like chicken and more like the fryer oil they are to be cooked in. Kids meals....barely any sauce  garlic bread was hard but thank God for kids who aren't picky with their food. The kids chicken tenders were alright.Not sure if i'll return for the food if this is their new level of quality but i will return during happy hour for drinks!,2.64,2.67,2.852,2.472,2.6580000000000004

We waited for 30 minutes or so for them. The waiter brought 2 chocolate chips out but not the raspberry. He told us that it would take a few more minutes...we waited another 15 minutes until the waiter came by and told us the cookers messed up on the raspberry order and asked if i wanted to wait or remove that order from our check. I asked how long more would I wait for the raspberry pizookie and he said 10 minutes. I told him forget it and just remove it from my check...but then  I waited for more then 5 minutes for my check (I could of just waited for the damn pizookie).

OMG LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE AVOCADO EGG ROLLS ARE AWESOME. I love the dipping sauce that it comes with! Honestly  what takes away the stars is always the service. I just feel like for the amount of people I see working there  it shouldn't take as long as it does to get the food and even just water. When you have to ASK for your water instead of your waiter/waitress asking you what you'd like to drink -- that's already a minus for me  baby.

This place does NOT have the best service for starters. Their drinks are expensive and nOT great.. Okay  here goes the bIG one- I have some teenagers from my work who went out to eat here. They ordered non alcoholic drinks seeing how they are NOT of age to drink and had no desire to do so. The server brought them alcoholic beverages which they were not aware until they took a sip of the drinks. This is unexceptable.

However this time around was ridiculous and not what I expect from a pretty known restaurant. I went with a group of people for a birthday and it all started when they tried seating us at a booth that didn\'t have enough seating for the whole group. Not only did the time we finally sat down  take our order and receive our food last nearly an hour  they lost someone\'s order. A burger to be exact which he wanted well done. Apologies were given and they said ""the burger was overcooked"" and they\'ll bring another  stat. When it did arrive  boom. Medium rare. Really  I don\'t ever remember food ever being wrong  or burnt like my friends bruschetta  or a pizookie taking 20 minutes to make. Sorry to say but it was less than amusing.",2.68,2.67,2.824,2.348,2.6740000000000004

I guess it was breakfast time so I got a breakfast pizza. I had one slice but polished off the potatoes  YUM!Washed it down with a bloody mary.

848,Katie W.,San Francisco  CA,47,14,,2013-02-16,2.0,"Bj\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse used to be a lot better; however  in the last few months  it seems they have dropped the ball in the service department.First off  I do love the actual facility as far as set-up  decor  and atmosphere. It always seems to be packed with patrons and the hosts at the front are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately  the service here has gotten pretty crappy lately. My go to items to order are the California Club pizza & the Red Velvet Pazzokie. Both are usually great. My fianc and I have eaten there/ordered food from there maybe 4 times in the last 3 months. The last time I ordered the California club pizza there was extra flour caked onto the bottom of my pizza  it was gross. Service was alright. 3rd to last time we were in there was the worst. We dinned in at the Brewhouse this night. It took 5 minutes for us to even be greeted by our server  who then disappeared for an additional 5 minutes without even taking our drink order. After sitting there for 15+ minutes  we finally ordered drinks. My fianc ordered a steak and I ordered shrimp kabobs and a lobster tail. When our food arrived  mine was cold. Now I\'ve been a server at numerous restaurants and I know how tough the job is  and it takes a lot for me to actually complain about something. This is the first time I have ever actually had to ask the waitress to take my food back to be warmed up. My fianc was nearly finished with his food before I got to begin eating mine. Thats just not acceptable when you\'re spending $80+ on a dinner at BJ\'s (which is a lot for this place). We clearly weren\'t a priority on this night.2nd to last time  was mid december of 2012. We ordered the curbside take-out for the first time. It was simple enough to order online and the wait time wasn\'t too long. We ordered a personal pizza  the meatball app.  and the gormet Mac n\' cheese. I was very disappointed with the mac n\' cheese. The bacon in the mac n\' cheese was burnt to a black crisp. It tasted disgusting! The worst part  is that someone clearly didn\'t care that they were putting charcoal into my dinner... I tried to pick out as much of the bacon as I could and tried to eat around it.The last time we ordered food was Feb. 14th  2013. We ordered the curbside take out again online. We ordered about $45+ of food  including one of their baked potatoes. When my fianc went to pick up the food about 40 minutes later  he arrived to find out they had no potatoes left. They had made the rest of the food; however  never called to inform us that we needed to choose a substitute  so I didn\'t get dinner. My dinner ended up being the pizookie  they gave us for free (which we had already ordered) to make up for it. There is no excuse for not calling to get a substitute choice  for 40 minutes! Seems as though this place may have a high turn-over rate of servers. Whatever the problem is  I\'m to the point where I\'m simply going to go over to Jack\'s for dinner. They have never gotten our orders wrong  left us sitting at the table with no greeting  and the food is always great & also affordable! BJ\'s needs to step up their game  they are displaying a message of ""We are trying to accomodate for more patrons than we can handle  so some may suffer."" Not worth it to me.",2.68,2.7,2.824,1.9600000000000002,2.692
1163,John P.,Millbrae  CA,0,2,,2013-02-19,3.0,Service was horrendous. My group of more than 20 had a reservation and suddenly  at the night of our dinner  our reservation was gone-- perhaps because we all looked young and they did really not cater our needs.Service was rude  food took WAY TOO LONG  and the only good thing was the pizooki.,2.64,2.69,2.824,2.0600000000000005,2.67
793,Tiffany H.,Davis  CA,146,76,20.0,2013-02-20,4.0,BJs is the restaurant of choice whenever we plan a group dinner. Not for their food  but for their atmosphere and large tables. This is the place to be if you want to go out to watch a game. The food is good  but not superb. I'm a plain Jane and always order the same thing every time-- their spaghetti with marinara sauce. That and their minestrone soup when available. We don't go there for good food we go for their atmosphere. Waiters here are also very nice and accommodating.The wait here is usually an hour  so remember to call in and reserve a table!,2.72,2.69,2.828,2.2239999999999998,2.702
792,jennifer f.,San Francisco  CA,192,46,2.0,2013-02-23,4.0,BJ's is always a hit or miss.but as always  you don't come to a place with 20 big screen tvs for fancy service or good food... you come for the 20 big screen tvs. This is a great place to watch a game (baseball season is coming up!). especially if you're rooting for the local team  guaranteed the whole restaurant will root with you. (my personal experience from going to BJ's during the giant's 2012 world series games) Makes for a fun time  guaranteed.Besides the tvs  their variety of beer is always a must try. i've done the sampler twice and now i know i hate dark beer. Their berry cider is a must try for newbies (really sweet  tastes like soda).Another thing that is unique to BJ's is definitely their pizookie. who would've thought? a giant cookie topped with ice cream to share.. genius!,2.8,2.71,2.824,2.16,2.7459999999999996
493,Aileen C.,Cupertino  CA,242,97,337.0,2013-02-28,4.0,Great food and great company!!This was my first visit at the BJ's in San Bruno  and I have to say that the food was better than my expectation. I have been to the BJ's in Cupertino a handful of times and each time I went  my expectations were lowered. I came here with a party of eleven (three children) for lunch on a Sunday. When I first came in  I went straight to the hostess to ask for a table; she told me that it would be 30min to 1hr. She never mentioned that we could sit outside  which would be immediate seating  until the rest of the party came in. -______-If you sit outside  it does get a little noisy  as the airplanes land. As a group  we shared various appetizers. We had the buffalo  orange chicken wings and boneless wings  and potato wedges. The potato wedges were BOMB!! very crispy  right amounts of cheese  bacon  and green onion. I think the best thing I ate that afternoon. I also shared the Cajun chicken with my cousin.  When the plate came out  the food was very hot  which I LOVE! I had imagined it to taste some what like jambalaya  but it just tasted like grilled chicken :( I also had a rib  which was DELICIOUS! :),2.84,2.72,2.836,2.096,2.7680000000000002
823,Peta B.,Walnut Creek  CA,15,34,2.0,2013-03-02,2.0,Within minutes of being here  it became clear that this is the type of place that does not think much of it's clientele  so the staff doesn't feel the need to try very hard. We ended up in the area and needed to grab a casual dinner. We figured  you can't go wrong with a BJ's. Well  we learned that you can.We got drinks at the bar while we waited for a table. The bartender made 4 pomegranate martinis and topped them off with a clear liquid when they came up short. I assumed the clear liquid was tequila but it turned out to be extra syrup. The drinks were unbearably sweet and a complete disaster. The service didn't get any better from there. The food was mostly ok.Skip this one. We've all experienced better!,2.76,2.73,2.832,1.864,2.742

721,Dave S.,Sunnyvale  CA,1,124,4.0,2013-03-14,2.0,We stopped by here last Sunday for a quick lunch on our way up to the city  and were not impressed. We all decided on different versions of the pizza and salad combo  and while they were tasty  there were only about 9 bites worth of pizza (and those would have been small bites). The prices seemed really high for such small servings  but I guess they do have to pay their massive staff. I didn't count them  but it seemed like they had waaayyyy too many people waiting on the customers (the place was only about 20% full). The staff was attentive- too attentive- they kept asking if we wanted drink refills  even when the glasses weren't even half empty.One last note to the wait staff- if you want to tell your co-workers about the itchy red blotches and pimples on your legs  please do it somewhere besides the dining room...  Yeah  we heard the whole story!I won't be going back.,2.84,2.73,2.824,1.768,2.774
1149,C K.,Alameda  CA,1,10,,2013-03-15,1.0,"This place used to be ok. Maybe better than that. But we went by for a quick meal on March 11th about 4:00 PM and the place was a mess.We were served in the bar (the greeter said there were no tables for three but we could see them empty) . Our waiter seemed to be the only one there and was running ragged. It also seemed to be end of shift . The manager should know better than to run a place like that.We ordered simple food. Chili for my wife and pizza for me. How could it be easier. Just get chili from a pot.I got my pizza after a while and luckily shared with my wife. Three quarters of an hour and several ""I am sorry"" stories from William M  we cancelled the pizza. No explanation. No nothing.Drinks were late too.I am not sure what was going on but do not go there execpt if you want to drink. And sit at the bar where you can grab the bartender. Food service was impossible. They need waiters and cooks--this is a big place.And then there were the bathrooms. They needed to issue wading boots to get to the urinals. The dirty paper towels were piled about a three feet high near the sink. And my wife said the womens was a mess too.So I do not know what happened to my old standby for quick food. But I gotta kiss you off after this. And I cannot put zero stars--I tried.",2.8,2.71,2.816,1.6680000000000001,2.7459999999999996
700,Jason S.,South San Francisco  CA,54,79,18.0,2013-03-17,2.0,Wa-womp- I went here with some work friends. even though we mentioned to our server that we had a movie to catch in 1hr  the pizza I ordered didn't get to me until 45 min after I ordered. After we paid the bill. The lesson here is to not go to BJ's if you are in a rush. Which is a shame since it is so close to sfo and is walking distance to a movie theatre.It wasn't a total loss. The server let us have happy hour prices for beer and mini pizzas (aka the one I didn't get until after we paid) even though we were there at 11am and the happy hour menu clearly stated the first wave for discounts was at 3pm. Plus the guy was nice. By the way the server apologized for the pizza coming in late. The reason was because my mini pizza went to another table somehow and they had to cook (reheat?? idk!) a new one in the kitchen for me...In any case I may find myself coming here more anyway since we do a lot of shift dinners from here and I'm a sucker for their pizzas no matter how crap the punctuality and prioritization of the general service is.,2.72,2.69,2.812,1.768,2.702

765,Ben T.,San Francisco  CA,374,185,14.0,2013-04-12,1.0,What can you actually like about this place? I had a friend reserve a table for 20 for her 21st birthday at 9:30. That seems like a pretty decent hour to seat a table of 20  right? Most people would clear out  you can set it up in the back  try not to double stack tables  and we're all good  right?How did they manage to make us wait over an hour and half for the table? Despite my pleas and begs to refuse our business to this place  we ended up staying anyway.The bar barely stocks call liquor. The food is a mediocre greasy mess. Our waiter was trying his best  besides being fairly inept at taking a large group. Even an avocado egg roll didn't cheer me up after this fiasco.,2.64,2.67,2.796,1.6680000000000001,2.6580000000000004
1066,Melissa G.,Chicago  IL,27,23,,2013-04-19,1.0,My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night  place was pretty busy but didn't seem too chaotic.We asked how long the wait was and the host told us about 15-20 minutes  she gave us a pager and told us we could walk around the mall but not too far. After 45 minutes we asked the host what was up and how much longer she thought it might be. She seemed a little flustered and said soon. I noticed some people just walking in and sitting at tables near the bar so I asked if we could sit up there and she said yeah all that is open seating  would have been great to know that to begin with but accidents happen and she probably just forgot to remind us or maybe thought we had been there before.The food was okay but some of it was definitely frozen and not fresh or made in house. They have a ton of beers on tap which were all pretty good. Service was okay  server didn't really check back on us  which kind of ruined it for me because I ordered fettuccini alfredo and it had been sitting in the window for a while because the plate was super hot when it was delivered and the all the sauce had dried up and the pasta was stuck together. We were almost done and the server came to ask if we wanted any desserts but I asked if he could bring me a side of alfredo so I could finish my dinner. He did and apologized for the way it came out but we never saw a manager nor did one come to our table. Next time I will probably only go to have beers & appetizers on their patio.,2.64,2.66,2.788,1.7640000000000002,2.652

669,Nobu K.,San Francisco  CA,1537,966,45.0,2013-04-23,2.0,Jim Bean Bourbon Burger  at Carl's Jr. 6 bucks.That's the most great deceptive advertising burger ever as we all know.It just doesn't look like the TV ad  at all.I think Carl's Jr. always does that deceptive TV advertising using fashion model to fool guys around. A guy like myself. I am a fool.I really wanted to get the Bourbon Burger  at Carl's Jr. And I did the other day.It was a creepy bad disgusting burger ever had.I believe it was soy-sause mixed w/ high fructose corn syrup plus msg for kick  and calling Bourbon Burger.False Advertising.But  if  you are having a burger is not better than that  that'll be a problem.I had a bacon Cheese burger at BJ's. I was with my friends. My friends like BJ's. I think because those TVs on the wall. I have been avoiding coming here so many times with them but I could not say No to this time.I just did not like the hamburger  OK?The burger patty was dry  not moist at all. It was cold  I hate eating cold burger. I am very sure that my burger was sitting in the kitchen for a while because the place is really big. That is very hard for all wait-staff. We were sitting near by the kitchen so I have heard the commotions from the kitchen and waiters hit the door very hard and came out.That's not good sign seeing and making a bit curious possibly a fight between kitchen staff and waiter  no matter what.All kitchen-staff in any restaurants in California are basically own by Mexicans  right?It's pretty rough in there if you don't speak Spanish. They will tear you down. They'll talk bad behind you back.We all do  don't we? California kitchens are all rough world.But  they should keep their problem more quietly in the kitchen. I felt bad for the waitstaff because our waitress was good.They must have a bigass kitchen  many people working really hard  but a big restaurant like this  I don not know how to manage people  how to control orders and who gets 1st  and what not. So  I do feel sorry giving the place 2 star. But  Hey  my hamburger was not that good. Bourbon Burger at Carl's jr.is better.So  I still try to avoid the place.I hate my friends  sometimes.,2.56,2.65,2.78,1.9280000000000002,2.614

1114,Larry K.,San Francisco  CA,9,23,,2013-04-30,4.0,Got to admit I'm a little blown away by the quantity of bad reviews here. While the service is spotty and sometimes it's a long wait to be seated because the place is often packed (how bad can it be if it is almost always packed?)  their menu is HUGE  and I've never ate a bad meal. So it's not the greatest restaurant in the world  but I never found the place dirty as some have mentioned  and I've never gotten sick as others have mentioned. I must have ate here a dozen times  and will certainly return next time I head to the mall.,2.56,2.66,2.784,2.352,2.62
1518,Duelcitizen B.,San Francisco  CA,4,3,,2013-05-07,1.0,I NEVER REALLY WRITE REVIEWS UNLESS IT'S NEEDED... I am very disappointed in this location! I was out celebrating with a friend yesterday May 6 around 6pm. I ordered an drink with alcohol and my waiter said he needed to take my driver's license to his manager to double check it because it's an out of state license. He brings my drivers license back to me bent completely in half! I ask him what happened and he said he didn't know the process but  that's how the manager checks the driver's licenses. He bends them in half. I am from out of state in school here. I will not be back home until this semester ends! What if he broke it. It would not be easy to acquire a new one being here in California. This business needs a machine or another way. I got no apology and I was treated as if it was nothing and no thought. I am very displeased about this service. I will take my complaint up the chain of command. Now I have a bent up card that will now not last nearly as long as it should.,2.48,2.62,2.772,2.02,2.564
954,Maggie M.,San Francisco  CA,204,72,3.0,2013-05-09,2.0,I normally love BJ's. However  my experience tonight has changed my opinion in BJ's for a while. For the first time  I ordered BJ's favorite deep dish pizza. This was supposed to come with three meats  Italian sausage  meatballs and pepperoni along with some veggies. What came out was not what I ordered. For one  the crust was soggy. Two  pizza was cold. And lastly  THERE WAS NO MEAT ON MY PIZZA. I was too engrossed with conversation with my friends to realize this so I had about 3/4 of it before I realized it had no meat. I told the server about this and he said ge probably mixed up the pizza and offered to bring me another one but since I had already eaten most of it  I felt that there was no point in getting a second one. I was already completely full. Now  I'm really not one to complain about a whole lot  but I felt that there could have been something else done to fix the situation. My friends kept telling me to ask him to comp the meal but I felt that would have been kind of shady. Oh well.,2.4,2.63,2.768,2.12,2.5380000000000003

I order a Mojito and a california club pizza with NO AVOCADO! my girlfriend got the Santa Fe Salad with prawns. Our drink was deliver fast and our food came at the right time about 15 minutes  only one problem  my pizza had avocado. I sent it back and they told me they make me a new one. I think our server realized he had made a mistake so he ignored us for 30 minutes. Our waters were empty and i wanted another drink but the server would just walk by and nothing. After about 30 minutes the manager walked out so i flagged him down and explained our situation  he said he would go check on it. Then finally our server came and i told him what happened  i order another drink and told him to make another salad for my girlfriend as the lettuce was all soggy from the sun. The manager brought me my pizza and it looked good  then i told him i had a drink so he had to go get it as the server didn't go get it. Then i look at my pizza and it looks like they had just wiped off the avocado as i can still see little marks of it  i had not eat 2 pieces. Finally we ate what we could and asked for our bill.The manager was remarkable but the server was awful  and the food time also bad considering it was only a pizza.

Deep dish pizza - nothing baked into the pizza. Not a deep dish  just a very fluffy  doughy pizza with the toppings on top. Nachos - almost nonexistent cheese and minimal pico de gallo. Potato skins - again  almost nonexistent layer of cheese. Cobb salads - under-dressed pieces of small iceberg lettuce with soggy croutons. Mozzarella salad - one piece of lettuce. Now  the pizookies were good  but you can't go wrong with ice cream on top of a fresh cookie. I recommend the cookies and cream kind. Otherwise  find somewhere to eat that won't cost you this much money for such poor food.,2.28,2.61,2.752,2.184,2.4779999999999998
1704,Ryan F.,San Francisco  CA,3,26,4.0,2013-05-18,1.0,me my mom and my two aunties went there yesterday around 3pm. from the host down to the table and server was so nice... food is great... but the server is not honest.... after we order pizza bj's favorite  2 pasta the chicken alfredo and scampi pasta  beers  soda and tea. my mom paid everything in cash about $90 something and we saw that... the server even opened the check book. then my mom decided to order again in a different check  2 beers and one spicy wings w/c cost only 16 dollars including tax. after that they charge my mom $105 something.... and we called the manager in regards of the issue being double charge w/c we already paid off the first check w/c about 90 something... the manager talked to the server and the server denied that we did not pay him for our first check. i told the manager if he can review the camera coz the server is lying... as a resolved the manager gave us a gift card... and the manager apologies but the server did not even showed up and talk to us in regards of the issue... the server is a liar! that makes the restaurant bad... and i will not go back to that restaurant anymore... instead of giving us the money back for the first charge since they charge us double... they gave us a gift card! what a stupid idea! the server already took the money and bj;s will give us a gift card? its not right! i dont even want to accept the gift card! but since thatbi dont wanna argue in regards of money we let it go!....,2.2,2.6,2.736,2.116,2.4400000000000004
993,Caryn B.,Campbell  CA,23,153,6.0,2013-05-20,2.0,Bland white people food. Overpriced entrees. Stupidly large menu. Need I say more?,2.2,2.59,2.732,2.248,2.434
1425,P L.,San Bruno  CA,0,28,,2013-05-22,5.0,This BJ's is great! The staff always remembers me and knows what I like to get. This is not common to find in big-name chains such as BJ's. Well done! I love to come in for lunch and get the endless soup and salad combo. The tomato mozzarella is so delicious and such a good deal!,2.28,2.59,2.736,2.612,2.466
742,Andrew K.,San Francisco  CA,1903,4446,,2013-05-23,2.0,Chain reminiscent of the chains from my childhood. Clean space  nice waiter  long Cheesecake Factory-type menu. Very cheap - especially for lunch - they can't be using good ingredients. Made a few substitutions on my salad and kitchen was so confused that they took an extra 45 minutes for my food to come out. Food tasted so-so.,2.2,2.59,2.732,2.248,2.434
1390,Shay G.,San Mateo  CA,1,14,,2013-05-25,2.0,So this is my favorite chain  but this location doesn't represent it well. The fries are either super greasy or taste like they've fried fish in the same oil as the French fries  the service is slow (good luck getting your drink refilled quickly...they have a drink station that a specific person does refills for. The wait is ridiculous and the quality of the food/preparation isn't like the BJ's in san mateo. San Mateo's is MUCH better on ALL levels. Sad to say  but its true. I've been to both more than 50 times.,2.12,2.58,2.724,2.248,2.396
1018,Karina A.,San Francisco  CA,21,205,37.0,2013-05-31,3.0,Decent happy hour drinks and snacks. But sometimes the drinks do taste a little watered down. I always asked for light ice!,2.08,2.58,2.72,2.412,2.38
1613,Jessica B.,Millbrae  CA,0,14,,2013-06-01,1.0,My party of three (myself  my husband and my 7 year old son) arrived at the restaurant around 5pm. It wasn't too packed as the wait was only 10 minutes. When we were seated we noticed many many open tables and booths yet they had a few people waiting up front. Once they sat us down they sat us in the back right in between two other tables. We moved to a booth and things seemed better until I opened the napkin to retrieve my silverware. All the utensils were spotted and my fork had residual red lipstick smeared on it and I opened all six napkins that were on the table. Then we ordered our dinners. I ordered the baked potato. 45 minutes after taking our order the waiter brings my son and my husband's food and asks me if the manager has spoken with me. No one had. Apparently they ran out of potatoes. I was offered soup or salad after the fact. I declined and still no one came to talk with me. I watched my family eat and our waiter was nowhere to be found. I guess he didn't want to deal with us anymore because of the dinner issue. We had to flag him down to get our check because we wanted to get the heck outta there. Needless to say it was a horrible experience. On my way out I informed the manager of the issues and she told me she would look into it although she didn't ask me for any information so I think it is highly unlikely that she did. There was no service recovery attempted and I'll be damned if I ever eat there again. So not impressed.,2.04,2.55,2.708,2.148,2.346
1419,Alicia H.,Daly City  CA,0,1,,2013-06-06,1.0,My son (11yr old) and I walked into BJ's San Bruno today at 1055 am. We were seated a minute later. They had just opened. You would think service and food will come out pretty quickly. Think again. Server Alex took our order 5 minutes later. I ordered unlimited soup and salad  and my son ordered kids meal (ribs). Our food came out 25 minutes later. My soup was warm but I didn't complain. Half way thru my soup  server Alex asked how everything was. I said good  but can I have another bowl of soup (knowing it would probably take a long time to get another one). Soup came out 15 mins later (really ?). There was a couple sitting near us who had complained about there wings not having enough sauce. Alex took it back and it came back with more sauce in less than 2 minutes. Why did they get better service  maybe because their bill would probably be more  meaning more tip for him ??? I have done this job before and yes  unfortunately it does happen like that. The bigger the bill the better your tip will be. Someone else brought the soup. I made the comment about how long it took then asked her if I can have my soup to go. She said yes I can get that for you  but never came back. I sat there for another 5 minutes waiting for Alex to come to my table. He never came back. So I finally waved down a manager  William  I told him all that had happened. He apologized and said he will minus my meal for the inconvenience. I did also tell him that Alex never came back to face me to apologize for anything. That is so freaking frustrating to be ignored when its their job to give you good customer service no matter what you order. This BJ's Restaurant in San Bruno has gone down in service. They have hired people who do not care so why should the paying customers care to come back ???? I even gave him a tip !!! Why did I do that ??? I guess because my son did enjoy his meal. If you decide to come to this BJ's  lets hope you don't get Alex or anyone like him as a server. No personality. This was not my first incident and it wasn't my 2nd. I just thought I give it another shot. Never again !!! I have never yelped before. Like another yelper stated....BJ's was asking for it.,1.96,2.53,2.696,2.244,2.302
1033,Ashley G.,San Diego  CA,51,31,63.0,2013-06-09,2.0,I've been to many BJ's in the past but this one was one of the worst. It was extremely crowded on a Sunday and the service was very slow. Our waiter left all our plates at the table and rarely cleared it. My advice would be to not come at a regular dining hour.,1.96,2.53,2.692,2.3760000000000003,2.302
707,Catheria S.,San Francisco  CA,240,65,8.0,2013-06-11,1.0,Came here for my birthday to get the free pizookie (no shame).We sat in the bar for the happy hour menu. The drinks took 10 minutes to arrive and the HH food (such small portions they may as well be appetizers) took 45 minutes to reach our table.Oh  and the angus sliders plate looked cluttered with random scraps of lettuce falling off the edge of the plate.Not to mention another 20 minutes for the check.Lunch ended up being 2 hours long. Luckily for Steven the server  it was my birthday so I wasn't in a complaining mood.,1.96,2.5,2.692,2.244,2.284
909,Anu P.,Philadelphia  PA,479,345,182.0,2013-06-15,3.0,A very typical BJ's experience: poor service  yummy appetizers and drinks. Service: My friend and I got seated pretty quickly on a Friday evening around 5:45pm. However after being seated  our waitress didn't come for about 10 minutes. When she finally did  we ordered our drinks and appetizers all at once. After that  it took her another 10 minutes to bring us water! So much waiting just for water. Our drinks came out quickly after and so did our appetizers. Again  after we finished eating  our waitress basically disappeared because she didn't come to check in on us (I wanted red pepper flakes for my pizza) and she didn't come back until about 15 minutes after we finished eating. I kept seeing her serve the high stool tables  possibly because they were for bigger parties (thus bigger bills and tips  as suggested by other yelpers). She kept refilling drinks and coming back for things they needed  but it took me forever to flag her down to finally get our bill. This is not unusual though--BJ's typically has very poor service because there are always SO many people around and each server has to take care of one too many tables. However  since it was happy hour and Friday evening  I understand why the delays were a little longer. Drinks: The slow service didn't take away from the amazing drinks and food though! I ordered the Arnold Stronger  which as basically an arnold palmer with simple syrup and Kettle One Vodka. It came out stronger than I expected but after squeezing in some lemon juice  it tasted amazing. Refreshing  flavorful  and something new. My friend ordered the pear cider which he enjoyed as well. It was a half cider half beer type drink so it wasn't too sweet but still tasted much better than plain beer! Food: We ordered two appetizers: avocado egg rolls and goat cheese flatbread. The avocado egg rolls are a favorite of mine and never disappoint. They are rolls of thin bread fried with avocado  cream cheese  some sort of chipotle sauce  and tomatoes. They come with some sweet sauce  but you really don't need it. The avocado rolls hit the spot everytime and I couldn't resist from eating most of the plate while sipping on my drink. Perfection! The goat cheese flatbread was tasty as well. It was a thin bread with goat cheese  zucchinis  mushrooms  tomatoes  and light pesto. The slices were light and flavorful. Only thing i didn't enjoy was how much goat cheese was on some of the slices  but if you like goat cheese  you would love this flat bread! The pesto was also a good consistency because it wasn't runny and oily on the flatbread either. Verdict: Despite service issues  I always love coming to BJ's because their drinks and appetizers never disappoint me! I want to come back for the stuffed mushrooms...already dreaming of them!,2.0,2.5,2.692,2.444,2.3
1083,Rebecca N.,San Francisco  CA,3,37,1.0,2013-06-16,1.0,"Five things about this place: 1. One time  I ordered a salad and I FOUND A HAIR IN IT! I didn\'t even get to eat it. Lost my appetite by the time they ""remade"" my order. It was poorly plated the first time around and even uglier the second time around. It seemed as if they removed the hair and added more dressing to the plate since my lettuce was soggy. 2. Service is terrible unless the place is empty. If it\'s a busy day  don\'t expect your food to come quickly. You\'ll be waiting forever. 3. The servers love to socialize...with other servers. 4. The servers are too scripted. It\'s scary. 5.Every time I\'ve come here  my food has been lukewarm. Terrible. I can\'t even...",1.92,2.46,2.68,2.18,2.2439999999999998
799,Michelle H.,San Francisco  CA,33,13,3.0,2013-06-16,2.0,"This place feels beyond generic. We went on a Friday night and sat in a booth in the bar area. The service was incredibly slow - I understand Friday nights are busy.. but it took ages to get our drinks and almost 45 minutes for our food (half of which was forgotten by our waiter and brought out 10+ minutes after everyone else\'s food had arrived). The food was average at best - while the food prices weren\'t bad  nothing on the plate stood out and could probably be found at any other chain restaurant.I was in awe of how expensive the drinks were - I got two ""Arnold Strongers"" and was shocked that the were almost 10$ each. They certainly didn\'t /taste/ like 10$ drinks.The atmosphere wasn\'t bad. They had TVs set up in the bar and would be a great atmosphere for groups or families.I\'d maybe come back for Happy Hour.. but definitely could find far better food and service elsewhere.",1.92,2.47,2.672,2.3760000000000003,2.2500000000000004
580,Rena H.,San Francisco  CA,22,44,24.0,2013-06-19,4.0,never had an entire meal of food here  but it is a pretty great place for a dessert and booze with the girls.

I tried the new Bison Burger - it was very slow coming out  very slow - and it was cold when I got it. I didn't say anything because I didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes for another one.BJ's is usually pretty good - I just think they aren't prepared for a busy crowd.,2.16,2.54,2.668,2.316,2.388
746,Karl K.,San Francisco  CA,0,205,5.0,2013-06-23,3.0,Who are we kidding? You'd only ever eat here to watch a game with your friends. Not my first choice  but in that whole South City/North of San Mateo area  you could do a lot worse. I'd definitely come here before Hooters. Not all the seats have good views of the TVs  so arrive early and claim a table with a good angle.Section near the bar is open seating  but it's really hard to get a good seat before a big game in that area without showing up 90 minutes before tipoff/kickoff.,2.24,2.55,2.66,2.252,2.426

999,Steven S.,Daly City  CA,494,87,7.0,2013-06-30,3.0,BJs is basically another elephant bar except they have way more beer on tap. I've had one really bad experience a couple years back which I still remember til this very day. I order some kind of spaghetti which didn't even taste like spaghetti. It tasted like cardboard with red sauce. It was so terrible that I didn't even eat the majority of it even though I was really hungry. I gave it three stars because if you avoid ALL of the itailan food  the place isn't that bad. The pizza  salad  nachos are all good selections which I recommend. Try getting their beer sampler if your food doesn't taste that good. Everything tastes better when you're drinking!,2.4,2.62,2.684,2.1559999999999997,2.532
472,Venus L.,San Bruno  CA,182,566,1124.0,2013-06-30,1.0,"After my visit to this BJ\'s  I came home sad and with a tummy ache. I know that experiences at restaurants could be a hit or a miss depending on when you go and who you get as your server. In this case  I guess it was a HUGE miss. First off  we had 7 people in our party so they sat us as one of the booths on the right side. Unfortunately  my dad is a pretty big person so one side sat 3 people and the other side sat 4. It was painful since we were pretty squished even with ""skinny girls"" and another guy. We weren\'t able to put a chair at the end of the table because that\'s considered a fire hazard which we totally understood. But it was just a painful dining experience. Next issue? The pizza. We ordered a large BJ\'s favorite and there was barely any toppings on the pizza which led us to think that we had gotten the wrong pizza. (We didn\'t. Boo.) And the pizza crust seemed WAY thinner than usual. Seriously? It became our least favorite thing on the menu. The rest of the food came out about 15-20 minutes after the pizza. And well  I\'m not sure about the others but my grilled chicken pasta came out cold. Not even slightly warm. Just... cold. And the chicken was dry. Needless to say  I was bummed but choked down the meal with the help of my root beer.And service? Our waiter was not in tune with our needs. And most of the time we had to flag him down. Which was not cool  especially since we saw him ask the tables around us repeatedly if they need anything. We felt ignored. So overall  eh. We agreed that it was gonna take A LOT for us to give this place another chance. I dunno. Maybe it was just a miss this time and next time it\'ll be a hit? We\'ll wait and see.",2.4,2.59,2.676,1.956,2.5140000000000002
339,Elaine Y.,San Francisco  CA,421,828,1298.0,2013-07-01,3.0,BJ's has a very large menu (upwards of 15 pages) and serves a real hodgepod of items ranging from Asian fusion entrees to more traditional surf & turf dishes. Many of the dishes are calorie-heavy  so watch out. I've come here multiple times and some of my choices were real hits while others were just mediocre. This particular time  I ordered a bison burger and subbed the coleslaw for a watermelon arugula salad. My salad did not have arugula...it was a spring mix of spinach and red leaf lettuce topped with cubed watermelon and feta cheese. I found the mix very tasty. As for my burger  I ordered it medium  but it was definitely overcooked and almost tough to eat. I tried a bit of my mom's thai chicken mango salad. That was delicious. It had mangoes  avocado  sesame seeds  and a mix of bell peppers. Yum. I also tried a little bite of my dad's pulled pork sandwich. It was swimming in BBQ sauce  not really my thing. My brother had the chicken fried steak...it was a HUGE plate. It also definitely looked like a piece of steak compared to other places that serve it as a deep fried hamburger. It came with 2 large pieces served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of steamed zucchini and cauliflower.All in all  BJ's in comparable to the Cheesecake factory...but features some more unique dishes. It's also just a tad cheaper.,2.44,2.61,2.668,2.1559999999999997,2.542
1375,Danelle F.,San Mateo  CA,4,6,,2013-07-04,1.0,We have never been to Tanforan B.J's location before  only San Mateo. We were seated and our waiter came up and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. My husband ordered a soda and I ordered a water. After we did this he went down 2 tables down from us and was chitchating with some young people who looked to be friends of his. 8 minutes later he dropped off my water and my husbands soda and before my husband could even get a single word out that he would like a straw he was already back at his friends table just talking away. Needless to say we were a bit frustrated but oh well we will just catch him when he comes back to get our orders. When he finally came back he took our order and we figured ok fine. So husband ordered pork chops and I ordered soup. So when waiter came back with food he dropped off food as he walked by. Not even stopping at the table he just kept walking until he got back to friends table. My husband looked down and said where are green beans? and I just shook my head. Meanwhile as waiter just walked past our table and went directly back to friends table at which time he spent 13 min talking to them. Finally we asked another waiter to grab our waiter which he did. The waiter comes back giving us a look like we have inconvenienced him somehow. My husband asks him doesn't this come with green beans and waiter said yes. Husband then asks him well where are they and the waiter looks at my husband and says. They are in the kitchen. At this point we are very angry. As a customer at this establishment I would never have expected such a fresh mouth from a waiter. At this point we asked to speak to his manager and he said ok. 10 min later manager was at our table and we explained what happened. At this point manager took over and took pork chop back and started over. He brought pork chop back with green beans and potatoes but by this time we were just too angry to eat. You would have thought that the manager would have comped at least my husbands meal at least knowing how inappropriate his employee was. But of course he did not. We will NEVER return to this location and probably never back to this establishment because of the kind of service we got today.,2.44,2.59,2.668,1.8920000000000003,2.5300000000000002
1039,Mark S.,Hayward  CA,8,146,3.0,2013-07-07,3.0,Service better than food. Food luke warm to say the best. Fish in tacos small. Pull pork sandwich is mostly bread. Waiter had food prepared as ordered. Unfortunately the food was not hot. It would be a good place if the food was hot. I would only come back if the food would be hot.,2.48,2.58,2.668,2.0920000000000005,2.54
750,El A.,South San Francisco  CA,9,125,40.0,2013-07-18,2.0,Went to BJ's yesterday with a party of 7. In addition to appetizers  we ordered a couple of large specialty deep dish pizzas. Although the service was great  we were so disappointed with the quality of the pizza. Let's see  how can I put this nicely? The deep dish pizza was 80% bread. I've tasted better quality pizzas at Pizza Hut and Dominoes.,2.48,2.58,2.668,1.9920000000000002,2.54
650,Sara N.,South San Francisco  CA,5,16,19.0,2013-07-18,3.0,This is just an easy go-to place for happy hour. The food isn't amazing  and the staff can be hit or miss. I've been lucky to get very good service the past few times I've been here. I think the drinks are over priced  but the food is better than similar chain restaurants. Love (4+ stars)1) BJ's Famous Pizookie - Really indulgent dessert that I love. Hot of the oven large chocolate chip cookie w/ vanilla bean ice cream. Can't go wrong with this one at all! 2) Pizookie Trio - Three small cookies topped w/ ice cream. You can choose between Chocolate Chunck  White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  Peanut Butter  Oatmeal Raisin Walnut  Cookies 'N Cream or Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli. Haven't tried the Oatmeal or the Cookies 'N Cream  but all the other flavors are great!Like (3 Stars)1) Great White Pizza - Deep dish pizza with Alfredo sauce with mushrooms  garlic  seasoned tomatoes  Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. I don't enjoy this pizza as much as the first time I ate it a couple years ago  but it's still a good go to. 2) Chicken Wontons (Thai style) - These are good small apps with a great Thair flavor. Nothing amazing...sometimes too oily  but they're a pretty safe bet.3) Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Nothing special  but they're still pretty good. They do get soggy  so eat them right away!4) Chicken Potstickers - Really good app  but over priced! I could honestly buy a bag of frozen Potstickers and make the same thing at home. But my gripe is w/ the price  not the taste of the dish.5) Boneless Chicken Wings (Maui Sweet Teriyaki Glaze) - very good and if you go at the right time they're part of the happy hour special. Great portion size  and great flavor. The glaze was a bit sweet and spicy. Defiantly a safe bet.6) Island Sunset  Tickled Pink  & Peechy Keen Snagria - They're all OK drinks  but nothing special at all.Pass (1 or 2 stars)1) Chicken Wontons (Buffalo style) - These are a hard pass...the flavor just is not there!2) Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms - These are small app that I thought were VERY bland.3) Avocado Egg Rolls - Really heavy and greasy. I can't say I dislike them all together  but I felt a bit sick after eating them they're so rich.4) Crispy Calamari - I should know better than to order calamari here...it was terrible. Not crispy at all  just chewy and really room temp. The lemon garlic aioli was so incredibly bland. Just BLAH all around. PASS on this one for sure!,2.56,2.58,2.672,2.0600000000000005,2.572
761,Monette P.,Vacaville  CA,69,70,71.0,2013-07-19,3.0,it is the best you can get for a mall restaurant. I don't mind the food but the staff can really be hit or miss.  25% of the time i get really lucky and have a fantabulous waiter who is on top of it and friendly to me and my kids. about the other 75% of the time i get some rude inattentive person and have to run laps to get someones attention for a refill (i've walked up to the bar myself a couple of times). I go here often because of its location and late hours. I just wish their staff was better trained in customer service and organization.,2.6,2.6,2.672,1.9640000000000002,2.6

1067,Chris C.,Las Vegas  NV,18,17,,2013-07-20,2.0,For a place that prides itself on its pizza  this was an unacceptable experience. I ordered the BJ specialty pizza  expecting a deep dish. I did not get a deep dish (perhaps that was my fault for not checking to see)  but what was worse was the fact that the pizza was soggy on the bottom. The top was cooked okay  but the bottom was soggy. The pizza was placed on a large place which may have been the reason  but the pizza was lukewarm and the bottom was soggy. It was pretty gross.My mom ordered desert and got their beignets (I can't remember how to spell the name). It tasted very generic. Too sweet  very plastic  very processed. It didn't taste fresh  it tasted heated up. I've had a number benaitslkwoiaiasdf from New Orleans to Disney World to fairs and farmers markets  but that was probably the tackiest benaipwnapsifjasl I've ever had.I've been to other BJ restaurants that were much better.

And in the end I walked away with little nod of approval.BJ\'s is not pretending to be something it\'s not. If you want Gary Danko then go to Gary Danko. But if you want a place that 1. Has choices pizza to steak to ""I\'ll try the halibut"" 2. Comfortable casual setting with good bordering on great service. 3. Easy access right off 280 with miles of parking.Bingo Bango Bongo! The tri-fecta!So I have to ask  why the three star rating? The wine list doesn\'t include a vintage Burgundy? It\'s a beer place!

692,Jerome B.,Alexandria  VA,43,89,11.0,2013-07-27,1.0,Good god! This when I was here with my wife  I was immediately assaulted with the reek of weed. And although I try to be pretty accepting of today's youth - this place was over-ridden with a bunch of young gang bangers (infested seemed too strong a word  yet strangely appropriate).  To top it off - the service here sucked  and the drinks are suspect (would suspect that if inspectors came with a hydrometer - they would lose their licence). Been to other BJs - was expecting at least a standard equal to those... but this place seemed hell bent on lowering the bar. Kudos team - mission accomplished.,2.56,2.57,2.68,1.7640000000000002,2.566
1085,Aman K.,San Francisco  CA,0,33,,2013-07-31,4.0,One of my favorite spots in SF to just eat  talk and enjoy the evening. Great menu with a lot varieties from food to dessert to drinks. Pazookie (dessert) is a must for me at this place. The only reason i am not giving 5 starts is because of the wait and slow service during the weekend.,2.68,2.57,2.68,2.16,2.614

If I go in at 2:00 PM (as I did today) I get terrible service. It took over an hour just to get a hamburger. I brought my guests from the airport and was very disappointed.,2.72,2.56,2.676,1.8960000000000001,2.624

To cut to the chase  after eating about half of her pasta  my girlfriend found what looked like a giant staple in her food. She informed the waiter  who was a nice enough guy  and he told us he would bring the manager who offered her another order of pasta. He told us it may have fallen in during cleaning?! Uhhh  that does not make us feel any better. Now she also has massive stomach pains. Awesome. If she swolled that staple she could've choked. The least the manager could have done was cover our whole meal  which was only about $20 by the way. So cheap. Never again BJ's.,2.68,2.53,2.668,1.7640000000000002,2.59

Our waiter decided to go on break in the middle of serving us  so his 3 back up guys  who've I've seen maybe twice in the hour and a half of me being here  have taken over. I ordered a pasta dish that was supposed to be filled with spinach and artichokes in a cream sauce with grilled chicken. What do I get? Barely any pasta  maybe 3 spinach leaves and 2 big ass pieces of deep fried chicken  along with no cream sauce. Delish  right? Wrong. Absolutely disgusting. I could've made this meal at home instead of paying $15. I've been here multiple times before and my only complaint has been that their food is basic and kind of flavorless. Tonight ruined it for me. Never EVER coming back.,2.64,2.48,2.656,1.7320000000000002,2.544

Went in this past Saturday  and it was the worst experience. It was my birthday and I wanted a great lunch...Well it didn\'t happen! Got there and was seated immediately...Our server took our drink orders and 15 minutes later she still hadnt returned. Another woman came with drinks finally and announced herself as the ""new server""...She took our orders  but never returned...She comes back with another server named John...and said he was the ""rightful server""...I guess they name themselves all the special names. We were hungry and just wanted our food at this point...Our food finally did come...But our appetizer(avocado rolls) came AFTER our main entree. The manager came to our table with a blank face and simply stated  I will take these off the bill for you...He acted like he was doing us a favor for their mistake. Our food was under-cooked  and sent back! Im assuming they were short staffed  which is common  but you should NOT seat people in areas where there is NO help. We would of been content on just waiting or going to another nearby restaurant...at this point  a Big Mac would of been better than the mess we were served! Although our food was under-cooked and cold  we still paid our bill and tipped John more than 18%...it wasn\'t his fault. He tried to do damage control but it was too late. I would suggest anyone coming here think twice about it...And if you feel like you just have to eat BJ\'s right now  select John as your server.",2.52,2.47,2.652,1.7960000000000003,2.49

Sometimes they are quick and food arrives on a timely matter  but sometimes it takes way too long. Three days ago  service was quick and our waitress was awesome. We didnt have to ask her for refills or anything during lunch with 4 other family members. Today  09/31  my husband and I had lunch there and our waiter had us waiting forever after we were seated. i got pissed. i didn't get to eat a pizookie (dessert) because I didnt want to wait again for that.,2.44,2.5,2.656,2.1239999999999997,2.476
773,Raquel G.,Millbrae  CA,11,18,9.0,2013-09-03,1.0,Tonight I ordered food online to be ready in time to grab on my way to pick up my bf from work. I show up on schedule to pick up the food and no one seems to know where my food is so the to go girl goes in the back to check with her manager. She returns about 5min later to let me know they aren't sure why my order was never made and that she already put in the order to be ready in 10mins. That made me feel ok so I say and waited. I paid full price for my late order and didn't even receive an apology from the manager which felt like poor customer service. She showed up in about 15min with my order. In a hurry I didn't have a chance to double check the order. My bf and I get home  take out our food to discover that his food is perfect and mine is a mess. My order was a Santa Fe salad with blackened shrimp. -My blackened shrimp was not blackened and barley cooked-The lettuce was wet and soggy even though I didn't even have dressing on it-There was no corn or cheese -There was a piece of chicken-There was a piece of something that resembled grown beefI brushed off having to wait for my order to be made but to serve me something incomplete and unsatisfactory was unacceptable.

We sat in the lounge area during football  which may have been our first mistake. The service wasn\'t good. We had one ""server"" but had to ask for help from several other people over the course of the night. Everything we asked for took forever. My margarita had something floating in the glass so they had to make me another one  which took another 10 minutes to arrive. They obviously didn\'t have enough staff working or the people they did have were not capable of handling a busy area. The silver lining of this place was the bartender.

Over the 6+ times we went there  every single time we had to wait a very long time for a server to come to us and about 75% of the time there would be an error with our order. I ordered a steak there twice and both times ordered medium-rate but it came to me well-done. Very slow service and an unappealing ""corporate"" feel to it.

637,Niko P.,Sacramento  CA,6,10,,2013-09-09,1.0,We decided to give BJ's one last good faith chance after our rough experience last time. What a mistake this was. BJ's has officially hit the bottom of the barrel. The experience started with the initial phone call to put our name down on our way in. We have never had a problem with this before and they supposedly welcome call ins. At least you would think so. The girl who answered the phone was rude and snarky. After 5 minutes of telling her that we had some it before she finally allowed it. She was rude from the get go. We should have taken that as a sign. Foolishly we continued forward. Next  terrible staff. Complete rush job to line their pockets. They rush you to order and are rude about it. I barely finished my order before the menu was ripped out of my hands. Same goes for my dining companion. While waiting forever for our food  we had a hovering employee literally standing behind our table starting and just waiting. Making us very uncomfortable. Also  it is quite apparent that texting and phone calls are more important than doing your job and talking care of the customer. I watched one girl flat out ignore a customer directly in her line of sight. Only to pull her phone out and type out a lengthy text and then walk away from said customer. Management isn't much better. Didn't care about any customer concerns or lack of customer service by his employees. He just stood there at the drink station doing nothing. Also having a terrible attitude. Finally the food gets there. This was after watching 3 innings of the baseball game totaling about 30 minutes. The pizza we ordered was very dry. Little to no sauce whatsoever. That is sad some their pizza used to be awesome. The cajun pasta was undercooked. Very stiff rubbery noodles. Couldn't even flag anyone down to bring it to their attention. The second it looked like we were done eating  the plates are snatched away and the check was on the table. Good thing I was done with my pasta. I wouldn't have had time to tell them I was still working on it. This is the worst experience I've had at BJ's ever. There will be no next time from us. Save yourself some money and go somewhere else. Even Hotdog on a Stick would be better than this. There are better places to go.,2.24,2.48,2.652,1.988,2.3840000000000003
1009,Simon W.,Walnut Creek  CA,9,87,,2013-09-10,1.0,A pretty awful experience. Ordered an appetizer and two main courses. The main courses of Moroccan fish came pretty quickly but looked like they'd been slapped on the plate and the food was barely warm. The appetizer arrived a few minutes after the main course. The server apologized and was sending the manager over but they never came. Ended the night asking them to call a cab and after 15 minutes they said it was here but it was another customer picking up takeout. 40 minutes later we get our own. Awful service  sub standard food compared to the other BJ locations I've visited. If I could rate it with zero stars I would.,2.24,2.48,2.644,2.084,2.3840000000000003

It seems like most people have a problem with the bad service at this place  but this review is only based on the food. I've had their pizza  crispy chicken sandwich  pot roast  and a variety of their appetizers. The crispy chicken sandwich is DELICIOUS! It's pretty big (for me)  so I usually eat it for 2 meals  and it heats up nicely. I wasn't a fan of their thin  crispy fries (might be because they got soggy since we did takeout)  but the wedge fries are decent. Overall  I think the food is above average. There have been a few appetizers that I didn't care for like the wontons  but most things I've had here  I have liked. This is our go-to place if we work late and don't have time to prepare dinner.,2.2,2.44,2.656,2.512,2.3440000000000003

Every time Ive came it takes on average 15 minutes just to get greeted by a server and when the server finally arrives none of them seem the least bit happy to serve you.

He\'s always in a great mood  and knows everything I need before I even ask!! I made a yelp just to write this review on what excellent service he provides. Tonight I came in and didn\'t seat in Stewarts section so I expected to wait 15min before getting greeted (which I did) and eventually I asked a server ""Do you know who the server is for this section? I\'ve been waiting for a while."" Vlattamier replied saying ""Either you wait to be seated or wait for your server  that\'s how it works here. He will come around  just wait!"" I was so upset! Moments later Stewart came over with water and said he can be my server. Even though I wasn\'t in his section.

I ordered the hefeweizin pitcher $16.75 and a classic burger about $9'sh. Surprisingly the food is good (of course the experienced cook was there). Afterwards  ordered 1 pint of bj hef for $4 (reasonable prices/good service).

By 12:15  we were still waiting for our soup  salad and fish tacos. The place was already packed with corporate lunch goers from nearby offices and most of them were eating already!! What's wrong with this picture? When I spoke with the server  he just came up with a bunch a bs excuses.. We even had to ask him for more water. Barely saw him an never checked up on us. When we asked to speak with the manager  he also took while to come over to talk to us. He listened and just apologized-- unconvincingly reassuring us he'll find out what's going on. Don't ever go to this one. What a waste of money. Felt like we could have had a better lunch experience at the Five Guys food court nearby.,2.08,2.41,2.644,2.18,2.2780000000000005

But she spoke as if that wasn\'t an option. So we just sat at the table instead and let her know. And she just like .... decided not to inform any of the other waiters. So we sat there for a long time going unnoticed until I finally got annoyed enough to wave down a passing waiter who was just like ohh she\'ll handle you pointing to some other waitress. Then that waittress was just like I\'ll be right with you. And I was just like omg.I\'ve worked in food service before so I know how NOT HARD it is to give good service. You smile and attend to a customer ASAP andleave them with absolute confidence that someone will help them soon. Instead of just a bunch of ""I don\'t knows"" and passing down the service to another and another and another person.So step your shit up BJ\'s.

1115,Edgar G.,San Francisco  CA,221,404,9.0,2013-10-12,1.0,I've dined at this BJ's many times for the past 7 years  but tonight was the worst experience ever. First  it took about 10 minutes for our waiter to introduce us  and by that time we were already ready to order out entree. In addition  we ordered two appetizers and he promised they would come out before our entree  but isn't that normally how it works? We waited another 15-20 minutes and for some odd reason our entrees came out before our appetizer. Our waiter also didn't notify us that he was going on break  so I informed his replacement about our appetizers. He made sure to double check on our order but it never came. We asked to cancel one but to bring out the chips and salsa since its easier to make and it would've taken another 20 minutes to make the mushroom spinach appetizer. I finished my entree before the appetizer even came out  so that frustrated me. The waiter told us it was coming and by that time I just wanted my check. I asked for the manager but he never came out. Was he that ashamed of his employees to not speak to a customer about their poor customer service? I don't know but I know he wasn't busy and was dodging my table. All I wanted to tell him was how disappointed I was with my dinner and that I've never had a bad experience prior. All in all  the manager really showed me what this BJ franchise is really about. I will never step foot in this particular BJ's again. The least the manager could have done was come over and apologize  comp our meal and wish we would come dine again.,2.08,2.4,2.62,2.212,2.2720000000000002
694,Bryce M.,Newport Beach  CA,49,108,20.0,2013-10-13,2.0,I've been to three BJ's locations in California  and this one definitely comes in at the bottom spot. As someone who has worked in a customer service role (and knows what a pain it can be)  it's not very hard to impress me. All I want is your attention for a brief moment  a greeting of any kind  and a thank you. Unfortunately  the girls at the front desk failed miserably on the greeting and attention front. There was no real greeting  and they seemed to be more interested in their own conversation. Blah.....Our waiter  whose name I don't remember  was adequate. He was knowledgeable  friendly  and relatively attentive. I would give him 4 stars.Okay  now comes the most important part  the food. The soup  Tomato Bisque  was excellent. I'd recommend asking for crackers to add as well. That would be the saving grace for me return to this location. The salad  however  was terrible. The lettuce was wilted  there was hardly any dressing (I couldn't even see any)  and there was no croutons on my cesar salad (lol!).Overall  it was a less than ideal experience. I may even be able to look past the bad salad if the customer service was excellent from start to finish. The girl at the check in desk was just really bad.,2.12,2.4,2.62,2.3120000000000003,2.2880000000000003

640,Jenna H.,San Francisco  CA,352,235,15.0,2013-10-16,1.0,I wish I could give a review for the food  but sadly never got that far. I'll admit it was bad thinking on my part to come here on football sunday  but I was disappointed with their inaccurate and unorganized manner. Initially came and was told a 20min wait. My boyfriend and I put our name on the list and waited. We noticed there was a side area to eat in (in the mall) was was fairly empty. There were maybe 3 current parties in this section  and plenty of 2 or 4 seat tables. We asked if moving ourselves to that list would expedite our wait. One of the hostesses went to check  and said there were several parties on that list and it would take approximately 15 minutes. We thought it was odd  cause it was fairly open  but we decided to keep to our current estimated wait. 25 min later: we asked the hostess where we were on the list. She approximated another 20 minute wait. The boyfriend was too hungry so we decided to find something faster in the mall. As we walked out  we noticed the side area had maybe one larger party of 5 (in addition) that was in the area  but there were a couple 2-seat booths still available.Smh...,2.2,2.38,2.612,2.18,2.308
647,Adorable T.,Burlingame  CA,51,206,134.0,2013-10-21,1.0,"I didn\'t think this could happen  but I had an even worse experience than last time. The server was a sweet gentleman  but could not get the order right for half of the table. We came with a table of 9 around 7:45pm on a Sunday night to watch the game. The wait was about 45 minutes.I ordered the chicken club (recommended by the server) without mayo and with the bacon on the side (to share with my sister). Food came with mayo and with no bacon. I let the mayo slide although this could be a health request. Nevertheless  I reminded the server that I wanted the bacon on the side. Another person at my table did not get her correct order either.It was also my sister\'s bday  so we wanted to get a pizooki sampler (3 small pizookis). I asked him quietly on the side to present it with a candle to my sister sitting a few seats away from me on the other side of the table (which I pointed out). He comes back with one chocolate pizooki with a candle and asks me which person it goes to. Not the right order. Not longer a surprise. Not happy at this point.I mentioned to him that was not what I ordered  and he immediately put in the request for the pizooki. By that time  no one wanted to eat a pizooki anymore. Literally 2 minutes after I asked for the order to be cancelled. He ""asked his manager"" and couldn\'t cancel the order because they were in the process of making the platter.....................................Really? For someone who keeps on f\'ing up orders  the least you can do is to cancel this. No one wants to eat the mediocre food anymore.Get the pizooki  no one wants to eat it  asked for the check.Split the checks with 3 cards (the limit) and wrote the card names and totals at the top of the bill. He came back with some random totals for each card. Wth??? He also said one of the cards declined... which was weird  because it worked earlier for this person.Confused. When he I returned  I told him the totals were at the top and that he mischarged multiple credit cards.He apologized and went back to fix the mistake. This included running my friend\'s card again which went through fine.Service is a huge part of the dining out experience! I should not have to feel stressed or annoyed when I\'m eating out. Not sure what\'s up with the waiters here (or manager for not cancelling a pizooki order--seriously  it\'s worth $ and can be disposed of)  but I would not come again.Food is mediocre at best.",2.12,2.35,2.6,2.2760000000000002,2.2580000000000005
1019,Dave B.,Pittsburg  CA,3,105,,2013-10-22,2.0,It was OK for what it was. Lots of carbs  plenty of fried foods  and plenty of noise in this restaurant. They tried to seat is us in the outside Mall area when there were plenty of seats inside the real restaurant. We sat inside. We sent back their micro beer. It was nothing like a Guinness. My wife drank part of hers. We then ordered wine. The service was good. The place was clean. I ate my food and felt guilty for consuming so many calories. Is BJ's a chain from Texas? It seemed like it could be.,2.04,2.34,2.596,2.3760000000000003,2.2199999999999998
850,Lily W.,San Francisco  CA,117,9,,2013-10-24,3.0,"I came here twice in one week because of a Google Offer deal that offers a 3 course meal for 2 for $19.95. (It\'s still going on. Expires: Nov. 11. 2013) The 3 courses include your choice of soup/salad  medium pizza  and a pizookie! What a steal! First time:Although I wasn\'t really in the mood for pizza  I was excited to eat at BJ\'s for the first time because I have been wanting to try the much raved about pizookie. My verdict after the meal: it was just....ok.FOOD:Soups: Clam chowder and Mexican tortilla. Before I mention taste...why was my soup lukewarm? It should be hot! On to taste:Clam chowder was tasty and had nice chunks of clams. Mexican tortilla was too salty. Pizza: Deep dish BBQ Ranch chicken. I don\'t like dip dish  but the pizza was pretty good.I actually wouldn\'t even call it deep dish  because it was more of a thick bread with a semi-thick topping. Pizookie: Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top. I can see why people like it because it was tasty  but it was way too sweet for me. I couldn\'t finish it. DRINKS:Beer: 8 samplers  including the seasonal pumpkin flavored beer. They make their own beer! My favorite was the oasis and blondie  while my sister liked the piranha. SERVICE:Where is my water??? My server seemed to have forgotten to bring my table water  so I asked the next server walking by for some water. He jokingly commented: ""So you must be thirsty"" before leaving to get my water ""Uhhh  yeah I\'m thirsty. I have been sitting here for over 10 minutes without water"" is what I said in my head. He came back with ONE cup of water while my sister sitting across from me eyed me with disbelief. You\'re kidding me  right?!Another thing is that the waiter forgot to bring our to-go boxes after our meal. He only brought our boxes over after he saw my sister eyeing him with boxes in hand for another table while walking by. Despite the mediocre service and food  I went back two days later with my sister and parents because it\'s still a good deal! The second time around  the food was still mediocre but the service was much better. Our server was very attentive despite making some mistakes. She gave us the wrong order. We ordered the BBQ chicken hand-tossed pizza and realized it was the buffalo chicken pizza after taking a bite  but we decided to keep it anyway since we already took a big chunk from the pizza. She also forgot to apply the discount at the end  but she realized her mistake before I spoke when she saw my phone in hand and apologized for it. We forgave her for her mistakes because our food came in a timely manner  she made sure we were enjoying our food and cleaned up the extra plates taking up space on the table without asking. As for the food that day  there isn\'t much to add  except to GET THE CRISPY POTATO SKINS!! I A bit pricey for an appetizer  but I loveee potatoes and these were perfect!

So Derrick  in the bar  thank you again for the stellar service. I hope you enjoyed the big tip and that we pulled the manager aside to let him know you deserved a raise and promotion!

I love that the menu has so many options compared to other places I've been to  I can always find something I can eat (veggie/pescatarian food). The very first time I went here I had fish tacos and a very very nice server! Too bad haven't seen her since. I usually get the fettuchini Alfredo and its always consistent. I like it here better than other places. And the strawberry daiquiri is bomb too. My usual order consists of those two plus a side of thick wedge cut fries! Yum! And they have lunch specials. Now I'm really craving some! There are also many TVs so when it's baseball season you know I'm there!,2.44,2.42,2.616,2.516,2.428

1059,Nicholas G.,San Francisco  CA,1,32,,2013-10-29,4.0,The food here is excellent and the service is great. I take my family here all the time. If you have a child that will need high-chair  be sure to tell them when they put your name down on the waiting list. There have been a few times we've had to give up our table because it would not accommodate a high-chair. Also  the waits are often very long on weekend evenings. You can call ahead to put your name down on the list but that often doesn't seem to help much. For example  we would call and they would quote us about a 30-45 minute wait. When we get there 30 minutes later  they then say it will be another 30-45 minutes. WTF?! The one nice thing about the wait is that you can walk around the mall area a little instead of standing in their small waiting area. I know the buzzer works throughout the Barnes & Noble which is right across from them.,2.32,2.42,2.62,2.288,2.38

I liked the multiple screen tv in front of the bar so I could watch 4 things at once. At shift change the second bartender wasn't nearly as attentive  otherwise I'd have given this place 5 stars which is something I just don't do with chains restaurants.,2.44,2.43,2.632,2.192,2.434

It started with the rude girl on the phone when I tried to call ahead  which BJ\'s encourages you to do mind you...She made me wait for 3 minutes on hold just to give my name! We get there ten minuets later and are told it\'s a ten  minute wait  which would had been fine had that been the truth. The truth was it was a 25 minute wait and we only went there because we had a movie to go to and we had just over one hour by the time the ten minute waiting time lie was told to us. Just as I was about to go set the stupid buzzer device on the counter and leave  it buzzed. Was a total mistake to stay! My sons dad had to seriously go searching for silverware and napkins! Seriously! He was actually told by a server that they ""were out""!!!! WTF!?!?! We finally get some that were so hot we had to let them cool for five minutes just so we could eat our side salads. They got my sons order wrong which was a super simple order too. Brought our drinks about 25 minutes after we had been seated and AFTER we were done with our salads and all we ordered was iced tea  oj  and a beer. OMG! Was like we were being filmed on a hidden camera show to test our patience. Just kept reiterating how this location does not deserve another chance. I have been to 6 other Bay Area BJ\'s and not one other one except the Tanforan location is god awful.

671,Chris T.,San Francisco  CA,320,53,14.0,2013-11-03,1.0,"I took my son here for what I hoped would be a fun ""guy\'s night"" dinner where we could watch some college football together.We got there a bit before the rush. It was busy  but since we were only two people  we were seated quickly. Most groups waiting and that were already seated seemed to be 6+. I overheard the manager telling someone who had walked in with a party of 10 that their wait could be 2 hours. So keep that in mind.The food is that kind of perfectly chewable  extremely-loaded-with-calories-and-salt lab-created food that large chain mall restaurants have. It\'s good because it\'s engineered that way. I had a french dip that had the most bizarre au jus I\'ve ever tasted -- it was like teriyaki  but not.The server sized us up as being a cheap bill immediately and behaved that way. He asked us if we wanted to order right after being handed the menu  and if I wanted dessert with my mouth full of my entree. Anything that could have gotten us out of there faster would have made him ecstatic. He also had rehearsed jokes (""I\'ll have a french dip"" .. ""he just left!"") and kept nudging me on the shoulder when he wanted to say something to me.The other thing is  along with the menu  he presented me with a frequent diner card form and said I should fill it out. Throughout the meal  he kept trying to upsell me this stupid frequent diner card  saying things to my son like ""Dad let you use that pen instead of filling out the card"".Now  whoever at Corporate HQ thinks that pushing these frequent diner cards are a good idea needs to have their head checked. It\'s terribly annoying for customers and I can\'t imagine the upside is worth annoying a potential return customer with the hard upsell. If servers are incentivized to push this thing  seriously  stop it.We contemplated dessert but our waiter started paying more attention to the table of 10 that walked in next to us. So my son and I had the highlight our of meal  which was sharing a dip code at the nearby DQ. I recommend going there instead.",2.36,2.39,2.624,1.8600000000000003,2.378

We were lead to our seats by a rather unfriendly hostess who handed us our menus and left. We ordered two dishes and an appetizer from our server who seemed nice enough  but as we discovered later  had a habit of disappearing. Our food came quickly  but our order was messed up- when the right dish came it was only slightly warm. We spent half of our meal without drinks and when we asked our waiter for an extra ranch it never arrived.

722,Kevin C.,Hingham  MA,10,45,,2013-11-14,2.0,I heard this chain was good and thought I'd check it out for lunch. Boy was I disappointed. I wanted to eat somewhat light  so I didn't go with the pizza or burger  which was probably my mistake. That's their signature items. They have a large menu  which is a big mistake for a chain like this I think. They should stick to what they do well.I got a side salad....it was mostly white iceberg lettuce  very little green  and what was green was very light green. Then the shrimp tacos. The tacos were decent  but it came with tortilla chips  a small ramekin of salsa and one of a creamy avacado sauce. Well the chips were greasy  which was unappetizing. We all know chips are made by deep frying but they don't usually come out and stay shiny and wet with grease. Then the ramekins were so small  you couldn't dip your chip into the salsa or sauce. That defeats the use of chips. Just dumb decision by the restaurant. Service was good (I ate at the bar). I didn't try the beer  but maybe that would be their saving grace.,2.68,2.4,2.612,1.768,2.512
636,Diana S.,Daly City  CA,261,6,2.0,2013-11-18,2.0,"A year ago--- I had a party of 12 to celebrate a friends birthday. We gathered our party to the bar area and was able to seat ourselves. First server was very nice but left us to another server. She was nice  busy and could do better in making is feel welcome to her section. We ordered. We waited for the whole party to join us than order so more. She didn\'t ring up our food up until we are all ready as a whole group.Finally we waited. Got our drinks  food and appetizers. THE FOOD RUNNER was absolutely rude. ""I have a pizza"" stares at us with a mad face making us feel we order something wrong. Simply made the mood of party a bummer. I let it go but my party was upset for the rude service. He comes back with more food and just stands there waiting for us to grab it and pass it down the long table. he goes ""I have a bunch of pizookies"" glares at us with an angry with the ""I don\'t like my job look"". I get upset and so does my party. Our server is trying her best to accommodate us but I felt she rushed us and could of gave us a better service but her efforts were there even though there was ALOT of mistakes.But this review is for the food runner. The overall tone was set when he rudely came up to our table. I took matters in my hand and asked for the manager. Great Guy!!! Heard me out and I explained to him our problem and overall experience. He apologize and was able to comp out desert. Overall I wanted to leave the store and let the manager know the situation. Business is based on good service and great food.

In the meantime  a few of the runners delivered her son his ""mini sliders"" meal. He picked up one to begin eating and they then realized that they had brought the order to the wrong table. They took the plate back and we watched them bring it to another incorrect table before finding the correct one. I had to go and find a booster seat myself and felt the customer service was awful!

I arrive on time and was told my table would be available in 15 minutes. I got a table at 8:30pm. I politely asked what was the point of calling in to reserve a table if I still have to wait an hr. Then this coordinator girl ease drops on my conversation with a nice polite girl and explains to me why in a very rude way. I wasn't even talking to her in the first place. Then I sit down to eat and order a fried calamari that probably got reduce by 50 percent while charging the same price. I know this cause I come often  twice a week at one point. Service is bad too.

I'd been here a few times before this most recent dismal experience  so I knew to keep expectations low  but it was so bad I just have to warn people. My boyfriend wanted to go somewhere to watch a game that wouldn't be on our home channels. Just stick with beer for drinks. My bf ordered a margarita that was so bad  it tasted like the cheapest powered lemonade mix and tasted so weird and artificial he sent it back for a mojito which also tasted like a cheap mix and you could tell they didn't muddle it  just threw a few mint leaves in there. The food was worse; it seems worse every time I go to a BJ's. Everything tasted like it had been sitting under a warmer for at least an hour. My fish tacos were basically tortillas with some gross mayonaise sauce  and the grilled fish was one piece about as big as my pinky finger. No kidding  it was like they put one really tiny fish stick in each taco. No flavor. Served with that awful fake guacamole  just horrible. The server was trying to get us out as fast as possible because it was busy. She pushed for our dessert order while my bf was still eating his meal.I will never go back to BJ's ever again if I can help it.,2.6,2.34,2.592,1.604,2.444

I tired buying kegs here before and the manager was pretty confused  i guess i was like the second person ever. Pizza is not bad for Chicago style. Although everything else i've tried here was pretty mediocre  not bad  just very average. Lots of Tv's service is a little weird here sometimes  usually have to wait  bar should be more separate in MHO  but I would be down to come here with a friend.

The food is awesome tho...I've had the pizza  pasta  salmon  appetizers and even the drinks are yummy!!! The service isn't bad either I have never had a bad experience with a server so far. So if you ever get hungry after a long day of shopping and do not want food court food come to bj's at Tanforan you won't be disappointed!

So while we were waiting we ordered a total of 3 rounds of shots and some apps. Finally my other 2 friends showed up at 6:30pm so we ordered 7 more shots-almost a double shot per person and some cocktails. Since HH ends at 7pm we squeezed in 3 more shots. That\'s a total of 16 shots among 4 of us. It may sound like a lot but trust me it wasn\'t. They totally skimp on the shots..it\'s about 50% less than what other places would normally serve. That\'s why we had to double it up. Right when we received all our drinks and our food and was getting ready to dig in and ENJOY our Friday  a manager named Cacy came over to us and starts asking us if we were ""OK"" and if we needed anything else. We told him everything was good...but yet he still lingered at our table and gave us this weird vibe. We can tell his intentions were not simply just checking in on his customers. So finally I asked...""are you kicking us out?"" He replied ""No  but I won\'t be able to serve you guys any more drinks."" WHAT?!! We all just looked at each other in shock. Did we just get cutoff for the night??? At 7:05pm??? Yes we did!! His explanation was because we ordered too much within the last hour and he\'s concerned for our safety. We told him that we\'ve been here since 5pm...Almost half of it was ordered during that time and the last round we doubled it up because HH was ending. Our drinks were still on the table. He can clearly see that. Furthermore  we were not loud or rowdy at all. In fact the group next to us at the bar was pounding shots left n right  breaking glasses  and extremely loud but I\'m positive that they did not get cut off. What kind of BS is this? He totally offended and targeted us! Ok I can understand that you have your policies to abide by  but why not wait until we order the next round and then inform us of your ""cutoff"" policy. Why do it RIGHT AFTER we received our drinks and food? How do you expect us as customers to be able to enjoy our dining experience?? This was just absolutely Ridiculous. We were so pissed it\'s not even funny. We requested to speak to another manager regarding Cacy\'s offensive and unprofessional approach but it didn\'t get anywhere as well. He apologized and we accepted his apology at the time but we will never come back. NEVER.",2.72,2.36,2.584,1.5720000000000003,2.504

It took 30 minutes for the food to come out and that was only the salad. They even served us the salads without utensils. In addition  our waiter just disappeared after placing our order. I managed to flag down a different waiter to request cheese for my baked potato  but he never came back. Our main server hardly checked on us  we had to call three different waiters for our requests  such as sauce  condiments  and the bill. Overall  the service was horrible. We had to call a different waiter to tell the manager to get our bill. The food quality lacked. I had the New York steak which was on the dry side. My sister ordered the Top Sirloin with Lobster and the lobster didn't come out. We requested a separate dish for the lobster and ended up with a whole new plate including the sides and top sirloin; we got charged twice..,2.68,2.35,2.576,1.6680000000000001,2.482
1316,U T.,San Francisco  CA,0,9,4.0,2013-12-27,1.0,THIS PLACE HOSPITALIZE ME FROM FOOD POISON! My buddy and I went to watch a movie  so conveniently BJ is near by. We ask the front person how long is the wait  she told us 20 minutes  but we ended sat down around 60 minutes. Not much promising estimation on seating. I ordered this Alfredo or cheesy grilled chicken with pasta. The next morning I came down with a stomach flu with a severe bug issue from the grilled chicken. I was hospitalize for a week and place on antibiotic for two weeks. I contact the corporate office  they apologize  but try to contact the restaurant and they told the restaurant what happen. I tried to contact the restaurant because the corporate advice me to  to complete the investigation  but with no response from this franchise. I ask for the manager  but end up with ran around. I am very upset with them for ignoring me. Gotten me so sick and HOSPITALIZE  ignoring to complete the investigation  this place should be shut down! All I want is an apologies from the restaurant  that's all! They couldn't do that!,2.6,2.33,2.576,1.7000000000000002,2.438
856,Michael B.,Union City  CA,44,12,21.0,2013-12-28,3.0,Although the food is satisfactory and the pizookies are excellent as always  the hostess lost our reservation and forced my party to wait an extra 30 min  despite us calling in an hour ahead of time. Not only this  she did not put in an effort to resolve the issue  and whisked us away as if some nuisance. Umm ok?,2.52,2.35,2.572,1.9000000000000001,2.418
985,Una H.,San Bruno  CA,0,37,11.0,2013-12-29,1.0,"Been here several time with ok service. But this time (dinner Dec. 29) bad experience. Our server was Miguel.1.) Were told the wait is 20 minutes. We got seated 50 minutes later. 2.) We asked for water  no ice. Got water with ice. 3.) We already got our appetizers and salads  but no utensils and napkins. Took long time to get those. What? You want us to eat like we\'re in the Stone Age? With our hands?4.) Ordered Spaghetti with meatballs. No meatballs. When brought to server\'s attention  was told they don\'t really have meatballs but only meat is in the sauce. But told him it says in the menu:      ""Spaghetti with meat sauce......$11.00          with meatballs....................13.00""Got the meatballs  ga-zillion minutes later. Cmon server  we\'re not stupid. You are stupid for trying to wiggle your way out of this one with the stupid  lame excuse for getting the order wrong. Next time  just own up to it and fix it right away.5.) Dirty glass used for soda. At first it was not noticeable because glass was full. But as I drink I noticed spots and solid  dried up stuff on the glass. An unwashed  dirty glass. These are not just honest mistakes. These were due to laziness  inattentiveness  irresponsibleness. Clearly reflects on the character of this server. And Miguel  you\'re lucky to get $3.00 for a tip. Suppose to be none because of the bad service you provided. Wanna have bigger tips? Improve your service. And this is not an isolated incident with regard to bad service/experience. Check other reviews.",2.36,2.35,2.564,1.6680000000000001,2.354
564,Kat S.,Diamond Bar  CA,220,45,19.0,2013-12-29,1.0,My uncle and I came here today for lunch and we waited about 20-25 minutes. When we were about to be seated the table wasn't even cleaned off or sanitized off. So we were just standing there waiting for a busser to come clean it. Our server didn't provide utensils before our meals arrived and had to ask for them  which took a while. At this point we were kind of irritated already. I had ordered a side salad with my entree and my server didn't write it down and I never received it. And when we ordered our dessert it took maybe more than 20 minutes just for a pizookie. And we even got our check before our dessert was even served. So disappointed at this location because all the other times I've been to Bjs service had been great. Sad to say that I won't be returning to this location.,2.36,2.35,2.556,1.7960000000000003,2.354
1281,Steven T.,Hayward  CA,0,2,,2014-01-03,1.0,Worse experience ever  went here with my brother for lunch before we go shopping and i regret it terribly. We got seated right away  but we waited 20 minute for our waiter to come take our order or at least take down our drinks  but no one came. We ended up having to ask the host who our waiter was  waited another 5 min and we were just fed up and was about to walk out when the manager came by and apologized and he didn't even know what was going on  we ended up ordering here  we were hungry and didn't want to look for somewhere else to eat. I ordered a ahi tuna salad and a drink and my brother ordered a crusted chicken dish with soda  he tried offering us appetizers but i didn't want any. We waited for about 15 minute for our food to come  while i waited i see the manager chatting it up with the waiters and waitresses near the computer where they input orders. I was disappointed i paid 15 bucks for a plate of crap..i literally got a plate of salad with maybe 2-3 piece of ahi tuna which was covered in tons of wasabi and the size of a quarter  it literally looked like i got scraps of whats left over  the whole plate was loaded with fried oily crisp  and throughout the whole time we still had no waiter. We ended up paying full price for our food. Lets just say..this is the last i will ever eat here.,2.24,2.34,2.552,1.924,2.3
596,Calvin John B.,Honolulu  HI,365,118,49.0,2014-01-04,2.0,Of the three times that I've eaten there  never have I been completely satisfied with anything other than their beer. Whether it be service or food  most things I've experienced here were just sub-par. I'm not one to complain too often  but you start to question what is acceptable in terms of the standard of food preparation  quality  taste  and so forth.I'm a pasta person. Parmigiana's  lasagna's spaghetti's and linguini's are my cushion so if it's there  I'll go for it! Every time I get those here  they for some reason end up with only a scoop-full of sauce with the pasta as dry as the desert. Steaks  chickens and other meats are a toss up. Sometimes they're well cooked and other times they're just plain chewy.My most recent trip  and one that nudged me into writing this review  was with a group of co-workers and I for a holiday dinner. One of us ordered take-out from our server for a steak. It came out burnt. We told the server what had happened but in turn we were told that cooks had already been told to prepare it the way we asked. Truth is  we were never asked. Adding to that  when we were ready to pay  we tried raising our hands each time he passed but it wasn't until fifteen minutes later where we eventually asked another server for ours to come by. At times  we even caught him helping other tables out then leaving for the back room again. When he finally came over  he collected our cards and didn't come back for another couple of minutes or so. The entire experience made us pull hairs  as we'd already had a long day at work to begin with.But not all is completely lost. There was a server that sat us and took our orders just fine. He talked stories for a bit  told us he'd been doing this for a very long time/ You can tell by the way he acted towards us - friendly and courteous. I would've been just fine with him as our server  but his shift was about to end and instead we got a newcomer. I'm not denouncing them  but I'm sure the more experienced ones have been through all sorts of craziness. At this point  I'm just going on a rant  but it really makes me think twice about planning another outing to BJ's again - at least to this location.,2.16,2.34,2.552,2.056,2.268
575,Addy Y.,San Francisco  CA,420,53,148.0,2014-01-07,2.0,It was an alright experience. I don't think it was worth our wait nor the cost of food.We waited over 2 hours for a table for 8. Yes  my friend didn't make reservations prior  but I think it's reasonable to let your customers know you can't sit there forever.After quite some wait for the waiter to come around with water  then to take our orders  I asked for the BlueHouse cheeseburger w/ wedge-cut fries. The fries were good  but the burger was nothing special nor worth the $9-10. It was just a bit over the size of an In-N-Out burger  and the meat was dry and flavorless. My friends ordered some drinks  and the cider was fruity  fizzy  and you can hardly taste the alcohol (I'm not saying this is a bad thing  though!)Regarding the service  some of my friends ordered thin-cut fries but received fries that were wedge-cut. The waiter informed us after we all received our dishes that they had ran out of thin-cut fries. I know this may not seem like a big deal  but customer service-oriented workers would make sure that their clients knew what they would be paying for beforehand. I  for a fact  would've ordered a salad if they ran out of wedge-cut fries.We were celebrating my friend's birthday  so we ordered a 3-set mini pizooki platter: red velvet  double chocolate  and white macadamia (not sure of the actual dish names). The dessert took a while to arrive  but eventually  out of the corner of my eye  our waitress seems to walk in slo-mo as she delivers our pizooki topped with ... half-melted vanilla ice cream. This was the most disheartening part of the night for me. I've been to BJ's before and I was never served dripping  melted  sad ice cream. Considering that the double chocolate cookie was very yummy  its presentation was a huge disappointment.Also  my friend ordered a pasta dish and got food poisoning the next morning.,2.2,2.32,2.548,2.024,2.2720000000000002
1151,Jorlyn W.,Daly City  CA,200,51,12.0,2014-01-08,2.0,This place is decent. Over priced food  medium sized portions. Called in to put our name down and they told us 20 minutes got there in 10 and if was an extra 30 to see down. Besides that we got seated at a huge boot it was a bit awkward but it's ok. We ordered the shrimp scampi? BBQ chicken salad  and I must say the salad was really good and the scampi I would definitely pass on that.. Strawberry lemonade that my gf ordered was a bit too sweet so I wouldn't recommend ordering it. Service was a bit difficult  our server said they were understaffed  I appreciate the honesty but it sure didn't look like they were under staffed lol  they had people talking and walking around laughing. Anyways the bill came out it was almost 50$ for 2 drinks and 2 entrees.... Wasn't really worth the amount of $ we spent. I'm sure we'll be back to give it another shot. The pazookie is definitely something to get I just didn't get it this time,2.24,2.33,2.54,2.12,2.2940000000000005
945,Valerie N.,San Francisco  CA,8,37,4.0,2014-01-13,1.0,Do not want to get into the specifics but if you have a card and your friends are paying cash  check your account. Asides from that food was cold and service was not up to par.,2.12,2.32,2.524,2.052,2.24
972,Jay Y.,San Francisco  CA,38,15,2.0,2014-01-15,2.0,They get 2 stars only because the manager or supervisor did accommodate us when we complained the poor service. I come here a lot  often with friends to watch sports. That's when Buffalo Wild Wings is jammed pack. But Bj's service is horrible. I remember calling in just to reduce my wait time upon arrival and the rep stated that it would only be a 20 minute wait. I ended up waiting an hour and 10 minutes. Not only that  I asked the rep why I was told to wait only 20 minutes and she couldn't even explain. All I wanted was a simple explanation and I was going to move on since my table was ready. But then another girl  the so-called coordinator  butts in  gives me a bad attitude while explaining to me why the wait. She had no idea I had called in ahead of time. And to make matters worse  I was not even being rude or unreasonable to the rep. How disappointing.,2.0,2.33,2.516,2.152,2.1980000000000004
818,Paul O.,San Jose  CA,3,18,,2014-01-17,1.0,"This individual BJ\'s is by far the absolute worst franchised resturant/bar that I have ever been to. If you are the manager  supervisor  or owner of this place - please keep reading this review  and know that you should never EVER think that you are running your business well. EVERY PART OF THE EXPERIENCE AT THIS PLACE WAS HORRIBLE.My girlfriend and I went here just last night  around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. It wasn\'t busy  there was no line waiting for seats  and there were open tables through the resturant. We chose to sit at the bar area  at one of the two-top tall tables  in order to get served a little more rapidly  as well as get drinks quicker. We sat  and sat  and sat  and waited  and watched as many waiters  waitresses  bussers  and pretty much everyone walked by our table. No one said anything to us about being right with us  offering us water  menu\'s  drinks  nothing. Even the bartender  who was not more than four feet away from us  who was staring right at us  NEVER asked us if we needed or wanted anything.It was seriously about 10 mins before our waitress came up to our table with menus - and no I\'m not exaggerating  the basketball game was on  we were watching it  and the full commercial breaks and more game  and more commercials  while waiting for service...When our waitress came she was very nice - this was the ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS RESTURANT.She took our drink order - my girl got some pink cadillac cocktail  and I simply ordered a dirty martini. We also asked for the fried calamari appetizer  and we\'d continue looking at the menu. When the drinks came  I sipped mine and immediately knew that someone screwed it up. I\'m going to tell you something that may come as a shock - a martini is made with GIN... NOT VODKA. If I ordered a vodka martini  then I\'d want vodka in it. When someone orderes a martini - that means GIN. Now  I understand that some people who order drinks may not know that  so it is up to the servers and barkeeps to specify gin or vodka if they think the person ordering it might be too stupid to know what is in a real martini. Also on the martini  a dirty martini means that you add some olive juice to the gin and vermouth as well  not just THREE OLIVES in the glass. (In case you were wondering  yes three olives is excessive for a martini)Now on to the calamari which came shortly after the drinks. They were overly fried (almost burned)  and not seasoned with salt at all. In fact  the breading on it was so bland it made flour look spicy. The two dipping sauces which come with calamari are supposed to be tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Guess what we were given!! MOTHERFUCKING RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE. Let me re-iterate that for you: RANCH AND PIZZA SAUCE INSTEAD OF TARTAR AND COCKTAIL SAUCE.What kind of stupid ass  dumb fucks do you have plating in that kitchen?Next up our meal came. We ordered a buffalo burger and the ahi salad. When we ordered it  we asked for an extra plate so that we could split the two in half and share them. No extra plate came with our food. The dipshit that brought us the food asked us if we needed anything else  I asked for some horseradish dipping sauce  or something similar. He said no problem. He never came back.With no extra plate  I scraped the crap-salad off the plate with the burger onto a different  dirty plate (more on that later)  and we made do with the rest.The burger was mediocre at best. There was very littly ""buffalo"" sauce on the burger  only a sliver of onion on it  and a single leaf of lettuce. The patty looked like a pre-packaged patty that you tear the paper off and slap on the grill when you don\'t care about quality. In all  the burger was sub-par.The salad  which should have been stupid simple was also screwed up. The ahi  which should have had a brief sear on it  was overly seared  though at least seasoned well. What completely ruined this plate was the wasabi paste on it. Now  I can handle spice - and I love wasabi. This shit was so in-edible  that you even put a small bit on the ahi  and you are tearing up. It ruined everything that it touched. Which was awesome  because some bites of sald would not have any on it (which was nice) and others would send me looking for my non-existent water glass.Which  btw  there was no water glass. Oh  and the shit cocktails were empty just after starting the meal. Nice  huh?The kicker of all this  was the dirty ass tables directly next to us. They were piled with trash  and dirty dishes the ENTIRE TIME WE WERE THERE. They didn\'t start bussing them until we were leaving - don\'t forget that this place WAS NOT BUSY! NO EXCUSE FOR THIS.This whole experience only cost me a little over sixty dollars. I\'d like to extend a very healthy FUCK YOU to the management team and owners of this establishment for allowing this kind of stupidity and complete lack of service that we got. I hope you loose money  and go out of business.",1.96,2.32,2.5,2.02,2.176
447,Liz D.,La Riviera  CA,110,410,40.0,2014-01-19,4.0,Every time I come to BJ's sit at the bar. It's more entertaining. Keith is ALWAYS awesome. My sister and know him on a first name basis. He's super friendly. I see how he introduces himself to customers. Dante is also super. I thought Dante was a bartender  he's not. He's working to get promoted to waiter. He should be  he's ready. Very friendly and helpful. It's the great service that keeps me coming back at BJ's. I do wish they offered more vegetarian options such as a portobello or a roasted vegetable sandwich. I usually ordered appetizers that have no meat. Also I love the Grand Cru beer. It's their seasonal beer and it becomes permanent. It's super delicious.,2.04,2.34,2.512,2.512,2.2199999999999998
927,Dessert F.,San Jose  CA,2,14,,2014-01-19,1.0,Recently moved to the area and went to BJs a few times within the first month. Our dine in experiences were pretty good but takeout experiences have been terrible!! Food for two people took a full hour longer than quoted over the phone. Order was incomplete for 30 minutes while they waited for a side of steamed veggies. Staff were polite but were clearly overwhelmed because the 3 orders around me were also incorrect. It appears communication between the staff is lacking and all they offered me was a soda while I waited. And that came after I'd been standing there for a hour beyond the expected pickup time. We'll eat at any of the other local restaurants before returning. Oh and avoid the berry cobbler. It looks and tastes like it came from an easy bake oven.

I would have said something but it already took 45 minutes to arrive so I figured it wasn't worth it.I ordered soup  but it arrived about 5 minutes before my entreeThey should take one of the dozens of floor staff members and put a few more in food prep.,1.92,2.33,2.504,2.116,2.1660000000000004

248,Jerianne G.,Daly City  CA,1354,374,701.0,2014-01-27,3.0,"I\'m rather surprised that I haven\'t made an actual review for this place  I\'ve been here a couple of times already.This place is basically like Elephant bar. Its family friendly  and its adult friendly  since there\'s a bar there also. The lighting here has always been dim  so be orepared to squint while reading the menu. The menu varies from pizzas  pastas  and sandwiches  to seafood  light food  and desserts. This place also has several ""customize yourself"" items.When this place first opened up  it really was something big. Over the years  their quality of food sorta went down in a slow descent. They added the ""small snacks"" portion  but some of these snacks do not fit the description of ""small snack"". They\'ve also increased the prices for many of their entrees  but the portions are always smaller than the price you pay for. Some recent additions that have been made are the additional tables outside the restaurant and inside the mall. More seats = more people accommodated = better business.Service here is amazingly slow. I understand that it gets way busy on weekends  but sometimes people who come here after you will end up getting their food before you. Some waiters here work well  while others don\'t. There was an instance where my family and I had waited about 30-40 mins for our food  and when they brought it to our table  they just slid the plates across the table rather than gently pass them to us. They didn\'t even have the nerve to apologize  they just walked off afterwards. I get that people have off days  but you chose to work at a restaurant that gets busy. If you can\'t work well under pressure  then throw in the towel and get another job.Some foods here are definitely not worth the price. Back then  their presentation of foods were on point. But over the years  that has changed. Their pastas sound so good through the description  but when they come out  they look like something anyone can cook within their own homes. I\'m not down to pay $15 just to eat pasta that looks like it was splashed in sauce and dumped on the plate. Recently  I waited for a California chicken sandwich and when it came out  it was just a basic sandwich with fries. Did I really just wait 30 minutes for a simple sandwich that I could\'ve made myself? That and the chicken was burnt also  it tasted like charcoal.Big ups though for the pizookies and other desserts. This is a place I would prefer to seldom go rather than be a regular.",1.76,2.3,2.496,2.38,2.084

We ordered cheeseburgers  figuring that they'd be fast. 20 minutes later  still no food. The waitress walks by and apologizes for the wait. 20 more minutes pass  people that showed up well after us got their food.

866,Jessica M.,San Francisco  CA,48,121,288.0,2014-02-03,4.0,Saturday night around 7pm...Talk about lucky. People were standing out in the mall  spilling outside the doors and impatiently waiting in the front of the restaurant staring at the hostess'. I walked right in  scoped the bar with the high cocktail tables and waited like a buzzard for a couple I saw paying their bill. 4 minutes later I was sitting down..ahhh...Larissa was our waitress..and was very busy but being a former waitress and also previously working for a BJ's I gave it an extended amt of time from the required 2 minute greeting. Had something different than I normally would. Typically the apps and pizza's are the homerun but we saw a salad on the table next to ours and wanted to eat it  so we ordered our own. Except it came out completely bare. Just tomatoes  it was weird. I mean I just ordered it straight off the menu so I guess it was the expeditors fault for not looking at what they were grabbing off the line. So I was patient  it's very important to be patient! =)So it came back with a few more ingredients but still not as the menu has it being prepared. It was a bummer but after mentioning it to Larissa she quickly explained it to the manager who then quickly came to our table to express his apologies for the mix-up. When we rc'vd the bill the salad was taken off. They didn't mention it  just did it. So that was nice and appreciated!!I didn't get a POOZKIE but have many other nights and shifts but ya gotta if you like warm cookies..it's simply sinful.,2.0,2.35,2.488,2.416,2.2100000000000004

When we walked in we saw it was packed so we went to the hostess and asked if she had a table for two. She said she can sit us immediately so we got seated and waited for a waiter or waitress to address us. After 30 mins no one came to our table so we left and went to Red Robins instead. The most annoying part was the other tables around us got their food and the servers saw us but just kept on walking. Talk about crapoy customer service  im going to think twice before coming here ever again.,1.92,2.35,2.484,2.116,2.1780000000000004
1208,R L.,Millbrae  CA,0,13,2.0,2014-02-08,2.0,I'm giving this a 2 star primarily because of their front of the house hosts. We did a 'call ahead' for 2 people to avoid waiting since there was a 15 minutes wait. When we got there 15 minutes later  they told us it's another 10-15 minutes. 10 minutes later  I asked how many more people ahead of us. I was told we would be next and to just wait until the pager go off. We watch 6 more groups of 2 go  finally 15 minutes later we were called.  So lessons learned  just get there  get a pager an wait. Don't bother calling. The front hosts are rude and unorganized.,1.84,2.34,2.48,2.3120000000000003,2.14

794,Elle N.,San Francisco  CA,25,12,,2014-02-12,2.0,The boyfriend and I decided to come here since we haven't been here in awhile. Was seated really fast  and food came out within 10 minutes. Why the 2 stars? 1 star for bring seated quickly  1 star for the quickness of the food coming out. We waited about 30 minutes to get the check and maybe order dessert. I was planning on getting the pizookie but I guess I'm not. So many waiters have come and gone and not one of them asks us if we want the bill or if we want to order dessert. We saw many of the other waiters check up on their tables but we were totally ignored. We didn't even know where our waiter went. We've definitely had better service before. Would we come back? Don't know... Poor service.,2.0,2.37,2.488,2.3120000000000003,2.2220000000000004
888,S B.,San Francisco  CA,7,89,6.0,2014-02-14,1.0,Mediocre take on the classic brewhouse. Menu items are boring and tired. The place is in a mall and often busy but dont let that fool you. Its main competition to the captive audience is a mall food court.,2.0,2.34,2.476,2.18,2.2039999999999997
561,Cheryl M.,San Francisco  CA,99,11,2.0,2014-02-16,2.0,* wrote this review at the restaurant as it happened- host told us it was a 20 min wait for two people. After about 35 mins  we decided to go inside to ask how much longer. They messed up and said the reason why it took longer is because they put us down for four. Uh doesn't make sense.- got seated outside (area by Barnes and Noble) at a table that's seriously hidden which also didn't make sense because there were two booths open. When the host brought us to our table  we saw that there were still plates and cups.- waited about 15 mins for our server.- complained about how there was something in my water and got no apology.- all the workers that came to our table were impolite Literally 5 mins after we got our food we decided to just take the food to go. The stars are for the food..and how much tip I left. Ha!,1.96,2.32,2.472,2.2800000000000002,2.176
971,Jerry P.,Daly City  CA,4,15,2.0,2014-02-18,5.0,Since I fairly watch my diet  everytime I step into a restaurant the first thing I check is their salad then appetizers. I just love their seared ahi tuna salad  soup and strawberry lemonade. Plus  my 20-month-old daughter is always in a good mood throughout our meal. We feed her with the kiddie meal while she enjoys her coloring book. Will definitely come back.....,2.12,2.34,2.472,2.612,2.252

256,Jack R.,San Francisco  CA,1874,1134,1271.0,2014-02-26,2.0,"I think my friend should have her own reality Tv show. Something that\'s a mix between The Real Housewives of San Francisco and The San Francisco Mafia Wives.She\'s tough  and when she says ""I\'ll cut you "" you best believe she means it.And though I haven\'t seen it  I\'m sure she carries a machete  chainsaw  and some Rocky and Bullwinkle bombs in her purse.So when she says she likes coming here  I\'m not going to disagree with her. At least  not to her face.We used to work together  and are here to catch up.She orders beer  and I order an ahi tuna appetizer  and spicy buffalo wings. I wanted to order the rootbeer float  but when I ask the waiter how much the rootbeer float would be as opposed to a regular rootbeer he says he doesn\'t know. And since he took away our menus awhile ago  and since I don\'t want a rootbeer float that badly  I\'m not going to fight with him. But when she starts asking him about what kind of vodka they have at the bar  and if he can make this or that drink  and he says ""I don\'t know "" I began to shake my head. I hoped he would see it. It was my way of warning him that he better run and get those drinks she wanted  and quick too. You don\'t want to get on her bad side  I tried to convey to him telepathically  as I looked at him  and back at the bar. Hinting that that\'s where he should be. Not here  answering ""I don\'t know"" to what drinks they can and can\'t do.Fortunately  he lived to bring out my appetizers  the tuna had no flavor  and the buffalo wings tasted like Tabasco sauce. Both mediocre. Like the service. But  unlike him  I\'m not going to say a word.

A little over 20 minutes went by so I asked and they said we'd have to wait another 20 minutes. After waiting and waiting over 20 min. I asked how long and they said 15 minutes. A party of 6 of us decided to leave. It's too bad you couldn't stick to your words. Never coming back  this was ridiculous.,2.44,2.32,2.496,1.8600000000000003,2.368

Now  I had been here before and had a great experience  however  this time it was not what I would expect. The staff sat us down  at first the server was great  he then had to take off for lunch so we were introduced to another server. This new server was bad. He ignored us for 15 minutes  until one of my co-workers got up to call him to our table. Before the food arrived  we  once again  tried to get his attention for drinks-- no luck. Once again  my co-worker gets up--success  drinks. After we finished our meals  we lingered and chatted. We asked for dessert menu  no luck. (How rude!?) Finally  my manager had had it! she asked for bill...it took about 15 minutes to get it. She was fed up  got up  and asked him for amount. He gave it to her  with a snarky attitude  she gave him exact change and we left. We did not even bother speaking with manager.

653,Char N.,Portland  OR,27,15,1.0,2014-03-10,5.0,I love BJ's. It is what it is  which is a restaurant in a mall  so it is inevitably busy during rush hours and full of people I'd rather have nothing to do with  but for what it is  I adore it.I visit San Bruno frequently  and I eat at BJ's every time  because it is close to where I stay. And there are four great things going for this restaurant:-Despite being busy and having a large staff  a few members always recognize me and have a few words to say. (Chris is one waiter who always stops for a word  since I met him on his first shift.)-They have a large selection of good  imported beers  which I like  since I am a fan of Belgian-style beers--saisons and trips  etc.-Whenever they have been out of a bottled beer I have ordered  a manager comes to apologize and is more than eager to make sure I'm %110 happy.-The tortilla soup  oh my god  the tortilla soup. I could eat it every day and still crave it.Over all  this is a great place to eat  if you realize it is a high-volume  busy establishment during peak hours for lunch and dinner. I work in the industry so I get it and I am not annoyed when I have to wait  especially because the staff is seemingly so genuinely friendly  and will remember you and what you like.,2.52,2.35,2.492,2.196,2.418
616,Azinda M.,Chicago  IL,28,287,8.0,2014-03-14,2.0,I usually love BJs  and their food is great  so no problems there. I recommend their spicy tomato pasta  tacos  any of their pizzas  and especially their pizookies-- YUM. My favorite is the Oreo  but they're all good--definitely get one if you're here.As for the service  it was HORRIBLE the last time I went. They took 10-15 minutes just to get us water!!! That's absolutely ridiculous  in my opinion. I couldn't believe how bad that was. Not only that  after they took our order (2 appetizers and a pizookie)  we waited another hour for our food to show up. Horrible horrible service. Go here if you don't mind using the wait to chat with your friends or family  but definitely not if you're in a rush.,2.64,2.31,2.484,1.8,2.442
871,Cupcake 1.,San Francisco  CA,2,77,14.0,2014-03-14,3.0,I absolutely love this restaurant  the only problem is that the staff sucks. They are literally a hot mess and do not know customer service. We went here a month ago and we have a 5 and a half month old  they made us wait an hour and a half!!!!! Their excuse was because the baby chair is a safety hazard!!!!! That's ridiculous I could of put her seat in the booth next to me! Anyways we spoke with the manager and he gave us our meals for free due to the inconvenience!

Once my order came it was very incorrect. I took it anyway but the decided to come back to return it after taking a peak at it in my car. When I told the takeout server I didn't want it and could the remake the correct order  she said yes and I had to wait an additional 30mins. While waiting I overheard other dissatisfied takeout customers and the server repeatedly apologizing.,2.56,2.3,2.472,1.7000000000000002,2.404
1490,Scott C.,San Diego  CA,0,8,,2014-03-14,1.0,I think this is the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. It was over 30 minutes before I had a drink in front of me. After the food was served we had to ask for silverware and plates after the food was served. We had to go to the bar to order the second round of drinks. A third round of drinks was never offered at the table. While watching college basketball the tv spontaneously changed to another channel. At one point 7 of 10 TVs showed the Minnesota vs Michigan hockey game  none were playing the local Sharks game. The food came to the table and then turned around because they didn't have a table stand for the pizza. The second round of chips and salsa we asked for never arrived. I would have liked a third drink and it was never even offered. My water was never refilled. I will not ever return to this location and can't imagine I would ever trust another BJ's. Next time I'll go to Applebee's or something  and I can't eat anything on that menu.,2.52,2.33,2.492,1.6680000000000001,2.406

917,Donna R.,San Francisco  CA,0,59,,2014-03-20,1.0,This is a bar  not really a restaurant. It's really hard to mess up a burger  but they managed. Overcooked  way too salty and not anything like what is described on the menu: no onions  no special bun  etc. etc. I couldn't even finish it.

The service is extremely slow and somethings they will even forget you was sitting there waiting for the plate. Secondly  the food was just ok. They are over the salty side a little (it may be great for drunky). The salad that I ordered have way too many toritos chip instead of lettuce. It made me wonder am I really eating salad or what. The soda that you can get there is like water  totally not carbonated.,2.52,2.28,2.48,1.7000000000000002,2.376

I love that they offer a low calorie menu for those days you just want to eat lite. Our waiter was great  he was very attentive. We were seated right away. I've been here many times and it's usually a good experience. On warm days I love sitting on the patio which is first come first serve. The bar areas fun too. But crowded. Lotsa TV's and music playing. I like it here.,2.52,2.31,2.48,2.032,2.394
384,Elizabeth S.,San Carlos  CA,332,765,335.0,2014-03-23,4.0,This place has pretty damn good American fare with a page numbered menu. -quite a novel here! There is literally something for everyone  and you can have some good beers or interesting beer concoctions with your meal. I tried the Irish Berry Burst with the Berry Cider and Guiness. It was kind of sweet yet refreshing. -probably not for guys though. My bf hated it.Honesty  all the food we ordered was great. They have a plethora of enticing appetizers. So we did it tapas style and feasted with a menu on the side in case we were hungry for more. The Thai shrimp wraps were about as Thai as the lemongrass included but really scrumptious all wrapped in butter lettuce with a sweet soy sauce to dip in.The stuffed mushrooms... We inhaled them!The Santa Fe spring rolls were filled with chicken  black bean  red peppers and other fresh ingredients resulting in nuances of flavors. They also came with two delectable dipping sauces. That avocado one and some sort of spicy aoli were so good  we were dipping the fried artichoke hearts in there too.All this was not enough  so the bf ordered a cup of chili and me the minestrone. What a way to end a fun meal. The chili was robust and flavorful. My minestrone totally exceeded my expectations with the loaded vegetables  kidney beans and some fusilli. It came with some parmesan to sprinkle on top too.This place is super big and lofty. It has a fun atmosphere with tons of TV's  festive beer motifs and some ornate accessories like fancy mirrors and chandeliers. The murals on the wall are great too. This was our first time at this location  but our server was great. I wish I knew his name  but he was an older bald Asian guy with glasses. -very attentive  personable and solicitious. He got me to sign up for a rewards card and explained the point system. All this great service and knowledge with a joking personality to go with! You bet we'll be back!,2.64,2.34,2.484,2.032,2.46
607,Brandon N.,Redwood City  CA,165,158,10.0,2014-03-24,3.0,Had lunch here today and was greeted by a nice host and waiter. Our table had a slightly peculiar odor surrounding it  but it didnt bother me and my party enough to ask for a move. Had the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. Caesar salad had a few pieces of limp lettuce  so I didnt ask for 2nds. 1st bowl was the clam chowder. It was one of the better soups at BJs. Pretty good amount of some good-size clams and creamy but not overly creamy soup. Next was tortilla soup. At first  they give you a dry bowl of tortilla chips  avocado and lime. Then they have a secondary container where the pour from to combine the soup with the dry ingredients  right at the table. Pretty cool from a presentation standpoint. Tortilla soup was overly salty but good. Last up was the chili. I didn't have any  but my friend reported that it had an ale flavor about it. Not my cup of tea so i passed.2 stars for the food  extra star for the employees.,2.68,2.36,2.48,1.9320000000000002,2.488

I plan to go back this month thanks to the owners comment.The food is always ok but not astounding. I don\'t really come here to dine. I come here to meet friends for a drink. My girlfriend and I met up for some appetizers and drinks. We had the following appetizers with the Root Beer drink with alcohol in it:Artichoke - they were okFried Calamari - it was just like any otherAvocado Egg Rolls - did not look anything like the picture. i\'ve had them before and they were pretty good. these ones were like pink and super spicy. did someone change the recipe to hot egg rolls with hidden avocado and not update the menu? no likey.Chicken Lettuce Wraps - these were the best. They were really good.The drinks were really good...when you could get them. While our waitress was nice she was mostly absent. I don\'t know if they were super busy (didn\'t look like it). We literally had to flag our waitress down for more drinks  water  water refills and she was short with us when we ordered dessert. We were both wondering what she was going to bring to the table as we both ordered the same thing and she started to walk away saying ""ok one of each"". We were like wuh? She didn\'t make eye contact with us when walking by our table. Thank goodness my friend was loud when she said ""excuse me"". We were there for over two hours. In her defense  we were talking and visiting so I can see why she didn\'t want to ""bug"" us but it was pretty bad still. It won\'t stop us from going back because we do get something out of it but I don\'t go for service or food really.

We used to be regulars until we went there a few months back and had a horrible experience. Since we come quite often I know what their food should taste like. Our pizza was somewhat burned and after feeding the kids a slice each  I realized it was off. I lifted the toppings and sure enough the top of the pizza dough was slightly burned. No big deal  asked our waitress for another and she was totally cool with it. She went and told her manager and that\'s when the horrible experience started. I believe his name was Tracy  middle aged guy seemed like he was tweaked out on something. He came over very aggressively and said ""so what\'s the problem with your pizza"". I said it was slightly burned and that we wanted another one that wasn\'t. He walked away almost like he was pissed off at us. My husband sensed it right away but I told him no way  that\'s probably his personality--he is a manager after all so there was no way he would treat a customer rudely. After maybe 15 mins our new pizza came out and was much better. Tracey came back and asked how our pizza was (and for that split second I thought  ok cool we were just trippin about his rudeness) and when we said much better he proceeded to say ""ok  it looks the same to me. Let me know if you need anything else"". Are you serious?! Why would I make my starving kids wait for a whole new pizza when there was nothing wrong with it? I was NOT asking for a free one  I just wanted a non-burnt one that I was paying full price for. Total jerk  def on something. Sorry BJs but how do you hire people like that let alone make them managers?! Will not be visiting ANY BJ restaurants because of this experience.

The food isn't AMAZING but it's pretty consistent  but it's pretty darn good.Get the stuffed mushrooms  and try the lettuce wraps with shrimp. Delicious. Also  deep dish pizza anyone? They are so great. I've tried the bbq chicken  and vegetarian. Deep dish is so delicious. They also have great flatbread appetizers (California club).Their happy hours are at random times (I think even at 10pm on some days)  but they have great drink specials. Some of their drinks are strong. They have skinny margaritas as well. Woo! Fun place but it gets super duper crowded. Sitting at the bar  you don't have to wait as long but those seats fill up fast. Expect to wait from 30 min to an hour.,2.4,2.32,2.468,2.2239999999999998,2.352
522,Crystal C.,San Francisco  CA,563,454,87.0,2014-04-04,2.0,I have such mixed feelings for BJ's that I had to give it only two stars. While they do offer a nice location (right at the end of the mall) and plenty of booths  TVs  indoor/outdoor seating  I just never get a good vibe or hot food when I dine there.The servers are always nice  but regularly switch shifts in the middle of our meal. I don't need to get to know you  or your co-worker  this isn't fine dining. But ok  they are friendly  espcially when I've gone in with my BFF and her baby  everyone dotes on her  offers baby-appropriate snacks  etc. but the hosts/hotesses could use an attitidue adjustment. Um  I'm sorry  am I inconveniencing you by asking to be seated while you're working? Is that not your job? Have you ever heard of smiling/greeting customers?We have ordered the Flatbread Pizzas  but they have never really been hot and the flavors are just kind of... bleh. I had the clam chowder followed by a Pazzuci (sp?) that I shared with two friends which gave me an awful feeling and caused me to be sick when I got home. I have also tried the Halibut fish tacos and they were bland.I think it really depends on what you order. When BFF got the baby a chicken tenders with fries meal  baby mushed up the fries  we ate the tenders which were really hot and yummy  but that's such a basic item that anyone could get right. I will say that I like their Cider/Heff beer cocktail. Overall  there are plenty of other places to eat  like the food court or 5 Guys which appeal to me much more.,2.44,2.33,2.472,2.024,2.374

The pizza was raw! Looked done so we eat a slice wondering -is this what it's supposed to taste like? Wasn't sure but no one was around to say anything so I continued eating. We let the waiter know who happily took it away. The pizza got comped but I'm left with a crazy stomach ache. Wish I could take it all back!!

Food is no different from any other chain eatery. Had reservations for 6 pm finally got seated at 6:45! We had a party of 5 and requested a booth in the outside mall area be cause it was quieter. We were willing to wait a bit. But as we were waiting for the staff to get our menus another staff person walked past our party and seated 2 people in a large both. All they could do was say sorry and told us had to wait for another booth to open. We ended sitting in the noisey area. No attempt was made to make us feel as we were important. Never going there again. Just let the children have it.,2.2,2.31,2.444,1.988,2.2660000000000005
727,Eric L.,Daly City  CA,1,19,,2014-04-14,1.0,"First of all if you have any hopes of getting seated inside be prepared to have to wait 45+ minutes just to be seated. On this occasion we were forced to sit outside on the patio. Upon sitting down on this chilly day  we realized the outdoor heaters were not turned on so we asked our waitress if she could turn them on for us & she quickly mentioned she would get her manager. This alone struck me off guard since she worked there and should know how to function the heaters on her own for the customers. I did not want to make a scene to require the manager to personally attend to us for something that could have and should have been done by the server. After finally getting our heater fixed  we ordered our drinks & either the waitress was new or didn\'t know her stuff but she kept telling us certain things were not on the happy hour menu when we were reading right off of it. I know it may be a lot to remember but certainly something that should be able to grasp after a while. STRIKE 1After finally ordering our drinks  we had to wait a solid 10-15 minutes before getting them served to us which was horrible. The foam on my beer was gone and the evaporation on the glass showed that my beer had been poured a while ago & was sitting on the counter not being delivered to us. Upon receiving my beer  I noticed a little spec of dirt near the top which I had to fork out. At this point  I was pretty dissatisfied but still determined to make this a good experience for my girlfriend & I so I ignored it & drank the beer anyways. I took a sip of the beer and thanks to the combination of the horrible pour by the bartender and the slow delivery by the server  one small sip equated to nearly an inch of the beer in my glass gone! Ridiculous! It seemed that the servers there were all inexperienced. Every time one of our dishes was on its way to come out to us  it was as if the server was playing a guessing game. They would go up to two tables before finally figuring out it was our dish. I mean how hard could it be to deliver the food the appropriate table number? This is just plain inexcusable  get it together! STRIKE 2One of the only reasons I decided to go back to this restaurant after my first awful experience of getting cold food was the fact that I had purchased a fundraiser card from our local little league team. Once our ""stellar"" waitress came back to drop off the bill  it turned out she brought us out someone else\'s bill with OUR discount applied to it. After waiting another 5-10 minutes to flag her down & let her know that she had made a mistake  we finally got the right bill.  Our bill came out to $31 & I reluctantly handed over my credit card to escape this hell hole. Upon getting my card back I realize that I was charged for $33 dollars instead of the $31 that was on the tab previously. WHAT TYPE OF RESTAURANT CHANGES A BILLS TOTAL AFTER THE FACT? STRIKE 3.My girlfriend thought it was ridiculous & suggested to simply not leave a tip  but I didn\'t want to be rude. I flagged my waitress down & mentioned it to her & she seemed to have already known of the problem. If she knew  why hadn\'t she mentioned it to me!? Apparently the machine was having trouble honoring my discount and ended up charging me the full amount  which would have been nice to know. Upon the managers arrival he said their machines have been messing up and such. I did not want to hear this after the fact of my card being charged an amount I hadn\'t agreed to. You could tell some of the managers buddies were also in the patio area since he was raising his voice & making a scene out of it. I did not want to look like the petty guy complaining over a couple dollars but that is exactly what he tried to make me look like. I was arguing more over the principle of what had happened. Instead of being relaxed and care free  I was being annoyed. He mentioned  ""oh you want me to log the $1.70 discount? I mean I can easily do that if it will make you happy"" & he chuckled and said it in a way to belittle me in front of his friends. I eventually started ignoring what he had to say as he didn\'t seem to get what I was arguing over & I wouldn\'t be surprised if he was under the influence as well.  I still ended up giving the waitress her tip & paid the tab (without my discount) just so I could leave and not have bad karma laying over me. To sum it up  the wait staff is inexperienced  the servers are incompetent & the managers are unprofessional.  The only thing worth anything at this place are the pazookie\'s which if I ever get the urge to have one it certainly won\'t be from here. I will gladly drive the extra 30+ miles just to not have to ever lay foot in this specific location ever again.",2.2,2.31,2.444,2.02,2.2660000000000005

After we got the menu the server said he will b right back 10 min pass no one came back we have to look for our server I guess they r in a rush to get off work and don't wanna serve..the manager here really need to retain all their staff....this is the worst customer service restaurant I ever been too and I would never come back for sure,2.12,2.3,2.436,2.052,2.2279999999999998

I had a server with me and my boyfriend who was giving attitude and for some reason all those servers think too highly of themselves. I used to come here all the time because it's a sports bar and cool hang out spot  but I'm cool of the waiters if they are going to serve and give me attitude.,2.0,2.31,2.432,2.152,2.1860000000000004
555,Regina D.,Los Angeles  CA,113,9,,2014-04-19,2.0,I have never been very impressed by this location but my visit last night was the cherry on the top. To start off  our waitress smelled like she had just been chain smoking right before she came to our table. The bathroom smelled like there was some sort of sewer leakage and the garbage was over flowing. Every single stall was dirty/out of toilet paper. I used the only clean stall but I had to go find my own toilet paper to bring in with me. The bathroom looked like no one had cleaned it at all the entire day. We ordered the potato skins which were actually very good (and the only reason that I'm giving the restaurant 2 stars)The pazookie was over cookedOverall it was not a pleasant experience and from now on I'll just be going to the BJ's at Bridgepoint,2.04,2.29,2.432,2.152,2.1900000000000004
502,Johnny G.,San Francisco  CA,288,214,38.0,2014-04-21,1.0,"Everytime I come to BJ\'s  it\'s a disappointment. The wait for a table here is outrageous.Honestly  if you want a place to kick it with friends over beer and food  BJ\'s would be the ideal place right? This place looks great based on their menu but their service is SLOW and the wait here is stupid LONG. My friend got here at 7PM on a Thursday night to grab a table for 7. Keep in mind that it\'s Thursday night and the tables weren\'t even filled. I arrived at 7:45 PM  45 minutes after my friend already put his name down for a table. As soon as I arrive  I asked the lady in the front how much longer and she said 15 mins. So I sit back down and wait patiently. 20 minutes later  I ask her again and she tells me another 15-20 mins. Ok...you said that 20 minutes ago and we already waited a little over an hour. How about you give us an accurate time? 20 minutes later  I ask her AGAIN and she tells me they\'re ""setting"" up the table. Long story longer  we waited damn near 2 hours for a table here. My friend got here at 7PM and we didn\'t even get seated til damn near 9PM. Funny thing is they decide to open up the back tables after WE were seated. They had a bunch of OPEN seats in the back.There are definitely BETTER places to go for dinner/beer with your buddies. THUMBS DOWN for BJ\'s.",1.96,2.29,2.424,2.116,2.1580000000000004

540,P. C.,San Francisco  CA,10,52,3.0,2014-04-27,2.0,If I was rating the food  it would get 5 stars!!I continuously come back here to see if their service would change for the better but sadly it's still the same. I even decided to come at a not so busy time too. The hostesses care more about talking about their personal lives and other co workers than they do their customers. That is not ok with me. Being seated towards the middle area  I notice it's always a social gathering spot for the waiters/waitresses to hang out and make fun of customers. I CAN HEAR YOU!!! I really hope management steps up and properly trains their staff more! Your food is so good!!!! Get the staff to match it!!!,2.0,2.25,2.412,2.2800000000000002,2.1500000000000004
266,Cindy G.,Hamilton  Canada,119,133,538.0,2014-04-27,3.0,I've been to this location three times and the only word I can say is: SLOW.The first and second time dine in during lunch and it took forever to get our appetizer and then the entree. I would say a good 20 minute for our food to arrive. But wasn't satisfied with the service and the food was blend. The third time is for happy hour  again it was slow and waited for 5 minutes until this one server greeted and apologized the long wait. But the drinks came in less then 5 minutes and the food  for a good 7-8 minutes. I order the wildberry mojito for $4.00 and it was pretty good. Then the food: first the California club flatbread was good and crispy with various of toppings that is healthy but good. Then chicken potsticker are really delicious along with the avocado roll that has a kick of flavor but at least my friend and I had a pretty good dinner. Then the mini pizooki  I order the cookies and creme pizooki while my friend order the chocolate ghirardelli pizzoki which she said it was moist and sweet. As for the cookies n creme  very creamy and sugary. I would come back but only for happy hour since there is no chance that I'll dine in unless there training the server to be quick.,2.04,2.27,2.412,2.412,2.1780000000000004
855,Frances T.,South San Francisco  CA,2,5,5.0,2014-04-29,1.0,So it was my birthday with friends and our food was freshly served  like you can see the steam from the pizza and everything. But waiter forgot our spare plates  so we waited like 10 minutes for them  thinking that we would get clean  newly washed plates. NO WRONG. We were served forks with chunks of spare food on it  plates with ketchup and mustard on it  and napkins that had stains on it. Let me add  it was not a busy day. Service was slow and the pizza was way too oily almost as if they drenched it and made it soggy.,1.92,2.24,2.396,2.148,2.112
840,Samantha M.,San Francisco  CA,457,55,52.0,2014-04-29,4.0,I really like the food & beer/ drink selection. If you're hungry & in a hurry don't come here though. Unless you're lucky to snag a seat by the bar  the wait is usually long. Both for a table & for the service. The staff is generally friendly though so that makes up for some of it  & the food & drink options make up for the rest of it. If you work up an appetite shopping or want to snag a happy hour at the mall  it's a good option. I usually just get an appetizer & a drink or two. Wines  beer  martinis  all good options.,2.04,2.27,2.4,2.48,2.1780000000000004
749,Raeann L.,San Jose  CA,66,3,,2014-04-29,2.0,The service here is HORRIBLE. First of all  the whole time we were here  we were not offered any water or given any water. I understand that we went during a playoff game and it gets super busy but that is no excuse for good customer service. Second of all  they had a shortage of glasses and pitchers and asked us to chug our beers so they could use our glasses. Although I agree that beers should be chugged and not sitting on the table waiting to be consumed  it's kind of rude to ask us to drink all our beers so you could use our glasses. If a customer wants to take their time with their drink  then allow them to do so. It's not our faults that you aren't prepared enough to provide glasses for customers to drink their beers especially since this is a popular place that allows customers to watch sports especially during big NBA playoff games with a Bay Area team playing. Oh and did I mention that another server came to our table and told us to pour the rest of what's in the pitcher into our glasses. Third of all  the server we had was not nice at all. She never came to our table and asked if we needed anything else or if we were doing okay. When we asked for a beer menu she kept walking away as she agreed to get it for us. And then just dropped it off at our table without acknowledging us or being polite about it. AND all of a sudden we had a different waitress. Nobody informed us whether the first server we had was going on a break or not. We had to find out by seeing her picking at her teeth with her finger nails. Fourth and foremost  they took away my salad that I didn't finish. They didn't ask if I was finished or if I wanted to take it home. There was still plenty left to eat and it irks me to know that they took it and didn't even dare to ask me if I was still eating it. One of the worst services I have ever experienced. If it weren't for the pizookies and avocado egg rolls  I would give this place one star.,1.92,2.25,2.408,2.184,2.1180000000000003

(Very little seating at the bar though)I recently came here to order takeout. The waitress was nice enough to stop assisting her tables and took my order  while she was at the register. Took about 20 minutes to get my food though...you need to make sure to tell them your name at the desk and remind them because they forgot to call out my name when the food came. I waited an extra 10 minutes when the food was there the whole time...I guess everybody was busy because the restaurant was packed that night due to the NBA playoffs.Overall  BJs would def be an option for me whenever I am craving pasta!

I've been to this place a few times  and I usually have to wait an average of 10-20 minutes to be seated.- Aside from a few dishes  most of the food is highly processed frozen/pre-made chain food.

Our food took 40 minutes to come and when it did  our entree was not complete AT ALL. We told the server that it wasn't what we ordered and that the picture on the menu didn't match what we got. He was still really slow and had no clue what we were talking about. The calamari was cold and soggy. The food was cold as well. I just wanted to come in at 10:30pm for a late snack after a long day to relax and this happened  resulting in ruining my whole night. Never again will I come here. Educate your servers.

They told me they would not allow a party our size to split our check. This caused issues but none the less we still decided to deal with it. The day off they called and confirmed our party. When we arrived we were seated quickly and they got drinks to us very fast. However it seems like some of their wait staff didnt show up and they seemed like they were short staffed despite that they delivered good service. They didn't rush us on leaving even though the restaurant got filled up and they did allow us to split the checks as apposed to having me pay and then get paid back from my group. Over all this was a very good experience. I would return and highly recommended them.The food was good. Too many items with high amount of calories. They did have alternatives with healthier options.,2.4,2.34,2.436,2.2239999999999998,2.364

When I walked in the music was shouting out of the speakers  fighting for attention with the hockey game and it\'s witty announcers. As I was speaking with the hostess she seemed to be slowly falling asleep so I tapped the counter to wake her up. After some tapping she came around and gave me a buzzer which would notify me when my table was ready for my lovely bride and I to feast on some BJ pizza pie!!45 minutes later we were seated  10 minutes later our waiter came by  he was completely stoned on some of Northern California\'s finest marijuana  we ordered two cocktails which we never received. During our time at the table  we were offered several different dishes that we did not order because we had not ordered yet !Our waiter came by and asked us if there was anything else we needed  I started laughing so hard I almost woke up the hostess! After he took our order he came by and informed us he was leaving and that another waiter would be waiting on us.

499,V W.,Las Vegas  NV,569,601,197.0,2014-05-14,2.0,I really wanted to give BJ'S at least 3 stars  but unfortunately I can't. Here are the two reasons why I'm giving them 2 stars. I came in last weekend with my husband and I ordered an asian salad off the light menu and they got my order wrong twice. I had request no onions or bell peppers in my salad and both times my salad arrived with those items on it. By the third time I was just starving so I ended up picking out all the items off my salad. In all honesty I would have enjoyed my salad if I hadn't spend so much time picking through it.The other thing that made this visit very memorable in a bad way is that a few hours later my husband began to feel queazy and we figured it was the burger he had. He ordered a bison burger done medium well and it was obviously undercooked and or mishandled. My husband spent the entire night vomiting with other symptoms  which only means 1 thing. Food poisoning!!!I'll say that I've been to other BJ's many times and everything was about a 3 star review  but this visit was probably the absolute worst and most likely I will never come back or recommend this place to anyone.My idea of a positive dining experience includes not getting sick. This place is definitely without a doubt 2 thumbs down and if you come here don't say you weren't warned.,2.28,2.29,2.436,2.024,2.286

235,Tara A.,San Francisco  CA,1503,434,1140.0,2014-05-16,3.0,Came here for takeout on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy  but we got our food in around 15 minutes. I was a little irritated though because they got my pizookie order wrong... And I was really excited for the one I got haha (that seems bratty.. oh well). We ordered:Avocado eggrolls: my favorite!! I love them both here and at the Cheesecake Factory. They give you 3 big eggrolls and they are cut in half  so you can definitely share! They come with a sweet tamarind sauce that goes really well with the avocado.Hawaiian mahi mahi: Pretty disappointed in this dish. I think I paid $15 for it and the fish portion definitely did not look like it was worth $15!!! Maybe like... $7 lol. And that's being generous! The fish was also pretty dry and I didn't taste the soy glaze that it said it came with. However  the pineapple fried rice that came with this was delicious and made up for the lack of taste in the fish!Chicken bacon ranch pizza: Cute personal sized pizza. Didn't really taste the ranch so I wish it came with extra ranch for dipping hahahaChoc chip pizookie: Pretty standard  very delicious and soft even after we took it for takeout. We ended up putting it in the toaster oven to heat up and it was perfect! Still had crunchy edges and a soft inside. It was smart of them to give a separate container for the ice cream too. Only downside of this was that I actually ordered cookies and cream!!!!!!! :( Was so disappointed when we saw that it was chocolate chip.... Sigh.... Prob won't get over it until I actually get my cookies and cream pizookie lol.Only 3 stars because I was really disappointed with the fish for that price. All the other food deserves 4 stars!

757,William S.,San Francisco  CA,0,22,2.0,2014-05-19,2.0,My attorney and I were seated just before lunch time. There were many open tables at 11:30 a.m. on a Monday. The hostess seemed to be too preoccupied chatting with the help to notice us at first and left us waiting for about three minutes while she handled some administrative chores. Not a good start.We made THREE requests before and after being seated to TURN DOWN THE MUSIC. Enough Ike and Tina Turner! We couldn't even hear one another. NOTHING was done about the shrieking music even after I asked to speak to the manager (he never showed). The volume and on-going litany of lousy music disrupted our conversation incessantly. The service was 'perfunctory'. The waiter only reappeared once: at the conclusion of the meal to present us a check. Receiving the food on the table took nearly 25 minutes for two hamburgers and fries! Was BJs sending their own livestock out to slaughter first? The burger was LOUSY! It was covered with grill carbon - you know - the carcinogenic 'stuff' you're not supposed to eat. And the meat had one flavor: you guessed it: CARBON. Yuck!

First of have been to this restaurant many many times its either a horrible miss or a awesome hit. It doesn\'t matter my experience should be consistantly good. First of I ordered Pasta with a side wedge Salad. All our food came out at the same time & my Wedge Saled never came. Our waitress totally abandoned us didnt get it till 20 mins after I had to ask again.....Cristal P you stink at your job im sorry. It wasnt just the service that was unpleaent. The pasta lacked quantity for the hefty $15 price tag I paid. The soda didnt taste good. Which is odd cause thier soda is known for being the best. Id recommend Chillis or Maxs instead of Bjs.",2.56,2.26,2.424,1.9600000000000002,2.38

Their happy hour is seriously unbeatable with the best value  and yes  tasty!Only problem is that the service is too slow. Extremely slow. The staff is friendly and I don't understand how they keep a smile when there are so many people complaining about the slow service (like me). Kudos to them for a great attitude.Definitely a nice place to hang  if you're not in a terrible hurry.TIP: You must try the Cheeseburger pizza. It's a concoction of Pizza & Cheese burger - Amazzz.

It was incredibly busy on a week night (and hearing from others  it seems like it\'s packed everyday) and the servers just seemed really unprofessional. They were commenting on other patrons  rolling their eyes and two walked by adjusting their pants.. enough that they should have just done it in a back room / bathroom. Nobody wants to see that while eating  c\'mon.My pasta dish was okay  while the salad was so bland that my vegetarian friend couldn\'t even finish it. We were sure some ingredients had been left off of it. The funniest part was when our Pizookie came. It looked burnt all around the edges  and when my friend tried to spoon some.. she couldn\'t even break through the top crust! We laughed  which attracted the attention of our server  who asked if it was too hard. When we said yes  he said he thought so... then why would he still bring it out? He ended up replacing it with a ""good"" one  no harm done.Overall off experience  but hey.. at least it\'s only once a year! I gotta say though.. a hard Pizookie is a very sad Pizookie!",2.56,2.22,2.416,1.9280000000000002,2.3560000000000003

I was told 20 minute wait; after 30 mins I check with the front desk (she was very snotty today) she informed me that I was only waiting 26 mins not 30 and the tables were not ready. It would be another 10 minutes. After waiting an additional 15 minutes; we asked how much longer and were informed an additional 20-25 minutes. It's not their fault the timing was off. Yet the people that came in after us that were groups of 4 were seated. You really need to remove whoever the short hostess working at btw 6:25 -7:25.

508,Maybo L.,San Francisco  CA,324,159,208.0,2014-06-09,3.0,I guess I should expect a 45 min wait from a restaurant inside the mall  but at least there's a Barnes and Noble right across where you can look around and check out some new books for a bit until your table is ready. Even ended up finding a book I wanted to read and I usually don't have time to read! I ordered a medium rare steak and when it came it seemed as if it was more like medium well. I barely saw any red parts. This was probably due to the chef overcooking it since the waiter knew I ordered a medium rare when I told her it was overcooked and tough. My friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was really good but it had a whopping 1790 calories! One sandwich is almost a whole day's meal worth of calories! Crazy! It didn't seem that fattening though! Service is bad  I got two knives on my steak order with NO forks... I don't think anyone eats steak with their hands. It's not ribs. It was hard to flag down my waiter to ask for a fork  just a bit frustrating when you have waited so long for a table and food and just want to finally eat! Even though the food is mediocre and service doesn't seem to exist  I always end up coming back for their pizookies! Its just so good!,2.52,2.28,2.404,2.0280000000000005,2.376

If there was an option for no-star  that\'s totally what I would put.Here\'s the reference number for the receipt: 0612010000452Feel free to contact me for more details. I hope you all don\'t just ignore your customers on social media.First  let me start off by saying I totally understand that today is a busy day. Game 4 Spurs vs Miami  you know everyone is at BJ\'s trying to catch the game. We ordered food for pickup and our friends went ahead and picked it up for everyone in the house.This is what we ordered:1. Bison Burger2. Shrimp Scampi Pasta3. Cajun Pasta4. Shrimp TacosOnce there  my friends were told that the order will be ready in less than 10 minutes. An hour later  they were still waiting for the Shrimp Tacos. They left before the game started and came back after half-time (imagine that-- 10 minutes my ass.)Secondly  when the food arrived  we found out that the Scampi Pasta wasn\'t even there. We got Alfredo Fettucine instead. SERIOUSLY?! It was already an hour long and then you couldn\'t even get the order right?!Then when we tried to call Mr. William Morthole  the Senior Manager (he provided his card and told us that he will take care of us next time--thanks for the gesture) and he was busy on the phone and couldn\'t call us back. We called again to get assistance from a different manager and the ""best"" she could do was price adjust the meal. I\'m sorry. That\'s not the best you could do. I ordered a Shrimp Scampi and got forced to eat a bland fettuccine alfredo. What if I had been a pescatarian  would you have told me that the best you could do was price adjust my meal that I couldn\'t even eat? Should I even be paying for a meal I did NOT want? NO. This meal should\'ve been given to me for free. And as I just got off work and was ready to eat dinner  I ate it. I sucked it up and ate a meal i did not want. This is what I think BJ\'s should\'ve done:1. Don\'t tell us that the meal is ready in ten minutes when its not. Say it will be ready in an hour if its going to be ready for an hour.2. Don\'t offer your card and contact number if you have no interest on following up.3. Don\'t let your customer pay for food they didn\'t order -- clearly this is a fuck up on your end--this means it should be on the house.Oh  this incident literally happened just about an hour or two ago.

I was about to do a Guinness but tried their dark beer (forget the name of it) and went with a pint of the home-brewed dark. It was quite good.

My $12 pasta tasted like Kraft dinner. My friend's pizza was teeny tiny and burnt. The reason that this place isn't demoted down to 1 star is because of the wait staff that really did try to be friendly and helpful  and because of its location.

There was about a 30-min wait when we arrived around 1pm  but that was expected.  The hostess (w/glasses) was nice  warm  smiley  and accurate with our estimated wait time and once our hand indicator lit/buzzed - we were off to be seated. That day had a give-away. All the men at the table were given a beverage glass commemorating Father\'s Day. I thought that was very nice!We did have a few mishaps during our lunch. The first one was that the booth wasn\'t entirely wiped down and clean. That was a bit awkward. One side still had come crumbs and grease on the bench. So we had to wait for them to get a rag to clean that off for us. Once seated  we decided to order three pizzas:Gluten-free thin crust pizza; w/artichoke hearts  roasted garlic  and cilantroHand-tossed pizza - BJ\'s Classic Combo (Pepperoni  Italian Sausage  Mushrooms)Deep Dish pizza: Chicken Bacon Ranch (Grilled garlic chicken  Applewood smoked bacon  jack and cheddar cheese  red onions  diced tomatoes and a drizzle of ranch dressing.While waiting  we were brought our drinks and soon after our plates.The second mishap was that the plates they brought were still dirty. It may have run through their dishwasher  but there were dried up cheese residue on a couple plates and specks of ""I don\'t know what"" on another. The waiter promptly replaced them after I addressed it. This time  the plates were perfectly clean and spotless. We had a well-mannered and polite waiter.It wasn\'t too long a wait for all the pizzas. Looked good  but I didn\'t hear any ""mmmms"" during the meal. I was average at best....but not terrible. The deep dish tasted more like a pan-style pizza and had some crispy edges similar to Pizza Hut. That had good flavor. The hand-tossed was a bit disappointing though. It was as plain as it gets and the crust was flat in both texture and taste. It reminded me of carnival pizza. I didn\'t try the gluten-free pizza (which was for my mother). She said that it tasted fine  but they forgot the cilantro topping. That was the third and last mishap. I did notify the waiter who offered to sprinkle it on  but I just asked him to take it off the bill which he did.The place itself had high ceilings  nice crowd  and lots of TV screens for World Cup coverage and the Giants game. Also - nice that there\'s a B&N next door.I really really really wanted to give a basic 3-stars  but there were just too many mishaps and I feel I need to rate based on my overall BJ experience yesterday.

After we got sat  our waitress didn\'t come over for 13 minutes to ask for our drink orders. She apologized for the wait but she was complaining about another table being a pain for her.When she served my salad... There were missing ingredients. The balsamic glaze was missing from my balsamic salad....? Along with no silverware. My husband started eating with his hands because he was so hungry and it took a good 5 minutes for me to get a fork after I had already received my salad. Then our pizza came out.... It was dough. We sent it back and apologized for being ""that person"". The manager came and brought a cooked pizza for us and didn\'t even say a word. There was no apology for the kitchen or the staff. The waitresses are walking around with their shirts untucked and talking to each other about their tables at the computers when people were waiting for drink refills. They gave us our check  finally... And then there were two pizzas on there...? We sent it back and waited 15 more minutes for them to process our check because the manager was the only one who could comp it off... But the manager  William  was busy. I would have at least figured they would comp off some of the meal or at least offer....? Considering they made is late to pick up someone from the airport because it took 20 more minutes to cook a new pizza the RIGHT way. Needless to say.... It was a terrible experience and there was no organization. There were several tables unhappy about the service and we will not return. Worst BJS I have ever been to.

She also said that some of the things on the flyer weren\'t available here  but never said which were or were not available. When we did receive our order one entree was wrong (why would you put onion strings on a Burger you acknowledged and referred to as Gluten Free)  one was missing and didn\'t arrive until everyone else had finished and we never got a refill of our drinks.

Their pasta dishes  calzone& pizzas are really good. But I would probably spice up their artichoke dip and Santa Fe egg rolls. Them make their own root beer &cream soda; both of which are sooo yummy. And free refills. (Win!) Their drinks are also really good. Their strawberry &wild berry mojitos are very good. They have a good selection of beers including ones that are brewed by them. And you can't leave BJ's without having a pizookie. The best invention. We got the salted caramel pizookie &it was sinfully good. It was a caramel cookie with toffee bits topped with vanilla bean ice cream  caramel drizzled over and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square for the final touch.

225,Vicky H.,Millbrae  CA,118,143,425.0,2014-07-15,4.0,"We went to BJ\'s for FIFA World Cup Final on Sunday morning  arrived around 11am and got ourselves seated at the bar area  right in front of the big screen TV. :D The bar tender/server introduced himself as Keith as we browsed through the menu almost as thick as a ""textbook"" (similar to the size at Cheesecake Factory). We found Keith being personable and put in an effort to engage in a conversation  asking which team we support and how we\'d see the outcome of the match. He maintained a smile at all times. We appreciated his courteous service and friendliness as he still attended to us given the chaos and packed crowd that later gathered and surrounded the bar area once the match began. At BJ\'s  their traditional wings are to die for  an appetizer I highly recommend. I also prefer their Great White pizza since I am not a big fan of red sauce. From their own line of brews  I\'ve always liked Jeremiah Red  an ale that is rich in flavor but not overly bitter  as well as Nutty Brunette  a chocolate-flavored dark ale  delicious! One funny incident worth mentioning is that the guy who sat next to me at the bar area wasn\'t from the neighborhood and it was his first time visiting BJ\'s. He was totally impressed by the menu selection (he ""studied"" for quite a while) and said it could be a dangerous place should he come more often. I could tell he was quite happy with the experience even though the team he cheered for ultimately lost--sorry Argentina!Overall  it was one good FIFA Final experience and kudos to Keith for the good service provided. I am glad that the crowd wasn\'t overly rowdy or obnoxious as people could get emotional cheering and rooting for their favorite team to bring home the trophy. :) It is a fun sports bar and restaurant to watch a game.

660,Ellie D.,San Francisco  CA,9,39,2.0,2014-07-20,1.0,"If you\'re trying to place an order over the phone  calls are routed to a call center! Whoa! I learned this for the first time after I was placed on hold for 15 minutes by Jake from State Farm errrr BJs Call Center! Customer service at this location has been declining over the years - I\'ve had a number of not-so-great experiences here and it doesn\'t seem like management cares to up their game. While I did get a small apology from their manager  Brandy  it was more of a forced apology rather than a genuine one.So I\'m writing this review as I\'m waiting another 45 minutes on top of my promised pick-up time for my order and I\'m wondering what the hold up is to pop out 2 pizzas from the oven. There\'s another guy waiting next to me who\'s been waiting for over 30 minutes for his order  too. After 30 minutes  I overhear the staff saying there\'s a problem with my order  something about the cooks not seeing online orders on their end  so obviously that meant my order hadn\'t even been started yet at that point. I contemplated walking out but I had already stood there for over 30 minutes. If you read my other Yelp reviews  I\'m a very reasonable person. I don\'t write negative reviews just because an employee was rude or just because my food didn\'t come out as expected. But this review is a result of cumulative wtf experiences here. And management doesn\'t care to improve. If this was a dine-in order  there is absolutely no way someone would wait 45 minutes for a pizza. So it is absolutely unreasonable for a take-out order to take 1 hour for 2 pizzas when typically  as I was told  take-out orders are ready in 15 - 20 minutes. And although Brandy heavily discounted my order  she seemed hesitant to do so and quickly walked away after giving me my receipt without any explanation as to the reason for the long wait. My other experiences at this location were just as ridiculous. I remember a few years ago when I had a newborn and BJs just started brunch hours (10am I think?). My family and I were there right as they opened and I politely asked if I could be seated somewhere where I could keep my stroller next to me (as I had a baby sleeping inside)  and the server looked around the entire restaurant and said ... NO  sorry  we don\'t have any seats available where you can keep your stroller. What the?! I looked around the entire empty restaurant  as we were the first ones there at 10am  and explained that my newborn was sleeping and being that the restaurant was practically EMPTY  could we just sit in a corner or anywhere for a quick brunch as I had not been out of the house in months (newborn  remember) and she just looked confused and explained that strollers have to be stowed in the front and blah blah blah  I stopped listening and wanted to strangle this b*tch who did not understand how parents of newborns were lacking on sleep and super exhausted and how much effort it took just to get dressed and get a baby out of the house. Excuse the language  it was like de ja vu all over again. In the end  a manager came out and apologized profusely and explained the fire hazard with a stroller blocking a walkway  but offered to let us sit at any corner table or against the wall or somewhere in the back  and practically begged us to stay as we were getting ready to walk away  but I was too upset at that point. And there was this one time we sat and waited 30 minutes at a booth at the bar and the servers were pointing fingers at each other about who was supposed to be taking care of our table. And another time during lunch when we all ordered from the lunch menu or the soup/salad combo and were charged full meals for each item and the server said  ""Oh  I didn\'t realize you wanted a lunch portion."" But I clearly said  we were all ordering from the lunch menu. And then that started a train of confused servers who were bringing out our meals and then taking them back so that it was a smaller lunch portion. My favorite is when they bring you someone else\'s order and when you tell them that\'s not what you ordered  they get upset like it\'s our fault they\'re holding 3 dishes in their arms and they don\'t know where to go.The 1-star is for Vicki  who was incredibly professional handling take-out orders. I would actually give her 5 stars for the way she handled everything. Not once did she roll her eyes or even give me the slightest bit of attitude whenever I came up to ask her how much longer my order would be. She was calm and apologetic  and told me she completely understood why I was so frustrated. She seemed more pulled together than their manager and the other employees. This was probably an off night for take-out orders because I watched her apologize to every single person for the delay with their take-out order  but nevertheless  she was professional. I\'m glad to see people like her at the front lines handling all that stress.",2.16,2.35,2.348,1.5080000000000002,2.2740000000000005
489,Vivian L.,San Francisco  CA,72,127,39.0,2014-07-22,2.0,Went here for the first time with my family today. We got calamari appetizer  full rack of bbq ribs  salmon dinner  and shrimp scampi pasta. The calamari was great. Very crunchy and decent sized. The bbq ribs were nothing special. Salmon dinner smelled really burnt and was the size of my palm. Shrimp scampi was the most disappointing of all. I looked at it and knew it wasn't going to be good and i was right. It was flavorless. Everything looks better pictured in the menu. The shrimp scampi  ribs  and salmon dinner from elephant bar are 10x better than this place's. Service was ok. Bill came out to be $75 not including tips. Extremely overpriced for the poor quality food. Will not be returning.,2.2,2.34,2.348,1.704,2.284
559,Courtney Q.,San Francisco  CA,447,137,71.0,2014-07-22,2.0,BJ's just aint what it used to be. I've ordered the chicken baked potato every time ive been to BJs for years now and it just isnt up to par with what it used to be. Went from delicious to just a meh super starchy thing. The size of it also went WAY down. I remember the first time I got it  my eyes lit up as they marveled at the sheer enormity of the potato. On the plus side  it comes with a salad now. You have to find the potato on the lunch menu (you can still order it for dinner) if you want to order it.It wasn't just the potato that lost its grandeur though. My friend sitting next to me got one of their pastas and she said it used to be super yummy but was just bland now.The server was accommodating for our large group of 10 or so  and you still get the birthday pizookie.,2.2,2.33,2.348,1.704,2.2780000000000005

Then our waiter came and took our orders. He was nice and all but he forgot our appetizer plate. He ended up not charging us though  And the food sucked! The salmon was smelly and totally not fresh and the pasta with meatballs had no flavor whatsoever. Awful food seriously,2.2,2.32,2.344,1.6720000000000002,2.2720000000000002

Our server was very slow  I don't know her name but she only checked up on our table twice. Appetizer (artichoke dip) was cold. They need a new manager or something.

468,Justin B.,San Francisco  CA,117,115,197.0,2014-08-01,3.0,I have been to this Bjs a few times and had good experiences. The food is always consistent and fresh. They have great lunch specials that hit the spot and are very affordable. Service is pretty good and we usually get seated quickly during lunch. Most of the time we are in and out within 30-45 minutes. Great location too  right off the 380 and 280. Today we ordered the bbq lunch slider special and was delicious. Only $6.95 and came out 10 mins after we ordered it. They also have a great rewards program where they give you free desserts based on points and sometimes discounts.,2.16,2.34,2.352,1.868,2.268

Clam chowder was a tiny bit salty for my taste although it's very filling Service- we had several ppl and one of them was pretty helpful. Our waiter was attentive and apologetic for keeping us waiting If it's crowded see if you can just grab a table near the bar area. It's first come first serve. We saw ppl waiting for tables and when we walked in we found a table and say down. We are done w dinner and I see ppl still we airing for their table.,2.24,2.35,2.348,1.868,2.3060000000000005

And when someone did come he was just walking by not even a waiter in our section.. I think his name was mike he was coo.. Let this place be your last option to eat.. Shitty service just because about 8 waiters/waitresses walked passed us without saying a word.. Except mike only why I'm giving this place 2stars.. Food was alright 4.5/10,2.08,2.31,2.324,1.8960000000000001,2.2180000000000004
342,Donald W.,San Francisco  CA,117,186,1318.0,2014-08-05,1.0,I've got to say that this is by far the worst BJ's that I have ever been to  and I personally used to love this location. This is now the fifth time that my wife and I have come to this particular location in hopes that Service would've become better and within a year and a half span it has only gotten worse.The only reason why I didn't that place a one star is because of two really good employees. First  is the senior manager named Brandi Jordan who's leadership skills showed that she cares about the customers  and although the issues didn't happen on her watch. She made sure to comp our dinner and even invite us back for much better service in the future. Second was a wonderful waitress named Kelly Liu. She wasn't even our waitress been made sure to constantly check up on us after our poor service and continued to apologize as well as do her best to make us happy. It really meant slot because her section was on the opposite side of ours and yet she still made sure to make a terrible situation decent. Now back to the review. It first started off badly when it took 30 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge the fact that we were sitting down in a booth waiting to be served. I had to forcibly grab a waitresses attention just to be given our water. As she was delivering them she gave my wife and I terrible attitude and begin to roll her eyes as if we were disturbing her at her. Really  you have an attitude because paying customers wanna be served. Get over yourself lady.I then asked to speak to the manager on duty which was Brandy. She was just as troubled as to why there was such awful service. This is now 45 minutes into being at BJ's and we still have not received one dish yet. It took another 15 minutes to receive our appetizers by then it had been a full hour since we arrived and we just received our appetizers. Unfortunately for us the cheese sticks were barely warm and the spinach & artichoke dip we ordered were completely cold. So cold and that we sent it back after one bit.An hour and a half after we arrived we finally got our main dish and our mixed drinks. I was truly disgusted to find cakes on filth surrounding my drinking glass. So bad it was everywhere as if know one attempted to wash the glass. I had to send my drinks back. But once again Kelly made sure to apologize for the mix up and made sure that our main course was hot and satisfied our needs. She even brought over new drinks for us and would leave until we were happy. She constantly kept a smile on her face and made sure to explain what was going on. I've learned that no matter how many people they hire and how much time goes by the service at this particular location just continues to get worse and worse. Occasionally you'll find a few diamonds in the rough like Kelly  who really take their job seriously and treat their customers with compassion but unfortunately there's not enough of her to turn around this said establishment. In my opinion if you do go to BJ's only go when it's slow. Otherwise you will be set up for disappointment and considerable letdown. At this point I'm done with this place and refuse to go back  no matter what!!!,2.08,2.27,2.324,1.7640000000000002,2.1940000000000004

I\'ve been to this restaurant about 6 times  each time I go in hoping for things to be better but I\'m disappointed every time.Also  BEWARE  sometimes if you ask to speak to a manager  some of the servers will come to your table posing as a ""service manager"" to try and resolve matters on their own without involving the REAL manager!The food here has not been satisfying  either...almost as crappy as their service!

842,Paula M.,El Cajon  CA,26,3,,2014-08-13,1.0,My family and I waited over an hour for a table that was supposed to be available in 30 minutes only to be greeted by the ditziest waitress I've ever had the displeasure of encountering in a food establishment. She took the drink order and then popped by 10 minutes later to say the drinks would be right up  implying that someone else was delivering them. But no  it was her  another 10 minutes later. When she finally took the food order  it started to arrive before we had silverware. I asked for silverware and a glass of ice. She came by to check on us a while later  but didn't bring the silverware or the ice  so we reminded her again  and she asked how many we needed  unbelieveable! She couldn't see? or couldn't count? The food was marginal at best  but it's the lack of service that will keep me from ever returning. This was the first time in my 50+ years that I didn't leave a tip.,2.04,2.2,2.304,1.924,2.136
1235,R M.,San Bruno  CA,1,15,,2014-08-14,1.0,I am giving this restaurant 1 star because two times in the past month my service was terrible.

Thinking I would have a better experience I returned today. I ordered a half sandwich/soup combo. I received my sandwhich eat before the soup ( I thought it makes more sense to bring soup first) and also again the fries were cold. So when I ask for ranch this time tell me why it was THE SAME SITUATION?? literally asked 2 different waiters for ranch 2-3 times and took around 10 minutes  they did a lil better. When I told her I never received my ranch she didn't seem to care and said  'ok I'll get it now' and she wasn't on game with my refills either. this time again  very little tip left and i will most likely not eat here again..,2.04,2.2,2.292,1.924,2.136

I walked out trying to figure out why no one greeted me. Was it because I was dressed in a suit? Did I intimidate the staff too much? Was it because I smelled? Because I remember taking a shower.

Some busser sent our food back  the burger came back with yellow cheese still melted all on the sides and soggy half friend jalapenos. Whatever i can deal.. The waitress shows up to refill my water glass  with no ice  So I asked for ice and she came back with a huge glass full of ice slammed it on the table with the biggest attitude. After waiting for over 30 min for our check still no sign of our waitress so I went to track her down. Only could find the hostess  who sent a new person with out check. We were on the patio because we had a dog  after we had our bill and were getting ready to leave  the waitress brought out a small bowl of water for our dog. WTF!! why would you wait till we are leaving. The umbrellas were also set up  but the wind was blowing like crazy  there were more then a few times my fiance had to catch the umbrella from falling on our table or hitting one of us in the head!!

My favorite thing to get though is the great white pizza. Ohh that garlicy goodness.... As for drinks though I've only actually enjoyed the strawberry splash  strawberry patch and strawberry mojitos (if you cannot tell by now I really like strawberries). In my opinion there is not a strong alcohol taste which is perfect for me. Sometimes the wait can be a bit lengthy. I came here on friday around 7 and the wait was about a little over an hour.

535,Melissa C.,Pacifica  CA,56,11,4.0,2014-09-20,1.0,"The last time I came here I had the worst experience of waiting over 30 minutes to order  over an hour for two drinks and one appetizer  and another 30 minutes for my check.I only came back because after the horrid experience and complaining to the manager  they comped our $20 bill.For a Friday night  it was not busy at all  yet it still took more than 15 minutes to be acknowledged in the bar area and only AFTER our friend went up to a server to ask for menus/service because another table who came after us (that wasn\'t even fully seated yet) was being helped first.From our previous experience  we wanted to order our drinks ASAP for we feared we wouldn\'t get to order at all  we got the drinks in an orderly time  but had to wait to order any food.About three wrong orders of Hennessy&Apple Juice  a pizookie  and waters(with four full waters sitting on our table)  our server saying they\'re still ""cooking"" our chips  her handing us plates for chips  and no extra napkins and 35 minutes later  we receive our correct order of CHIPS AND FRICKEN DIP.Literally  the only reason why this place gets a star at all is for one  yelp doesn\'t allow less that one star and two  the dip was kinda good. Service can really make or break an experience and its terrible that I\'ve had nothing but horrible service in this establishment.",2.12,2.19,2.268,2.116,2.1620000000000004
456,Brittney V.,San Francisco  CA,60,32,,2014-09-23,1.0,F!! F F F!! I've given this place so many chances and every time I have had shitty service. Waiters are slow  hostesses have attitude  and every time a manager has to step in (which is often)  it's always someone new. Hmm...I am done with you BJ's. I don't care how close you are to my apartment. And your tap water actually tastes like tap water!!,2.08,2.17,2.268,2.148,2.1340000000000003

Also  they have great lunch specials that are a total deal  like the unlimited soup and salad for only $7.95 (you can change up the soup and salad with each order). For the beers the Jeremiah Red is my favorite  as is the Berryburst Cider (also good as a half and half ""JerryBurst""). My only complaint is that the service here is SO slow. Everyone is friendly  but I every time I have come to this location I have had to wait extremely long for the food to arrive. One time it took 55 minutes after ordering my meal at lunch time to receive my food  and my sandwich was cold while my friend\'s food was hot. This location obviously needs more food runners or something because waiting 20+ min to receive any food (such as apps) is just too long at lunchtime.",2.16,2.19,2.276,2.412,2.1780000000000004
741,JJ S.,Sunnyvale  CA,101,90,128.0,2014-09-24,2.0,Service - our first server was great! She came by pretty often and checked if we needed anything but our second sever  I wished I remember her name  was horrible. We asked 2 times for a refill of our coffee and strawberry lemonade and I had to get up and request it a 3rd time by looking for her. The Ahi Poke wasn't too good. Just going to end it here because I can write more but it just isn't worth my time.,2.16,2.2,2.28,2.3440000000000003,2.184
798,Adel H.,Daly City  CA,1,89,,2014-09-26,2.0,Service was pretty horrible. How many times do I have to repeat myself to get something? I told the server like 4 times for a to-go box and eventually got it. He told me he would bring me back more water  but did that happen? Haha no. No refill during the whole dinner. The fresh Atlantic salmon was decent (hence the 1 extra star). Everything else fails.,2.08,2.18,2.28,2.3760000000000003,2.14

BJ\'s San Bruno: A series of unfortunate events:1) 10 minutes before we had anyone come to our table and ask us for our drinks (11:40am on a Sunday)2) Our server handing me 5 sets of utensils to distribute to the rest of our party instead of laying them on the table3) Our ""deep dish pizza"" looking like DiGiorno\'s in depth and taste 4) Our server saying that that really is how they serve deep dish pizza and pointing at the pizza tray as if ""deep dish"" refers to 2-inch baking sheets and not type of pizza we should be expecting. (For the record  we\'ve been to other BJ\'s locations that had true deep dish pizza  in baking accessories and in actual pizza.)5) Another server admitting that there was something wrong with their fridge which is why the pizzas weren\'t coming exactly like they normally do  but doing nothing to improve the situation.6) Our party looking for the manager and finding no one.7) Overall douchiness of our server. Think Mendez from Orange Is The New Black. We were really debating on whether or not to pull a LeSean McCoy and give a $0.20 tip. We didn\'t end up doing so  but I totally understand where he\'s coming from.3 stars because the tomato bisque soup  french toast and spinach and artichoke dip were actually decent.

They screwed up on some things  though the pizza was fantastic. I ordered the bison burger with fries  and it was delicious! A bit over-cooked  but what do you expect from a place like this? I can tell you that our server was nice  but she left for her break in between without warning  and came back later! This place is also prime vampire territory. I know it's for the ambience  but the restaurant is so poorly lit I might as well guess who I'm talking to. Overall satisfaction for me.

913,Lily S.,San Francisco  CA,90,76,49.0,2014-09-29,1.0,it has been a good while since we last visited BJ's but hey the BF and I thought we should give this place another chance. So we get there around 7pm and was told that there would be a 25 min wait  which was great since it wasn't an hour. So our buzzer finally rings and we get seated. Service was a little slow from the get go but it's okay since we weren't starving or anything. We start off with a pepsi and a jerryburst (1/2 jeremiah red and 1/2 berry burst cider which i had to explain to the server) then we order a calamari and a large pizza to share (half great white and half buffalo chicken. Asked the server to not put any mushrooms on the pizza and to add garlic. Got the calamari and it was cold and spongy not like it should be which is light and crispy ate it anyways. The Pizza finally arrives 40 mins later and guess what .. my side was covered in mushrooms. Flagged down the server and told her i asked for no mushrooms and she said yup i told them no mushrooms and i told her well why is it covered in mushrooms then.. she said she apologizes and that it was the kitchens fault and not hers so she takes the pizza back. She comes back with the same pizza and tells us that go ahead and keep this pizza and she asked the kitchen to make a personal pizza with no mushrooms of the great white. That's fine and all but as soon as the bf started to eat the pizza i noticed it was doughy so i asked him if it was cooked through  he told me to try it and i did and it wasn't cooked all the way. The pizza was hard to rip and the bottom was doughy and undercooked not crunchy at all  so we had to send it back. Management comes by and apologizes and tells us that he has a new one in the oven  i told him to cancel it and that i would just like the bill for the calamari and 2 drinks but management was nice and told us to not to worry about it and told us that when we were finished we could leave at anytime and to visit them again in the future. So 1 star for that! I don't know how soon we would return  but we probably will come again to see if they got better,2.28,2.22,2.284,2.148,2.244

Didn't say I'll be with you in a minute or anything. Just dropped off 2 glasses of water and walked off. (This was after 10 minute wait already). We waited another 5 mins another waitress took an order of the table next to ours (which just sat down). We left. I always have really bad food here (nasty mushy burgers) and just God awful service. Trust me your job is not that hard. Figure it out. Never coming back again. Gave it a few tries. Not worth my time or money,2.4,2.25,2.292,2.308,2.31

I say half of the tables were occupied? but most of the folks were done? from what it looked like they had 2 bar tenders  and 2-3 servers and possibly 1-2 bussers? finally a server came by with water! she dropped off 2 glasses of water when we a total of 5 people at the booth! she didn\'t say ""I\'ll be right back with some more water"" or ""we will be right with you"" or anything. just dropped off 2 glasses and dropped off the rest of the waters to another table that was seated AFTER us in a section that was empty when we walked in where someone had mumbled to us and having us sit else where. as the 5 of us sit there staring at the 2 glasses of water and the servers standing around or going back and forth  still nobody acknowledged us or told us they would be with us. we looked around and other tables that were seats after us were having their orders taken  but not once did anyone look our way to see if we needed help or again let us know that they will be with us. we sat and waited and finally I decided I couldn\'t wait anymore. we all finally decided at 11:35pm to leave. 35 minutes for 2 glasses of water and nobody to check on us if we were ready. no thank you. to the management of this establishment  you need more trained and attentive staff. I myself help bar tend and manage a very busy bar nightclub  and everyone that I was with is all in customer service related or hospitality fields and felt the level of service or lack of  was unacceptable. we will NOT be coming back ever. even if you retrain and notify your staff and offered us a discount or a comped meal/drink (cause it would probably take 45 to get that meal or drink) apparently we aren\'t the only ones that feel this way since a lot of the reviews all say the service is really lacking. good luck to whoever manages this place. and especially good luck to whoever tries to enjoy this establishment with some food or a drink.",2.4,2.25,2.288,2.308,2.31

We were just missing our mini pizza dish  but what if we did order more food? That\'s not the way to approach a table. He didn\'t even say hi. On top of that when we were leaving  the same food runner hogged up the whole aisle as we were passing by each other and didn\'t even give me room or said excuse me.

I've had the Shrimp Scampi  Parmesan Crusted Chicken  and a few pizzas. Do yourself a favor and ignore the calorie count for everything. I have always had worthy service at this location. On two occasions I had an older gentleman as a server when I was seated in the back and he was on point both times. I once got a younger awkward kid who hadn't been a server very long  or so it seemed. The large amount of TV's airing the 49ers game made up for it. I also had a new server named Lisa recently who was the brightest and bubbliest person I've encountered in a while! She was great not only as a server  but as a person to talk to while waiting for drinks and my meal. Hope you get her as a server if you dine here soon. Definitely a place to checkout if you want to watch different sporting events that are all airing at the same time (thanks to the massive amount of televisions).,2.48,2.29,2.292,2.644,2.366

I reserved a table so we did not have to wait. The server was great. Very helpful and attentive. Our food was very good. I ordered the pares an chicken. With garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. My husband ordered a steak. It came out perfect. We had a large party and 3 kids with us and you could tell they were busy but they still brought out great food and overall it was good.

But the BACON AOLIE CORN FRITTERS are like $3 and they are the best appetizer ive ever had. Stuffed mushrooms are great too. So now the service is spotty and ranges from amazing (like when Jennifer B worked there) to not soo good from others. And the wait kind of sucks because its usually busy especially the weekends.

It wasn't like she was walking back and forth very busy  which I can definitely sympathize with having been a server myself. I didn't even see her at all  so we weren't sure if she went on break or forgot about us or what  which guests shouldn't have to wonder. Finally we got boxes and a dessert menu  but I had to go to the front to ask for a manager to help. The manager said she would pay for the dessert for us  but I got the bill and the dessert was still on there. I don't really mind if they don't offer to take anything off the bill  but at least do it when you say you will.

So we ask another waitor if he can do it for us he said no our waitress has to do it and we also told him one of us is paying in card.

Although that quickly turned more into neglect as we barely saw our server. When we did catch her  it was to remind her that 2 people have yet to get their food after 40 minutes of waiting as others finished their meal. Apparently  one of the dishes met an unfortunate accident. But as for the other one  she just totally missed. The manager did comp my friend a salad  but at that point  he was too hungry to care.

She then walks back towards us and picks up the dropped dollar and slides it in her pocket  thinking we didn't see her. We all watched this happen and gave her the chance to give it back but she never did. I don't care if it was just a dollar  it's still stealing. On top of that she smelled of strong cigarette smoke and had a lot of attitude. She would've racked up a nice tip with us bc we spent a good amount. I rarely have good experiences here.

We ordered waters and told him we were all set to order. He said okay and then he left without taking our orders.

272,Roger P.,South San Francisco  CA,653,363,3591.0,2014-10-29,4.0,I came back to give it another try. I have to say it's been a big improvement since I last came. The menu has changed  the service is prompt and my food was hot when it came!The menu has taken on more of a fresher look to it. The grilled chicken  the new choices of salads  just a nice refreshing choice of food items. I had a nice grilled chicken pasta. Juicy chicken with broccoli in a yummy Alfredo sauce. I'll be back to try the other items for sure,2.8,2.32,2.316,2.2239999999999998,2.512
758,Jay S.,Emeryville  CA,2,61,4.0,2014-10-30,4.0,This was our third time at B&J brewry when we walked in the wait was 15 to 20 minutes and finally we were seated. Several managers pass by our table so I grab one and let them know that our last past experiences at the restaurant was negative she promised that his time it would be good and it was so I'm going to give it a 4-star our food was excellent I can't promise the next time we go it'll be good I might just have to tell the manager each time I go about the negative experience I had several months ago. My advice to people when you go to a new restaurant rate each experience meaning each time you go back to the restaurant don't judge a book by its cover.,2.92,2.34,2.328,2.192,2.572

884,Rob H.,Pacifica  CA,0,3,,2014-11-03,1.0,I have only written one other review on here but this needed to be done. This will be and last time I will go here. TookMy wife here for lunch. Worst service and food. We sat down and I ordered the classic burger cooked med and my wife ordered the unlimited soup and salad. After a few mins my burger came out  waitress drops it on the table and left. No can I get you mustard or ketchup. anything? Just walked away. Let us sitting there for another 20mins waiting for my wife's soup and salad. No other wait staff would stop for us when we tried to flag the employees down for help Finaly was able flag down the hostess and ask for her order. She said she would ask the manager. ( just want the food) finally after another 10mins out comes my wife's food. The different girl drops it on the table and asked if she wants anything else and stats to walk off as I ask for ketchup. It didn't end there. But now to the food  soup was cold  salad was warm  burger was well done ( order was for med) and bun was stale and hard. we didn't complain we just ate. Waitress never came back to ask for anything else  wife had to flag down another waitress to get a refill for her soup ( menu said unlimited!?!?) got attitude for that as well. Waitress wouldn't get more salad for her   and we had to wait another 15 mins to get the bill. After we go it we waited 10 mins before we decided to just pay cash   since nobody would come and get out credit card. Worst food and waste of time ever. Don't go here,2.76,2.31,2.312,1.988,2.49

How do we have a buzzer if we never signed up? Yeaaaaaaah...- Two of our cups of water and one of our forks were filthy. Like...Food caked on it filthy  what the fuckery. - Food was meh  I had cesear salad and clam chowder. Tasted like everything came from a can  including the lettuce. My brother asked for avocado on his sandwich and only one side had it - had to flag down the waiter to get an extra piece.

373,EL P.,Daly City  CA,0,31,70.0,2014-11-09,4.0,My wife and I come here about once every 1-2 months. The last time we ate here  my wife ordered Thai shrimp lettuce wraps  and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. Thirty minutes later  our food had not arrived. A kitchen manager then came out to say that the shrimp did not pass their quality testing  so the kitchen was making another plate of shrimp lettuce wraps. My wife was given a free bowl of clam chowder while I ate my burger. The shrimp wraps came out shortly thereafter. The kitchen manager also gave us a free pumpkin pizookie (the reason we came for lunch was to try the pumpkin pizookie!). Later on  another manager came by to apologize for our wait and offered to take the shrimp wraps off our tab. I ended up just having to pay for my burger. We will likely still come back. My wife wishes the pumpkin pizookie was on the menu year-round!,2.64,2.31,2.3,2.32,2.442
998,Fashionista M.,New York  NY,2,34,,2014-11-09,2.0,The 2 stars go to our server  who gave okay service. Every time we go here (mind you it's only after watching a movie at the mall's cinema) it truly sucks from the minute you sit down to paying the check. First the host sat us at an empty station (on a busy Sat night which I could only assume a server was on break). That said  a near 10 minutes went by and 5 different servers  2 bussers and the manager passed us without any acknowledgement. The manager  an attractive woman in her late 20's  early 30's passed by at least twice and gave us no attention even though we sat there looking up at everyone waiting for service. I've worked in the industry for years and it's unacceptable. Next  the food is mediocre but we expect that  it's not even a real brewery  but we were starving and tired after the long wait. So  my main issue time after time with this restaurant is the service well lack thereof and the management in my eyes is not impressive. She could have at least stopped for a second to apologize. My friend who works for a secret shopper company will be hearing about my experience.,2.52,2.29,2.292,2.024,2.382
752,Crystal Z.,Daly City  CA,0,9,2.0,2014-11-12,3.0,I really liked this place when they first opened up but now it's just not the same. The service is slow  they check on the table 30 minutes at a time  and they are forgetful. I know it's busy but wouldn't you want business to go smoothly with more staff? The food is good but I always get the same stuff.. wings.. pizza.. grilled chicken pasta. Overall service is poor and slow. Elephant bar has way more potential than this place. I don't even want to order more food and even dessert because I know they will take forever! If your hungry don't come here!,2.48,2.31,2.296,2.1879999999999997,2.378
547,Julie M.,Daly City  CA,0,2,,2014-11-16,1.0,I've always come here to be greeted by friendly hostesses and waiters. Last night  I was truly disappointed. Not only could our waiter speak proper English but he was TERRIBLY slow. It took about 40 minutes to receive our food and it took about 10 minutes for us to devour our food from our longing hunger. To make things even better  I came home to a wonderful sitting of diarrhea and woke up at 4am to spew my guts out to my toilet. Thanks for your wonderful FOOD POISONING.,2.36,2.28,2.296,1.988,2.312
452,Allison M.,Daly City  CA,3,17,4.0,2014-11-16,2.0,The only reason i am giving this a lower rating is their service. Where do i begin...I LOVE BJS. I have been to many bjs and was excited to find one in tanforan. Boy was i wrong. I will not be going back. This is my 4th shot trying this one out .... And i know why my boyfriend hates coming here. Service is slow.. They always forgrt something... Their drinks are... Eh.I ordered a side salad last time. Did not arrive. I ordered appetizers this time... They tried to put them AFTER our food came out  apologizing that they never made it out.I think i will pass. So unfortunate because i truely love a pizza or appetizers and drinks here.I tried!!!

They brought the first meal before anyone else's. The second meal came 10 min later but was brought out wrong. So waited another 10 minutes or so for the fixed meal.

601,Jeff G.,San Francisco  CA,197,339,9.0,2014-12-07,2.0,Ehh... The food is always dependable. It's better than Chili's or Applebees. I guess what bugged me though was how slow and non-chalant the service was. We had just gotten back from a trip  it was our last opportunity for some late night  decent food. We were hungry. Really hungry. So to wait 15 minutes at a table without any greeting was almost enough for us to leave. We stayed out of hunger pains but still weren't impressed. Having been a server before  I always followed three rules: greet someone as soon as they sit down  keep drinks full and take care of the check quickly. Our server was 0 for 3. Knowing how difficult the job can be  I still left a decent tip. It could've been an off night or maybe he was having a rough day. Still though  it was an expensive meal for such crummy service.,2.28,2.28,2.304,2.184,2.28

However  today the service was really bad. It was bad enough for me to finally write a review. My girlfriend and I were very patient with our waiter  Mark  and he completely ignored us throughout our time there. We counted 6 specific times he checked on everyone in our section EXCEPT us. We were planning on eating dessert but the wait was so long  and basically killed our entire mood there. I had to physically get out of our booth in order to pay our check.

645,Diane C.,Brookings  OR,4,485,4.0,2014-12-09,3.0,hubby ordered chili  which came out immediately. he said it was good  but not as good as the last time we were there.about 10 minutes later  my quesadilla and his side of fries were delivered. needless to say  we should have been served at the same time  and there was no reason for his chili to be served from the pot so early. my quesadilla was alright - mostly tortilla - with a a few pieces of cubed chicken. one of the quesadilla quarters had one small chunk of chicken. accompanying the quesadiilla was a very small bowl of black bean soup. i had to ask for a spoon - a bit difficult to eat with a long-tined fork.i had to ask for what seemed to me an obvious refill of a soda glass - lying empty at the table's edge. rodolfo was our server  friendly  easy to talk to  but had to be nudged for the refill.,2.2,2.31,2.296,2.316,2.2660000000000005
996,Girly Foodie F.,San Francisco  CA,0,116,,2014-12-10,4.0,My hubby and I come to BJ's for the baby back ribs  baked potato and wedge salad and the most delicious BJ Porter beer! Large portions for the price and the ribs are usually very tasty and succulent. The shoestring fries are also great. Don't care much for their desserts (they need to expand the choices....Pazookies are just okay.)We have been happy 99% of the time. It's delicious  reasonably priced and the restaurant is pleasant and nicely decorated. We've always had friendly and prompt service  so don't quite get what the complaints are all about. There is often a wait if you come on weekends after 5:30pm and they can get very busy  which is a good sign.It's a chain...and geared to families and people who want a decent meal  great beer choices and full bar  and reasonably priced food. It's casual and pleasant.My only complaint would be that the restrooms need tending to more often.All in all  this is a fun  pleasant place to come have a decent meal.(I am only speaking about the ribs...that's all we ever get here.),2.32,2.31,2.308,2.384,2.314
174,Matthew L.,San Mateo  CA,608,460,3627.0,2014-12-17,3.0,Came here twice for lunch. Both times took over almost two hours...on a weekday. Service here can be kind of slow. It can take a long time to get water  and even longer for any alcoholic beverage to make it to your table. Definitely don't come here if you have an hour lunch...you're not going to be able to make it back to work in time!I've been to BJ's in other cities  and the food is comparable to the other locations that I've dined at. At this particular location  I had the country chicken steak  the seared ahi tuna salad  and the clam chowder in the bread bowl. All were pretty tasty - especially the seared ahi tuna salad  which was surprisingly good. The clam chowder was not bad either  although it tasted kind of like Progresso's canned chowder. Hopefully all the food they make is in-house and not anything canned or store bought.Parking can be a nightmare here  only because it's part of Tanforan Mall...so if it's busy with weekend (or holiday) shoppers  parking can be kind of difficult. The times I've come here I've had to park kind of far away... but I guess that might be a blessing in disguise since I can walk off a few extra calories with a farther away parking spot!Overall  this BJ's has a solid three star rating as it offers pretty good tasting food but with slow  slow service. If you plan to dine in  you should only come here if you have two or more hours to kill. Not recommended for a quick lunch break unless you're planning to order take out. Good luck!,2.4,2.33,2.308,2.1879999999999997,2.358
748,Eva L.,San Bruno  CA,0,5,1.0,2014-12-19,1.0,The service is really slow. Our server was rude when asking for our orders. She took 20minutes just to serve us water. Overall  we walked out because the service was terrible. I don't recommend this location to go too. Other BJ's are way better to enjoy the food. This location is ran by unprofessional management. I don't know why no changes have been made. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.,2.28,2.32,2.308,1.924,2.304

644,Alexander M.,Las Vegas  NV,399,976,2152.0,2014-12-23,1.0,"DO NOT.. AND I REPEAT DO NOT EAT HERE! This has to to be one of the WORST Bjs experiences that I have ever had in my entire life of eating at plenty Bjs in many different cities! I have never in my life felt so disrespected and just unwelcomed at any restaurant until now. Upon arriving we were seated and told we would be helped right away. Well our definition and their definition of ""right away"" clearly is different! The fact of the matter is they weren\'t even that busy.. I then had a question about happy hour and so the waitress said oh yeah it\'s in the bar area! No keep in mind prior to my party moving over to the bar area we were unaware of the fact that it\'s not offered on Saturdays! Why would the waitress tell us this before we moved over there and made a fool of ourselves asking for items off the happy hour menu? Things just went downhill from there because once we got another waitress about 15 minutes later she then comes over and takes our order and recommends the worse pizza ever! It came out so dry and barely and cheese or sauce! I wasn\'t going to pay for this $20 supposedly signature deep dish pizza that I couldn\'t bought in the frozen foods section ion and got an even better quality! Well once we decided we would like to switch the pizza our waitress was no where to be found and then we saw her walk over to what must be their ""clock out"" station with food in her hand ready to go home! Completely unprofessional because what most professional and accredited restaurants do is smoothly transition the new waiter or waitress to the customer. To add insult to injury my birthday happen to be this night and my friend communicated this to this waitress and do you think she cared enough to pass this information onto the next waiter? Absolutely not! Well this wasn\'t the case at all. Our new waiter Jeremy had to be one of the worse waiters I\'ve ever experienced too! He had a very nonchalant attitude about our complaints and when my friend got up to complain to the manger she seemed just as unsympathetic about the situation as her staff and that\'s exactly why I believe they behave the way they do because management itself just doesn\'t care! My advice is if your unhappy with your job then QUIT! Maybe somebody will read these reviews and actually care from the upper management or maybe we should get the corporate contact number and have them be aware of how this place is being ran because I\'m sure it\'s far from the standards that BJs implements for its staff!

I brought my girlfriend in for dinner and after waiting  we were seated to a table that had not been cleared and cleaned yet. Waitress paid no attention to us it took 10 minutes before she approached us to offer us beverages or starters. We were given dirty plates with dried sauce still on it  to use for the pizza. After telling the waitress  she disputed my claim by saying that's nothing on the plates before I corrected her and gave me replacements. It didn't help that she came out with the wrong size pizza I ordered and tried to blow it off by saying it was what I ordered. This is not to mention  she never came back with the ranch dip i asked for! 30 minutes later and I'm still sitting here waiting for my pizza. Also  beware of the sanitation of the restaurant staff. My girlfriend saw a waitress in the restroom not wash their hands before returning to work. YUCK!,2.36,2.35,2.328,1.8920000000000003,2.354

400,Kimberly E.,Hercules  CA,935,175,494.0,2015-01-01,1.0,Very  very disappointed about the service AND the food tonight.My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner here after a New Years Day adventure. And wow... I don't even know where to start. First off  we found an open table at the bar area  so we sat down and waited for someone to serve us. Not long after  someone came up to us  cleared the table and asked us if we would like anything to drink. We ordered two beers  she checked our IDs  and then left us a menu. Just one. And by the time she came back to give us another  we were already set with what we wanted to order. For appetizer  we ordered the the deep fried artichoke hearts. For entree  my boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and I ordered the soup and salad combo (I picked clam chowder and a house salad with vinaigrette on the side). First thing that came to our table was my boyfriend's pasta and my clam chowder. The moment the soup touched my lips  I knew it was not the right temperature. I mixed it and tried to see if it was just the surface that was cold  but my second spoonful clarified that the soup was in fact lukewarm. When the next food-runner came and brought us our appetizer (yes  our appetizer came after our entrees)  I sent my soup back to be warmed. Keep in mind that I ordered a soup and salad combo and my salad still hasn't shown up. Since my boyfriend's pasta was fine  he was pleased. I decided to try the deep fried artichokes. And let me just say... everything in that dish was sour. The artichokes were sour. The dipping sauce it came with was sour. The lemon they garnished the plate with was sour (hahahaha). I ended up asking my waiter for ranch  because it was overbearing. When my warm soup finally came back out  my salad joined in and by that time  I was already losing my appetite. I did take a few more spoonfuls of the soup and a few bites of my salad. But after that  I gave up. Overall  I don't expect much from chain restaurants. But this was just a huge miss.,2.4,2.34,2.32,2.116,2.364
437,Chef B.,Belmont  CA,46,12,5.0,2015-01-02,1.0,UNSANITARY alert : I ordered the jalapeo burger MR and fries. Took 45 minutes to arrive 1) the food was cold ..not even room temp..it was cold  when I asked the waiter to throw it back on the grill I got major attitude he took it and came back 5 minutes later with the same cold burger..I was too hungry at that point so I just started eating it ..BUT..the major and very nasty thing happened when I realized there were bits of white paper towels (not the same color of the napkins that are on the tables ) IN my fries...I mean it looked like they tossed the fries with bits of white paper napkins...when I told the waiter he looked at me like I just cursed his mother and asked if I wanted another one....when I said no just take it off the bill   I got nothing but more attitude ...Health code violation seems to be a norm here   I know because I'm a chef and have worked in the field as a professional for over 10 years ... Not only is the food nasty  service slow  and waiters awkwardly rude  but don't be surprised of you find unsanitary things in your food. The front of the house manager replied to my complaint by saying ; yeah I'll let the kitchen know ...if those where my cooks  they'd be written up/fired so serving unsanitary things.I'd recommend no one to waste money or risk a food borne illness from this place. I still feel a bit sick after eating here . Waiters are awkwardly rude  service sucks  food is unsanitary and management doesn't seem to really care . Hopefully they get a health dep. inspection in the very near future .,2.28,2.33,2.308,2.116,2.31
296,Audrey K.,Los Angeles  CA,167,267,267.0,2015-01-02,4.0,this is my go-to place for american food! You can never go wrong with a menu full of selections. What I love is that they are consistently updating their menu here and there. I've tried many things  from appetizers  to salads  to pizza  pasta  and the delicious and oh so deadly desserts. My go to appetizers would have to be spinach artichoke dip with chips  avocado spring rolls  calamari  and the bruschetta.My go to salad  is the crispy honey chicken  it's so deliciously good! (If I want to be on the healthier side haha)And go to entrees would be the chicken alfredo(sometimes it's done nicely  and sometimes it can be bland). Pizzaaaaaas are always deep dish! Because it's delish! Went with the bj's favorite  which consists of onions  olives  bell peppers  mushrooms  tomato  pepperoni  and sausages. It's so good and I normally dislike pizza  but when it's gourmet and deep dish.. I can't say no. Can't forget about the dessert! ALWAYS  pizzokie. When I can't decide  I go for the trio(consists of 3 of your choice). But  established that the white chocolate macadamia is always going to be the number 1.,2.36,2.34,2.316,2.512,2.348

Since this place is in a mall it can get slammed with people sometimes  making the service sometimes slow and the noise level over the top. Best bet is to get into the bar section for faster service on drinks! When it's quiet this place is great  but when there's a ton of families it's horrible!,2.36,2.34,2.324,2.38,2.348

718,Bobbie B.,San Jose  CA,0,52,,2015-01-07,3.0,I expected to not like this chain restaurant with a massive menu but actually the unlimited soup and salad at lunch was quite good. The four soups on the menu were well-prepared with good flavor accents  not over salted  and served hot. The four different salads were also well-prepared with fresh and crisp greens and good dressing. The price was excellent. There were service problems though. The food took too long  the appetizers were served after the entree. Idle wait staff ignored requests for silverware (yes a basic fork) and water. Although the restaurant was only 1/2 full they seated our party of 5 large adults in a too small booth. our waiter though was friendly and helpful but just overworked.,2.52,2.34,2.332,2.348,2.412
738,Bobby M.,San Francisco  CA,19,10,,2015-01-07,1.0,Took my daughter to this location for her 18th birthday on 1/6/15. Previous visits to BJ's in Tanforan were pretty good  but for some reason this visit was the worst. Food was mediocre and our waiter  Rainier  disappeared before serving my daughter her birthday Pizookie. A waitress asked twenty minutes later us if we were still waiting for our Pizookie. So much for the surprise. One came to our table ten minutes later. And then another PIzookie arrived ten minutes after that. We had asked Rainier to split the bill 50-50  but he didn't do it because he never returned. The waitress kind enough to help us with my daughter's Pizookie brought the entire bill to us. Totally unprofessional. Never going to that place ever again. Stay away from this place - it's just a waste of time and money.,2.44,2.34,2.332,2.212,2.38

275,Christine W.,Hamburg  Germany,125,331,263.0,2015-01-14,2.0,Where do I begin? Don't expect amazing unique food or stellar service either.I called ahead on a Friday night for a party of 5 and when I arrived they said it would take about 30 min. I'm not sure how long it would have took if I didn't call ahead and it looked like there were a lot of people waiting for a table.My family and I just browsed around the bookstore before our table was ready so there were no problems there. We were seated in their confusing 'patio' area which is pretty much part of the mall area. Though it was quieter then being seated inside  we barely saw our server throughout our dinner experience. When we were first seated by the host  it looked like someone spilled their drink or something and so the booth seating was wet so I asked if we could sit at a different booth. The host obliged but  they didn't do anything to fix the wet seat booth that we moved from. They sat a different party there and they said the same thing that the seat was wet and all they offered them was a napkin to place on the wet area. Anyways  for appetizers we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the cheesy fries to start. The appetizers came pretty quickly but we didnt have any utensils or plates. I asked the server and he said ok.....never did it....I asked again  and we finally got utensils  but by this time we finished the apps and had the greasy fingers to prove it.For an entree we shared a large pizza and it was fine. Standard pizza with a pretty good deep dish crust.Overall the experience was meh... I do love their beer offerings but everything else is not what I'm willing to pay for or have the patience for when thinking about where to go for a nice dinner.,2.4,2.38,2.308,2.3120000000000003,2.388

Nothing to really complain about.I really like that they have plenty of different things to choose from. Pizza  sandwhiches  burgers  soups  salads...... And a lot of alcohol. If you don't like to watch drunken people eat  do not come here.However  if you enjoy decent food or need to get something to eat after a mall trip  then this is a good place for you.I'm a sucker for salmon. I recommend their Atlantic salmon and their avocado egg rolls.,2.52,2.4,2.32,2.512,2.448
433,Robert F.,Daly City  CA,1,5,,2015-01-18,2.0,Went there for Sunday Brunch. There was no wait and our server arrived promptly. He politely took our drink orders and came back with our drinks and took our meal orders. That's when our good luck ran out. My coffee arrived in a dirty cup and with a soup spoon. We got that resolved when our waiter finally brought the appetizer but were then left to enjoy it with our hands until the waiter swung by again to check on us and noticed that we had no utensils or napkin setup. This was also resolved with its attendant wait so that when the food arrived  we were ready to eat. Unfortunately  while the food was just fine  my order was incomplete. This took more time to resolve. We had earlier mentioned to our server that we would be ordering more food to go and when we added this to our order  the waiter took great care in making us believe that he was paying attention to get it right. Unfortunately  when the check came  it was incorrect. We got this additional problem resolved and decided to not protest the $3.25 charge for toast that I thought came with my meal. We're were treated to watching the folks at the table next to us arguing over their check with their waiter and wondered if there is a training issue here or a deliberate pattern. We finished our meal and did not have to wait long for our takeout. We discovered that the $5.25 charge for Mac-n-cheese bought us about 7oz in a 16oz cup. The drink was $9.95 and the Bison Burger was un-satisfyingly small. My final impression is that while the food is fine and the waiter personable & accommodating  the sheer number of issues that needed to be resolved  coupled with the cost  and wait all combine to put this place on my avoid list.,2.48,2.38,2.312,2.3120000000000003,2.42

The service is EXTREMELY SLOW  our first waiter was a caught by the person at the end of our table rolling his eyes and sighing after being asked for something by the person at the opposite end of our table.When the manager was told how we felt like our table has been neglected  he\'s simply said "" let me see what I can do about that"" then simply changed our waiter. No apology  or anything. The second waiter tried to make up for the first one. He did ok  but our table is full of dirty dishes as I type this.Oh  we accidentally knocked over a half full glass off soda  none of the staff offered to help clean it up and didn\'t even offer us a towel. I had to ask for something to clean it up. Then when he (the first waiter) returned  he just dropped a stack of of small square napkins on the table and walked away. If we weren\'t hear celebrating something  and NINE of us  we would have just left..... The manager never even came by the table to check on things after changing our waiter.

711,Shaft S.,San Francisco  CA,46,7,,2015-01-24,1.0,"My wife and I were having repairs done on our car at Sears and walked over to BJs for lunch. While the menu posted outside suggested above-average bar food  our overall experience was awful. I hate writing that  but my wife and I want to make sure people know what this place is like. We walked in and the hostess doesn\'t talk to us  picks up two menus  and as she is walking into the dining area says ""oh  if you want to sit in the bar it\'s open seating."" Based on her surliness  we chose to sit in the bar. We sat in the bar  were given menus  and introduced to our waitstaff rapidly. They took our drink orders promptly and came back shortly thereafter to get our food orders. We ordered the buffalo chicken wings for an appetizer  and my wife chose the Barbecue Chicken Chop Salad while I had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich.  20-25 minutes later our food came out. By ""our food"" I mean a salad without dressing and a cold beef sandwich. I am sure you are wondering about the chicken wings... So were we! We were half way through our lunch 15 minutes in) when a waitstaff (not our waiter) brings out the chicken wings. I sent them back and asked they be taken off our bill  but not before seeing a plate of what looked to be chicken pieces from birds ravaged by tuberculosis. In the long run  we are healthier for not getting them.When our waiter finally came back to our table  about 30 minutes after the last time he came by  he apologized for the wings and we asked him for some salad dressing. He comes back several minutes later to crack jokes and let us know the chicken was taken off the bill  but forgot the salad dressing. The kicker of the meal - before we could give our waiter feedback on our crappy experience HE WENT ON LUNCH BREAK! We were passed to another waiter who also avoided our table for another 20 minutes. My wife and I do not openly complain about things  but this experience was the worst we have ever had in a restaurant and we will not be going back to this establishment",2.28,2.38,2.3,2.308,2.34

Instead of getting helped  was ignored by every waiter that insisted on helping everyone who had sat down after me....I wouldn't expect amazing service in a self seating bar  but I am incredibly disappointed in the wait staffs inability to communicate their assigned tables to each other. Sitting for over 20 minutes waiting for someone to help me is a bit past forgiveable. Being curious I waited for how long it would actually take. Once she dropped a menu she proceeded to help two other tables that had just arrived. It took about 30 minutes to get my drink on a slow Monday.

Bear in mind  I wouldn't touch Pizza Hut today unless I was absolutely desperate. But 20+ years ago  Pizza Hut deep dish was the best!I've been here three times now  and each time I've tried a different Deep Dish. The Veggie continues to remain my favorite - the the buffalo chicken is a close second. To top it off  this place has a nice in house craft beer selection. My wife and I split two full flights (4 lights and 4 darks). I've consistently landed on the Oasis Amber as my favorite. Service is on par. The Pizza will take a bit before it comes out to the table (maybe 30-45 min) - but that's always a good sign IMO.,2.36,2.47,2.304,2.6719999999999997,2.426

As always  the fish turns out dry but the amount of sauce/butter ladled onto my rice made it yummy. Enjoyed that more than the actual entree. The veggies were a bit soft.

So she asked us what we ordered so she can check on it.....comes back out immediately and says it will only be a another 10-20 mins until it\'s done(I\'m assuming just enough time to start cooking it) so we told her never mind just give us the bill for what we have on the table....the manager came out and apologized and comped the food....we told him we didn\'t even want it and he was pretty insistent that we take the meals comped.....we told him we will wait another 5 mins....and we would leave....been here over an hour and still haven\'t even gotten the soup??

279,Tim B.,Novato  CA,54,277,8.0,2015-03-04,4.0,"So  after our wonderful excursion to Cambria we drove up Highway 1 to Carmel  then battled obnoxious traffic coming into Santa Cruz. At first I\'d contemplating continuing following the coast to check out the newly constructed Devil\'s Slide tunnel just south of Pacifica. But the Big Sur experience had tested our patience - it being Presidents\' Day  there was more than the normal share of touristy drivers - you know the type  not staying at any consistent speed. Or direction.Because of that we elected to travel Highway 17 to Los Gatos  then 85 to Mountain View where it intersects with Interstate 280  and then travelled up the Peninsula until we reached South San Francisco and got off at ""Interstate"" 380  all 2 1/2 miles of it. That proved too long as we exited that freeway at El Camino Real and thrust our car towards the legendary Tanforan Park.Back in the day Tanforan served as the quintessential aging 1950\'s/1960\'s mall  and by the early aughts it was playing that role in an unfortunate way  as tenants were deserting the shopping centers like Bill Cosby supporters. The powers that be decided that a renovation was in order  and by the time I returned in 2006 after a five year absence  I barely recognized the place.One can argue about the goods and evils of renovating the center  but I do think the addition of BJ\'s was a boon - before all the shopping center offered was food courts and a few forgettable cafes. Our 2006 trip to this location was the first BJ experience we had (insert juvenile joke here)  although in the meantime we have also perused the Sacramento and San Rafael locations.This time  we arrived at about 2:30 - I was thinking it\'d be rather quiet  but it was about 90% full. In spite of that  our service was prompt and professional. We each ordered from the light menu  and were satisfied for most of the rest of the day. Buffalo Bison Burger  baby!I guess my only criticism of this location is that I wouldn\'t be able to distinguish it from the other franchises - maybe there was something to highlight the fact that it was in South San Francisco as opposed to Sacramento  but I missed it. And  you\'d think that something with the word ""Brewhouse"" in its name would  you know  brew its own beer. Perhaps I\'m nave  however it is good that the place is reliable and consistent.",2.76,2.54,2.344,2.288,2.628
723,Nathan H.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,2015-03-04,1.0,Got the bbq bison burger. Incredibly shitty. Came late  asked for medium rare came back very well done.

277,Josh L.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,25,257,55.0,2015-03-09,2.0,Came for happy hour on Friday with some coworkers. We ordered one salad which was almost delivered to the wrong table (our server had to go back to the kitchen to get it). The presentation of the salad was terrible and it looked very skimpy on ingredients. We also ordered plain nachos  but ended up with a fritos/sour cream concoction (eventually the right order came out). I had the chicken wings  which were meh... they looked so small and weren't as meaty as before. The dipping sauces were watered down and had no consistency.Pizza wasn't bad and the servers were friendly. The kitchen staff needs more attention to detail and presentation.,2.64,2.52,2.348,2.088,2.568

Entrees came before appetizer. Waiter/server never came back to check on us nor refill our drinks. He was checking out every single table around us  but us! Are you kidding me? I literally had to ask the hostess for out check! Seriously don't think of ever coming back because of tonight!,2.6,2.51,2.348,2.052,2.5460000000000003

The server never even came back to see if everything was ok  after forgetting the silverware and my NA beer. This place has truly gone out of fashion. I'm being generous with 2 stars. The local small sushi places knock this out of contention normally. But I was feeling like a decent steak tonight...Fail! I always leave a tip but I can't even do that here tonight.,2.8,2.51,2.36,2.184,2.6259999999999994

475,Russ T.,South San Francisco  CA,17,20,,2015-03-21,1.0,Usually  we get good service & good food here at BJ's. Tonight is not one of those night. Tonight  my wife got the pulled pork BBQ sandwich  the thin fries & an ice tea. I got the unlimited soup & salad with a diet Pepsi. My wife's dinner was fine  but had to ask for sugar; no problem. But I asked for the chili & a house salad; the salad wad fine but the chili was a bit too salty & not very good. Then the waiter picked up the dishes & my wife had to remind him I got the unlimited soup & salad. I ordered a broccoli & cheese soup  a caesar salad & a refill on my drink. First came my drink  then the soup but the salad never came. The soup wasn't good either & I had enough bad service. I asked for a box & our check. The waiter knew him blew it & sent another waiter to deliver the check. Just as I paid the check  the salad came. The perfect end to a crappy meal. Get some better help  BJ.,2.84,2.55,2.372,2.116,2.6659999999999995
230,Anne R.,Hercules  CA,5000,810,318.0,2015-03-22,3.0,Possibly one of worst customer service experiences ever. Came here pretty late and an hour about closing time so you would think service would be better  even though it was busy. We got seated right away and our server greeted us and asked for our drink order and shortly after we ordered our our meals. I will also add that the bjs menu is really large so you have plenty of options to choose from! Once we got our food  which was pretty good by the way  our waiter was never to be seen again. We waited around for about 40 minutes or so after wards and he still didn't come around  not even to refill our drinks. We he finally showed up to help the table across from us  we asked for the bill and he apologized for the wait as it had been busy. Overall  the food was good and the place was large and full of life but the service could have been much better as it was a bit on the slower side and the waiters didn't show much interest in the customers at all. So would I return? I would give it another chance because the food was that good but hope that customer service returns.There is plenty of parking as there is a parking lot right in front of the restaurant.,2.84,2.57,2.376,2.444,2.678

406,Nunya B.,Chatsworth  CA,0,11,,2015-03-25,2.0,I was looking for a nice place to eat close to my hotel & thought I would check this place out. First  several parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Then I realized if you go here with children of ANY age (mine was 11)  you will be exiled and made to sit in the indoor 'patio area' directly in front of the malls main entrance. At this point the restaurant feel is gone as you watch herds of shoppers coming in and out of the front door  not to mention the loud echoing  which overall makes it feel like an overpriced meal in the mall food court. When directly asked about the children issue they denied this was there tactic. I went to this mall the next two days and all the tables on the 'patio' were filled only with families with children. So wrong.,2.84,2.55,2.376,2.3440000000000003,2.6659999999999995

444,Annie J.,San Francisco  CA,283,116,,2015-03-27,4.0,I like this place! Always easy to pop over for a drink  and the bartenders are super nice. Pizookies are awesome (be careful  they are little but pack a punch). I've also had the deep dish which was OK  but overall great place to come in the san bruno area if you want a quick bite and good atmosphere. Also a great place to come for a game.,2.88,2.62,2.404,2.512,2.724
568,Kristen T.,Beverly Crest  Los Angeles  CA,2,11,1.0,2015-04-02,1.0,We were told it would be about a 20 to 30 minute wait to be seated when 30 minutes was up we were told another 20 minutes on top of that. After about an hour wait we were finally seated with no silverware and our waiter took another 15 minutes to get our drink orders. Another 30 minutes later our food finally came and it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time because the noodles in my pasta were crunchy and stuck together and it was not warm. We still had no silverware. The manger did have new pastas made which took another 30 minutes. Another girls avocado egg rolls were made with rotten avocados and looked brown and mushy! This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant!,2.72,2.61,2.404,2.116,2.654

She took our order we both order 2 types of wings  salad and fries. Our wings arrive and we both took a bite only to eat ice cold meat . I told the young lady about our food she took it back but my mood did change . when our wings arrived it just felt like they warmed it in the.microwave. I wasn't going to say anything again just ate a little more then asked for a Togo box. Dessert was delicious. I have had better food I don't think I will be back again. The 2 stars are for the young woman who served us.,2.72,2.59,2.4,2.3440000000000003,2.6420000000000003
928,Karla C.,South San Francisco  CA,0,6,,2015-04-17,1.0,"I decided to give this place a try and was I disappointed. We waited  around (45minutes to an hour) just to be seated  after this we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks (coke  water  beer) and then 45 minutes for the food. If you have all this time to wait for a simple meal then this is the place for you. Food came and there was no silverware on the table waited another 10 minutes for someone to bring us that. The waiter was well mannered but after a while the "" I am sorry"" just gets old and seriously doesn\'t matter anymore. if this is how you treat your paying customer I can\'t imagine why your employees would even care to work there. Will not be coming back nor will I recommend your establishment to anyone for this reason.",2.72,2.58,2.392,2.34,2.636
880,Alexis E.,Sacramento  CA,0,10,7.0,2015-04-20,2.0,Tonight a friend and I decided to go to this BJ's to have dinner. I primarily visit BJ's when I am home in Southern California and love it so I decided to give this location a try. Big mistake. It was a little crowded which I expected for a Sunday evening so we had about a 20 minute wait time to be seated which was not bad. Everything from that point was downhill. We ordered an appetizer and each ordered a small pizza we waited for about 35 minutes when a manager came out and told us that the pizzas were all taking about 20 minutes longer than normal. So  we waited. Our server hardly came to check on us and when she did we felt very rushed to finish our food. She kept asking us about dessert before we were done eating our food. The Pepsi that we had was extremely flat. We finally ordered dessert  two pizookies. Those took about 30 more minutes to come out and after someone other than our server brought them out our server came and told us she was sorry that the pizookies were also taking longer than normal. Overall  the experience was horrible and I will not be going back to this location. I will stick to going to BJ's in Southern California.,2.64,2.55,2.388,2.44,2.5860000000000003
657,Jasmine M.,San Francisco  CA,11,1,,2015-04-21,2.0,Carlos sucks ass as a waiter and did from the beginning. It wasn't as busy for a Tuesday and he took long to bring our waters and walked around like he had a stick up his ass and gave me attitude when I asked him to bring us another bottle of ketchup. First of all  why would you bring an empty bottle of ketchup to a table? He lagged and was full of attitude. I was not happy with the service at all. Only left him $8 for a $120 bill. He didn't even deserve a tip. Do your job right dude and or at least fake it to get through your night. Food was good  service was awful. We even had to approach another waiter to bring us what we wanted because we needed to remind Carlos 3 times to do so.,2.6,2.52,2.392,2.472,2.552

My boyfriend told her to put herself in our shoes and she replied with ""I\'m a server"" what does that even mean? You see these dirty critters creeping around all the time in your restaurants food? On top of the unsanitary facility  the service was slow for a Sunday night at 830pm. Even when the busser said its a really slow night.

Takes forever to have someone to take your order  and the moment you finish your meal they like to rush you out. If you like to stay longer to watch the game or just chat with your friends  you better order more stuffs. Or they will keep coming to check your bill.,2.52,2.45,2.38,2.504,2.478

Thought maybe the San Bruno location would attend customers faster and boy was I wrong!Waitress took too long to take our order and we waited a long time to get our order. The mini pizza lunch was okay not good or delicious like I expected. Honestly  the Pizza Hut personal pizza from Target does taste better. Umm  you're a sit down restaurant and should serve a delicious gourmet pizza. What happened BJ's with your food quality  taste and temperature of food? It is definitely off on all levels including service and dirty utensils. Definitely this restaurant is in need of major improvement in all departments!,2.36,2.44,2.376,2.436,2.408

When he took our food order  he said he can\'t guarantee that the appetizer will arrive before our main meal (what about placing the appetizer order first then put in our dinner order a few minutes later? Just a suggestion...). We told him it was fine. Dinner plates came  no appetizers. Ten minutes into our dinner  I asked if the appetizers were still coming. ""I\'ll check on it for you."" Really?

Her name is Xinia and she super nice. We had small conversations here and there and although she was super busy busting other tables  she still stayed a few minutes here and there just to chat with us. She always had a big smile on.*Food: We ordered a bunch of appetizers. My friend ordered this American Burger but turned out to be sandwich bread instead of burger buns  which I find odd. The Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wrap is really good  especially that sweet tangy sauce they have. We also ordered fried calamari and it was so crispy...! My favorite was that Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. We asked for extra jalapenos and it was just the BEST. The fries were soft and adding that cheese + jalapenos ... *drool. I can just eat the whole thing myself!*Atmosphere: super chill. It is that perfect sports bar but with lots of food along with it too. They have dim lights with lots of TVs channeled to different sports channel.

At 8:20 I arrived on-time to pick up  before being told it wasn't ready. Time waiting before food was ready to go... 8:55. So ultimately  I waited 35 minutes AFTER my pick-up time.

412,K T.,San Francisco  CA,4,62,27.0,2015-06-23,4.0,MAIN COURSE: 3 STARS DESSERT: 5 STARS I ordered the sirloin with cheesy mashed potatoes and string beans (about $16...this steak dish comes with two sides that you can choose from like soup  fries  mashed potatoes  veggies  etc. ) I was very excited  but when I got it  everything was in very small proportions--I was shocked! The string beans and mashed potatoes were great  but the steak was not. When I order sirloin elsewhere  it is not grainy (for lack of a better word...please reference my pictures). It was juicy  but the texture was so off putting! It did not taste like steak at all. The dessert was AMAZING. We ordered a 3 pan pizookie plate (about $10)  and it was so worth it. You get to choose which three cookie flavors you'd like to have. We chose the double chocolate  white chocolate and macadamia  and a regular cookie--all topped with vanilla ice cream. The white chocolate was surprisingly less sweet compared to the other two. The double chocolate wasn't as sweet as I had expected it to be. The regular cookie was my favorite though. Bottom line: -BJ's can be pricy  but there are more budget-friendly meals on the menu. -do NOT order the sirloin -GET THE 3 PAN PIZOOKIE PLATE. SO WORTH IT.,3.12,2.62,2.416,2.8000000000000003,2.8200000000000003

491,Alyssa M.,San Bruno  CA,88,77,26.0,2015-06-27,1.0,I would like to start off by saying I have only been to the San Bruno and Foster City locations. Foster City: service is slow. Staff is attentive to their designated tables. Good customer service. Sometimes I've had to flag another waiter to get my tables check because our waiter went MIA. Overall descent. San Bruno: service is slow. Staff is not attentive to their designated area. Customer service lacks any sort of quality. The wait is always long because it's a smaller location inside a mall. On my most recent visit  I walked in and saw an empty booth I wanted but was dirty. I stood there for a few minutes and no one came. So we sat at a high top table. There were 3 servers all helping tables around where I was sitting and it started to feel awkward when we weren't being helped. It was out lunch break and we didn't have time to sit and wait for someone to never help us. After 5 minutes a waiter walked over to the table next to me  that sat down after me and he took their order. He walked right by me and wouldn't make any eye contact. If I was sitting at a table where no one was working  one he could have told me he would take care of us or had us move to his section  maybe a table over. But no. Him and 3 other servers kept walking past us. Didn't ask us anything and weren't planning on helping us at all. I walked up to the bar and the bartender just so happened to be extremely apologetic and hospitable. However my order came out wrong and it took forever to fix and by the time I got it and started to eat we had been there for 45 minutes! I do not recommend the San Bruno location at all. I overheard a server say it was going to be a good day for him because he got 20% on his first table. Wow. There were guys that sat down after U.S. But behind us and they got up and left about 15 min of waiting and no one came to help them. As a former server  I felt so angry at the workers for not informing me someone wasn't here yet  they could have helped me! But they didn't and they just lost my business and anyone I ever talk to!,3.12,2.64,2.42,2.468,2.8320000000000003

867,Kelly L.,Daly City  CA,0,12,4.0,2015-07-07,5.0,My experience at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was a terrific one. I invited my family to a dinner here last Friday. My experience with the food and customer service was excellent. Our waiter  Leo  was very patient and friendly. He smiled all the time and for the most part  he made sure that all of our concerns were taken care of. For example  we were worried because the pasta did not come out after about 30 minutes  however our pizza was already out. He made sure that the pasta came out and got to us. I admired him a lot because he had to tolerate my aunt who complained about the salad and mostly everything  which I give him props to. The deep dish pizza (BBQ chicken) was tasty as usual and the pasta (ravioli) was also good. By the end of this experience  I was pretty full  but as usual  we had to order the pizookie. The pizookie the best part of the whole food experience. The wonderful warm feeling of that awesome buttery cookie was just so yummy and delicious that it made my taste buds explode (not literally). And the combination of a warm cookie freshly baked with some vanilla ice cream just created such an experience that words not describe. I would be glad to go back to this place. Hopefully at least once  you will get Leo as your server.,3.16,2.69,2.46,2.772,2.878

Food quality is getting smaller and worse. Chefs lack presentation as well as the quality of the food. They suck. If Chef Gordon Ramsay were to review this BJ's location  he would cuss out the managers for allowing this to happen. The drinks/beers are good though.

Next to mall and near freeway exits. The food is usually good  nothing special or a must have here. The soups should have MORE in he bowl but whatever. The better reason I dont even complain is usually because the waitresses are young and cute here. The one girl i got the other day could of been more of a talker but she was so broad. She needs to tell her boo thang to hit it right. The host was banging! Pretty face and bbw  damn. I wanna take her out but she might get it all the time. On another note  be careful who is sitting next to you. I get the feeling ex felons and drug dealers come here for their sit downs. Speak soft.

My friend's flatware was dirty  too but he got it exchanged.I do not understand how any place can slip up in something as basic as clean utensils?

338,JD G.,Austin  TX,239,164,52.0,2015-07-24,3.0,This place is ALWAYS packed and the experience is never that great. It starts out in the crappy mall parking lot that needed to be re-surfaced 10 years ago  with no parking. Once you're actually able to make it inside  you have to wait forever to get sat. This would be understandable at most popular restaurants as they can't seat everyone at once  but when you do get sat eventually  you realize that the reason you've been waiting for an hour is because the kitchen takes an hour to even bring out your food once you order it.I went with a couple friends and after telling us the wait was 30 minutes  it ended up being an hour. The greeters were apologetic about it  and once we were sat  the server was very friendly. We ordered our food and waited...and waited...and waited. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich  which is pre-made  with fries. My friends also ordered entrees that would have been pre-prepared so there was really no reason for the wait. What made it worse was once I got my sandwich  it had maybe a spoonful of pulled pork on it. I never ask for a manager but I did to ask if that was a normal portion for that meal  and he took one look at it and before I even said what was wrong  he apologized and took it back to get a larger portion  which took another 15 minutes. He was extremely apologetic and  while I didn't ask for any compensation  he gave me my meal for free. The pulled pork  though  was amazing! And the fries are so good as well...definitely some of my favorite fries of any restaurant (except McDonald's of course).I've been to this location several times and the experience has always been similar (friendly staff but long waits). I like the food  but the experience keeps me away unless my friends are hellbent on eating here.,3.0,2.76,2.504,2.1559999999999997,2.8560000000000003
834,Gary G.,San Diego  CA,2,2,,2015-07-28,1.0,Last night I got into SFO late so I went by this BJs for dinner. They were fairly busy so I opted for a table in the bar. After sitting there for 10 min I was finally asked if I wanted something to drink. I ordered my drink and food at the same time. Tired from traveling I did not want this to take very long. Drink and food came in a reasonable amount of time but my baked potato was cold. Hungry and tired I just ate. I noticed that the table next to mine sent several items back that were either cold or undercooked. I then waiting almost 20 min after I was done to get my check. I gave the waiter my card right away. Once I did it took another 10 min for him to bring the bill back for me to sign. At this point I just wanted to leave. In my haste  I walked off and left my sunglasses. Today I called around noon to see if I could pick them up. I called and was put on hold for nearly 20 min. Finally I hung up. I called back an hour or so later only to get put on hold again for 10 min this time. When I finally did get a response I was told that no my glasses were not found. I told them that I left them there and they should be in a lost and found. Nope. No such thing. No care or concern whatsoever that I lost them in that restaurant. I know I left them on the table so they should be there for me to retrieve. Am I wrong in this? I am disappointed at the amount of time I wasted last night  poor service  cold food  and people that just obviously don't care.,3.0,2.76,2.496,1.8920000000000003,2.8560000000000003

Prices are decent for the quality of the food  but there are much better options in the area.They do have a broad selection though  including some gluten free itrms  and if you like beer they have several pages of options.If you're meeting people or want something better than food court fare at the Tanforan mall  it's ok.

People downgrading a restaurant because it is always packed really have Yogi Berra's disease. Food is consistently good - never had a bad meal there (out of 10 or so meals). I bit understaffed with waiters  but they are consistently of decent cheer. It's unlikely that you'll get a bad meal there and will sometimes have a great one.,2.96,2.8,2.504,2.2920000000000003,2.864

Mr. NSS: ""Where do you wanna eat?""Me: ""I want BJs.""Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh  you forreals?""Me: ""Yah.""Mr. NSS: ""I never knew you had 8====D envy.""Me: ""Who wouldn\'t be jealous of mandingo?""Mr. NSS: ""Uhhhh  is there something you want to tell me?""Me: ""Geez  relax...I want to eat at BJs.""I\'m not a fan of chains and I will never understand WHY people would wait up to 2 hours to eat at BJs  or any chain for that matter. But I have to admit  sometimes I need a little avocado egg rolls  cheap liquor  and pizookie (freshly baked cookie topped w/ ice cream) in my life. We came here for their Happy Hour Specials that run Monday - Friday from 3 pm - 7 pm  and Sunday - Thursday from 10 pm - close:*$1 off guest beers*$4 craft beers*$5 mojitos  martinis & wine*$6 for slightly higher tier wine*$4-$6 apps: chicken wings  flatbread  spinach dip  sliders  potstickers  avocado egg rolls  lettuce wraps  and mini deep dish pizza (reduced HH portions so you\'re not saving that much in hindsight)I\'ve visited BJ\'s more times than my check-ins indicate because my family like chains. I don\'t like waiting for a table so we usually try to snatch a table in the bar area since it\'s open seating. On our last visit  we sat in their outdoor patio and brought Tater Tot along: bit.ly/1OKVdtS. As with any chain restaurant  I always come in with very low expectations. The safest bet on BJ\'s menu are their apps and pizzas. On our latest visit  we ordered their Avocado Rolls (HH - $6) to start: bit.ly/1IAycVP. They tasted really off this time. It was sour like the cooks added too much citrus to keep the avocados from oxidizing. After downing two of my very stiff $4 Tanquerey gin & tonics (no top shelf gin)  I didn\'t mind so much. I wasn\'t feeling pizza so I ordered the Sante Fe Salad ($13.50): bit.ly/1M6EUtL which was piled high with crisp romaine lettuce  onions  red bell peppers  chicken cubes  cheese  and crunchy tortilla strips. The salad was lightly tossed in a semi-creamy dressing. Pretty decent and much better than the Sante Fe Salad I had the next day at nearby Nueve (Bayhill Shopping Plaza).Mr. NSS ordered the Ribeye ($23) which was awful! I told him that\'s not one of the items that you should order at BJs but hey  the man wanted steak. It was a cheap cut of meat with zero marbling. It was definitely not a ribeye steak but a sirloin or top round that was slapped onto a Forman Grill type of cooking device. There was grill marks but the rest of the steak looked so rubbery. He asked for rare  it came out medium well so he had to send it back. The second one was cooked better but it was just horrible quality; very tough  dry  and chewy. I had better steak at Sizzler\'s. Management  please take note: either you\'re scamming customers or your meat supplier is scamming you. Your ribeyes are not ribeyes  as another Yelper also seemed to have the same issue. Anyhow  there was no room for a pizookie since we indulged in a second round of avocado rolls  even though they weren\'t that great to begin with. Dayam you  Mr. Tanquerey!Food has always been what it is for a chain: glorified frozen food but we\'ve never had issues with any of the servers who are nice and efficient. We had the same server twice in a row and he was really nice to Tater Tot. He said  his ex-gf had a pom and that he missed him. He even showed us a pic. Awwww.....love furbabies.",3.0,2.79,2.5,1.9640000000000002,2.8740000000000006

510,Christan G.,Daly City  CA,7,5,1.0,2015-08-04,1.0,The food is decent  most of the time. But good takes long. Service is the shittiest I've ever had. It's always packed. And the food is way overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Jack's,2.96,2.82,2.512,1.7000000000000002,2.876
576,Eugenia F.,Deerfield Beach  FL,1,49,22.0,2015-08-05,2.0,I heard that it wasn't so good so put off going. Finally hubby went and liked it. We went on a Tuesday for dinner. We were seated after 5 minutes as promised  I had the clam chowder  Brussels sprouts  and we split a full rack of ribs. All were mediocre and the atmosphere was not cozy. Probably will try again for the thin pizza. Service was slow and we had to direct someone else to get check.,2.84,2.83,2.516,1.864,2.8339999999999996
675,Mike L.,El Granada  CA,610,110,,2015-08-06,1.0,Service could be a bit faster. Need more servers especially the one that served us  made it seem he didn't want to be here. Now food is good and cocktails. Servers being at lunch at too late of an hour. Entrees came out in time. The server also said they only have one bartender is clueless. They should hire a second bartender inexcusable. Repeating the menu over and over again. Like he's not paying any attention to us. Poor quality service. Now Shay provided excellent service by checking in with her staff now that's a good person to have as a staff person. Dessert Poozookie Oreo Cookie outright deserves this as a 5 star dessert.,2.68,2.82,2.508,1.8280000000000003,2.7640000000000002
367,Ahna B.,Montara  CA,661,137,11.0,2015-08-06,1.0,Wow! I am not impressed at all with this place. BJ's used to be so good when it first opened. Not sure what happened.Service is not so great anymore. Pretty disappointed food taste like its from the freezer and I am not sure who cooks at these locations but yucky. Used to love this place. Don't think I will be returning; there are to many places in the bay that provide quality food  cocktails and service. Server needs to remember he is at work not on the street not to mention he doesn't remember what people ordered and having one bartender during a game does not work after 5 pm. Waited 30 minutes for my cocktail. The only person providing exceptional service is SHAY out on the patio. She should be a manager and she should get a big fat raise. She's efficient  consistent and a very good multi-tasker. I had to send one of my cocktails back because the soda was so flat that it tasted like plastic.,2.68,2.8,2.504,1.8280000000000003,2.7520000000000002
313,Uel L.,Fairfield  CA,40,99,192.0,2015-08-15,4.0,I always come here for one reason. To eat their calamari and the ahi poke. They also have that pork chops and rib eye steak that my family loves to eat. Their clam chowder and tortia soup are their best in my opinion. I don't get tired ordering my favorite food if I'm in the vicinity.,2.68,2.81,2.512,2.128,2.758

586,Grence Whinsel D.,Pleasanton  CA,21,5,,2015-08-18,3.0,Hit and miss with the service here. Youre mostly paying for the environment. Food is mediocre. Theur desserts are the only thing worth buying but thats just my opinion.,2.8,2.84,2.532,1.9320000000000002,2.824
482,Christian B.,Hayward  CA,5,7,12.0,2015-08-19,3.0,I went here @8/17 around 1ish. I was with my girlfriend. Knowing I had work in an hour 1/2 I tried to squeeze in a quick dish and dessert and see if they would serve pretty fast. We were seated right away and took a quick second to look at the menu. I was able to use the restroom and the server still did not come to our table yet. He took about 10-15 mins. Joseph our waiter had a very soft voice like he didn't want to be there/careless. We ordered a personal pizza with one topping and a salad side and a cookies n creame pizookie. Salad came out pretty fast but the pizza took a little long and our pizookie didn't come out until I had to leave. I just wish our waiter was little more caring about his job. The pizza was delicious but my topping was like only 3 pieces of pepperoni while my girlfriend had a lot of pineapples.,2.88,2.83,2.528,1.9960000000000002,2.8499999999999996
303,Brannon T.,San Jose  CA,227,11,,2015-08-22,1.0,So you may be wondering of why exactly I am giving BJs a 1 star review. Well basically  my girlfriend and I used to come here on a pretty regular basses even though every time we come  the service is literally the worst! Management I really hope you are reading this because I am sitting here right now  20 minutes after being sat  our waiter still has not greeted us. This happens every time we come here. I go to a lot of BJs in the South Bay and never have this problem. The wait staff is rude  don't know the menu  ignore you when you are trying to get their attention  and this is the best one. Countless times when we want to order and our waiter is no where to be found and we ask the hostess to get our waiter or waitress  we ALWAYS get an eye roll.We stopped coming here because of the completely awful service even through the food is good. I hope you read this review to your staff at line up as I too were in the industry for awhile in order to put them in check or something. If you want to talk more feel free to message me  but this has seriously got to stop!,2.88,2.8,2.524,1.7320000000000002,2.832
460,Toni S.,Daly City  CA,3,28,28.0,2015-08-27,1.0,Horrible horrible service. Server was non attentive  order was wrong  couldn't get the attention of the server to even make the correction. When the order finally came it was burnt and had to be sent back  which took another long wait. Really don't plan on coming back........,2.76,2.76,2.512,1.7640000000000002,2.76
579,Deira R.,South San Francisco  CA,0,7,,2015-08-29,1.0,I would come here with my best friend and family all the time but their service is just awful. The last 3 times I was there. Again 3 times in a row we waited for an hour for our meal and another 45 minutes for a dessert after we complained about the service . keep in mind the restaurant wasn't even busy. the food is cold by the time we got it which sucks because we already waited an hour for our food. Just no I don't know what else to say.,2.6,2.75,2.512,1.8600000000000003,2.6900000000000004

However the service here is probably the worse I\'ve ever seen. I took my mom here for lunch during a week day and we got seated pretty quickly. The host said Mark or Matt or something would be our server  we waited for about 15 min for him to at least ask if we wanted something to drink but instead he went to a table that got seated ten minutes after us. I made eye contact and said ""excuse me"" where he then LOOKED AT ME AND THEN LOOKED AWAY. I waited for him to finish taking their order but instead of coming over to us  he left. WOW!! I can understand if it was a busy day  but it wasn\'t  I can understand if it was loud and he didn\'t hear me....but it wasn\'t. Like I said I dont expect much   I just expect them to do their jobs. So we walked out and went to five guys in the food court and got ten times better service than both times I\'ve been to BJ\'s.",2.48,2.75,2.508,1.924,2.6420000000000003

558,Norm D.,San Francisco  CA,54,130,415.0,2015-09-05,2.0,Located within the Tanforan Shopping Center next to Barnes and Nobles Books. Came in here with a friend to have a few beers  food  and some conversation. Wasn't very crowded in the middle of the day in a busy shopping center. The layout of the restaurant is similar to all the other BJ's I've ever been at in Northern California. We sat in the bar area and ordered their hefeweizen beer and some appetizers. We ordered their Chicken Wings (with the hot sauce on the side)  the Pepperoni Extreme flatbread pizza  and their Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. It had twice cooked shredded pork  roasted green chili sauce and jack and cheddar cheese  and was topped with freshly chopped onions and cilantro. Frankly  the Carnitas Fries was not very good in my opinion  as it was rather bland and the shredded carnitas themselves were disappointing. Service was reasonable  but we had to ask for small individual serving plates and silverware. It's what I expected from BJ's  a chain brewery hangout. Wasn't bad  but wasn't great. It is what is is  hit and miss.,2.2,2.71,2.496,2.152,2.5060000000000002

Jimmy absolutely made our evening with his skill and kindness. In talking my husband mentioned my birthday was last week and Jimmy gave us a celebratory pizookie a-la-mode! I had no idea what this was  but it sounded absolutely delicious (amaze-balls) and we truly appreciated the gesture. Three cheers for BJ's San Bruno - especially Jimmy!

317,Kanoa U.,South San Francisco  CA,99,85,362.0,2015-09-18,2.0,"I\'ve been there a few times a typically they are fine. But I ordered their kale and Brussel sprouts salad and it just had the Brussel sprouts in it (with other things) but when I told the waiter that they didn\'t have any kale in this just lettuce and arugula  the waiter assured me that the arugula was their kale. In what world is arugula kale? I was so shocked by his genuine response that I couldn\'t even argue with him. Somehow he genuinely convinced my friend that I ate with. When he left I pulled out my phone to show my friend what kale actually looks like and what arugula looks like. Anyways maybe I\'m making a bigger deal out of this than I should... But if I order a specific salad  I\'m hoping to get what\'s on it. That wasn\'t really what made this a 2. The pizza was really bland. It was their ""most popular"" combo one we ordered. I love pizza  and I actually try not to judge a place too hard on it  although I\'ve had decent pizza from BJ\'s before. That was the most disappointing part. Not sure what\'s going on over there but I hope they can turn it around. If you\'re going to grab a beer and watch the game  then it\'s probably fine  otherwise maybe just stick to their pizookies (pazookie... Or however you spell it). #Disappointed",2.28,2.66,2.48,2.088,2.508
496,Kay M.,Santa Barbara  CA,0,11,3.0,2015-09-18,3.0,I come here often out of convenience and its late hours however  the service is just ok when sitting in the dining area. My boyfriend and I prefer to sit at the bar  the service is better your food comes out faster and you've got drinks in front of you to make it all 100 times better. As much as I would love to give this place 5 stars for being that convenient  awesome  I'm obsessed  I can't. PS DO NOT ORDER THE GOURMET MAC N CHEESE (it was less than half a cup of microwaved hard rotini noodles slopped with bread crumbs and bac) my advice is make your own at home and it will probably come out way better,2.28,2.68,2.488,2.284,2.52

740,Krystal M.,El Monte  CA,11,27,18.0,2015-09-22,1.0,My friends and I came here for a birthday celebration so we needed a table for 6. They told us there would be a 45 minute wait so we walked around the bookstore next door. We waited for about 20 minutes and our table was ready so that was a great start. Unfortunately  our waiter wasn't social and we would have to ask for refills constantly. Once we got our food  one of us got a dirty spoon. We just had to constantly ask for everything and the waiter wasn't checking up on us. We had to ask different waiters and waitresses. Overall  the food was good but the service was not great. Also  we told them it was one of our friend's birthday and they forgot. We also had to split checks and that was the worst thing ever! We took about 30 minutes because then the waiter split up the checks wrong and it was just horrible. Then we were fed up so the manager came and fixed everything. This was such a horrible experience.,2.08,2.64,2.488,2.18,2.4160000000000004
173,Scott P.,Los Altos  CA,170,726,509.0,2015-09-25,2.0,Full disclosure  never a big fan of this chain  but went with a group from work despite my misgivings.I moderately enjoyed my one beer  their porter. Everything we ordered arrived at wildly different times and was delivered at a snail's pace.When we wanted the check split up  the server proceeded to complain about how difficult that would be for him. Our immediate reply was: every other place can do it. The server disappeared and the manager had to come take over. I didn't like that the server punted us to the manager instantly. We were nice and willing to assist the server in dividing the bill but he was not interested in communicating. The manager did manage to smooth things over  but I am still puzzled as to what the big deal was about?,2.04,2.64,2.488,2.2800000000000002,2.4000000000000004
484,Kjeld P.,San Francisco  CA,74,8,,2015-09-28,4.0,I'm writing this because this place doesn't deserve a 2.5 stars rating. I think the expectations for it  is high  because the way the place looks  and a bit on the prices you expect maybe a little more. Most complaints have being on the waiting time and on the food not being close to the amount it costs  their prices are on the 10 20s range  the salads could be less  and cost the same amount of the burgers. I always went with a burger and a beer  and left satisfied  if their selection has fewer things they could maybe get a better rating.I never had the waiting be too long  maybe came here on a weekday and lucked out.But again if you compare a 2.5 star place with this you know this is better  and I'm happy to have it as an option as there aren't many places like it around.As for the people running  -less on the menu  make it tastier  fresher-keep the good waiters  they have them  be more efficient on unattended tables.,2.0,2.67,2.5,2.48,2.402

467,Jeremy O.,Mountain View  CA,1,15,,2015-10-03,4.0,I eat here very regularly like probably twice a month. The only reason I do not give five stars is I have had subpar service once but usually the service is great. I love the food here. The Baked Beignet I think its called is great for dessert. They have awesome ribs here. They make great pizza. Drinks are all good. I highly recommend this place and I am actually surprised it does not have better reviews overall. This place is definitely a lot better than the two stars I see a lot of people giving them. Maybe not worth five stars but definitely 3 to 4 stars. Kind of feel when I read people's reviews that have been here multiple times they obviously like the food but get one subpar experience and only do a review then.,2.16,2.67,2.508,2.416,2.466
585,Jen C.,San Diego  CA,0,17,1.0,2015-10-04,1.0,We were turned off by the slow service. Waited forever for our food  and did not receive any updates from the server in regards to the delay. She seemed more interested in one of the male servers than in her customers. I kept seeing her just standing there talking with this one guy  which is cool if you would have taken care of your customers first. My pizza was served cold and not even cut through into slices.,2.16,2.63,2.504,2.052,2.442

The buffalo wings are the best.First time I went  the waiter was absolutely terrible. I don't remember his name but he literally looked completely out of it. (-1 for that)Second time  the waiter was much better. He was helpful and nice. It was around 10pm when I came with my family and I was really happy to see that people didn't look annoyed that they were working a night shift.

But with beer. Delicious  glorious beer. BJs (and just try to type that without laughing) is incredible. The beer is cold and refreshing. The pizza is served on a spaceship.

Why do I keep making the same mistake?! Here are my issues:- I ordered one of the lunch specials. It came with a salad of your choice plus a personal one topping pizza. When I started to eat the Caesar salad  the lettuce was wilted  rotten  soggy  and not crisp. Yum. Wtf?! So I sent it back. When I received it the second time  there was no difference. And by that time  I was over it. My pizza was honestly whatever. - My mom ordered the chicken wings. They were SALTY AF and way overcooked and dry.- My boyfriend ordered the BBQ plate  which isn't even worth reviewing. The fries were the best part.-The service still sucks.

316,Johnny B.,Reno  NV,57,352,73.0,2015-10-13,2.0,I've never been so disappointed in service at a BJ's brewery as I have when visiting this location. It took over an hour to get our food from when we placed our order. We watched other people that arrived and ordered after us receive their food which was really frustrating. Had we lived in this town we would have just left and not waited. Unfortunately  we were from out of town and weren't familiar with the area which is what brought us here in the first place. I will give credit where credit is due  the manager did come out and at least acknowledge that it was an unreasonable amount of time that we waited for our food. He offered us a Pizookie on the house  I countered with what I thought was a fair resolution and he obliged. The food was still decent  once it finally arrived. Saved them from a 1 star review. I won't ever return to this BJ's.,2.08,2.6,2.504,2.408,2.3920000000000003

Recommend only coming for happy hour and for sports games. ALSO! shots are overpriced  mixed drinks aren't so bad. Definitely  you are better off just getting beers $4 dollar happy hour $6 dollars regular price. Their seasonal beers are usually really good so please don't forget to ask  you may miss out on something great.,2.16,2.62,2.512,2.38,2.436

The host was non friendly. Our waiter was nice enough but slow with our order and revising out table. This is all forgivable. The problem was the food. Everything was overcooked. Out calamari came out dark brown and super crisp. Then our chowder came out watery. Then the ribs came out overcooked and dry. And last our dessert the cookie came out overcooked and hard to get out the pan. We complained to the manager who was very apologetic but this did not change the quality of the food.

318,Maria C.,San Francisco  CA,96,14,6.0,2015-10-17,4.0,I see this place has got some not-so-hot reviews. I've always had a good experience here; but I feel like you gotta know some things. 1st this place is ALWAYS busy! So if you come during regular hours or with a big party  expect to wait. I generally come here with my BF and we always come after 9pm. We've never had to wait for a table. 2nd we almost always order the same thing: avocado egg rolls  the BJ's Classic pizza and the Southern Fried chicken; we've never been disappointed!If you know when to come and what to order  this place is pretty good!!,2.4,2.66,2.524,2.416,2.556
544,Vinnie P.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,,2015-10-18,1.0,Still crapy service and terrible customer treatment. Walked in today at 4:50pm and stood right in front of the Spanish guy working at the hosting station and for 2 or 3 minutes and never even acknowledged me. Thought I'd try them again since the last review and never even made it to the table this time. I will never ever go back to BJ's in San Bruno again as long as I live and will inform everyone I know!,2.4,2.66,2.512,2.212,2.556
528,William A.,Juneau  AK,7,32,1.0,2015-10-21,2.0,The service was slow and very generic. It took 15 minutes to get water served after we sat down. The wait staff who served us were pretty mechanical and not very engaging. This is the 2nd time I've tried their beer and it was flat and warm again. The atmosphere is decent but I can't say the experience either time was enjoyable. I'll be steering clear of this brand from here on out ,2.32,2.66,2.512,2.44,2.524
287,Discourser T.,Daly City  CA,1,32,,2015-10-25,1.0,"My wife and I stopped to grab an early dinner on October 25. After a brief wait  we were seated in the back room. Our server appeared and said he would be with us in a few minutes. No big deal since we were both looking at the menu. He came back about five minutes later saying he was going to check on our drinks. I looked up at an obviously ""high"" employee and informed him we hadn\'t ordered anything. He mumbled something and left  returning a few minutes later with napkins for drinks. We ordered two waters and an iced tea. Since we were ready to order our meal we went ahead. We ordered tomato bisque in a bread bowl  an arugula beet salad  a flat bread pizza  and Mediterranean chicken tacos. Five minutes later an expediter arrived with a bowl of tomato bisque and a visibly dirty spoon. A second expediter arrived in the heels of the first with our salad. I was slightly irritated that our order was wrong. Mind you  I had heard the three surrounding tables complain that their orders were wrong as well. The manager had already come over to smooth over issues at one table. My wife could not get our server\'s attention and went to the bar to get an employee. The employee tracked down the manager who never was able to find our table. In the meantime  our ""high"" server made it to our table where I explained what we had ordered  requested it be filled correctly  and to bring clean silverware. By that time we were both frustrated with the lack of ability to take and fulfill an order  being waited on by a clearly intoxicated employee  and the failure of the manager to come to our table after being requested not once but twice by the same employee. We left our table and informed the host stand of why we were leaving. Not so much as effort to get the manager. It would appear this is a regular occurrence. This BJ\'s has been a toilet for some time and I will never step foot in this one again. I will also alert anyone who is interested in the pathetic service and poor cleanliness of this location.",2.32,2.65,2.504,2.308,2.518
518,Alexis I.,Inner Sunset  San Francisco  CA,174,11,2.0,2015-10-26,2.0,Dirty plates. Dirty utensils. Dirty table. Smh. Had to ask 4 different workers for new plates and utensils. Asked 3 different workers to wipe down our table. The food was okay though.,2.36,2.66,2.5,2.408,2.54
775,Nicole V.,San Juan Capistrano  CA,0,4,,2015-10-27,5.0,I ordered a cheeseburger and it was delicious! Our server was so kind and willing to make our dining experience memorable. I got the Irish root beer  which is Irish whiskey  root beer  and Irish cream all in a big chilled mug. Its to die for. I will definitely be back to this restaurant and recommend tit to my family and friends. Thanks guys!,2.48,2.69,2.516,2.7399999999999998,2.606
233,Fiona B.,San Francisco  CA,1,45,109.0,2015-10-27,3.0,Walked in and staffs was kind of talking amongst themselves  they saw me but didn't say anything. Same time  a family of 3 came in  they were slow to greet them as well  but they were seated first even though I came in before them. This guy seated us  walked reallllllllllllly slow and allllllllllllllll the way to the back even though the front had seats  and our section smelled like garbage.Service was slow  waited 8 minutes til a waitress came to give us the menu and ask what we would like to drink. Another 5 minutes pass  we ordered. Waited for 15 to 20 minutes for the food and the food was just okay. . . Couldn't wave down any other waiter to get the bill. I don't know if I'll ever go back  unless if friends go there or I'm desperate ,2.48,2.71,2.524,2.412,2.6180000000000003
295,Natali R.,Daly City  CA,9,52,9.0,2015-10-28,4.0,My boyfriend  dog  and I go here very often as it is close to his home and it has outdoor seating with a fire pit and heater lamps.Food is always good. I love that they have a late happy hour. I enjoy their avocado egg rolls and craft beers (Jeremiah Red is a good one). Staff is mostly friendly but not always. Depends on who you get. Our food and beverages arrive in a timely manner. On one occasion  my boyfriend and I went alone and sat inside. We ordered a pizza and a couple beers. The chef comes out a few moments later to explain that his staff burned our pizza just a little bit on one of the edges. He said that he is making a brand new one himself and that he did not want to send something unacceptable out. Wow! We were impressed. He said they would offer us a discount for the delay. Great  thanks! We probably would have taken the slightly burned pizza  but it was nice to know he cared!I would hate to ever run into a problem here  because I love it!,2.6,2.74,2.536,2.512,2.684
302,Francisco G.,San Francisco  CA,46,53,1.0,2015-11-03,1.0,Hella expensive  rude service  just straight shit.Unless you want a cold burger and cold fries for $50 bucks I recommend McDonalds.It's like they just stopped trying and knew you would pay just on location alone. I mean they don't even wipe the tables off anymore.,2.52,2.71,2.532,2.18,2.6340000000000003
715,Jansine G.,San Francisco  CA,106,6,3.0,2015-11-03,3.0,Service is sooooo bad at night! It isn't even that busy but they take forever to serve. I'm usually just here for the drinks because food is ok.,2.6,2.7,2.54,2.348,2.66
297,Jeff S.,San Francisco  CA,0,44,,2015-11-04,2.0,This place has really gone downhill. Seems like management has lost control of their staff or they haven't trained them properly. The wait times for food are ridiculous lately and the last time i was there they completely screwed up our orders.I always get great service at the bar though.,2.6,2.68,2.54,2.408,2.648
504,Marcus F.,Daly City  CA,307,4,17.0,2015-11-04,3.0,I usually like the food here but today it was just ok. First of all they took one of my favs off the menu the shrimp scampi. Second  I ordered the deep dish ziti and it looked like a flat bread pizza in a deep dish container. It was tasty but not nearly what I expected or what it looked like on the menu. Lastly and what topped it off  my sister ordered a portobello and asparagus salad  instead of getting portobellos she got white mushrooms and didn't bother telling her! Luckily we all noticed and they did get the right mushrooms but gave a lame ass excuse for not putting the right mushrooms on in the first place. It wasn't a total loss though. We got $50 off from the rewards points and the baked beignet was pretty good,2.56,2.66,2.536,2.508,2.62
445,Silvia B.,San Francisco  CA,0,6,,2015-11-04,2.0,This used to be one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants. The past couple of times we have gone the brought the wrong order to our table and we had to wait almost an hour for a hamburger while all the people around us got their food right away. The waiters don't seem to be as attentive as before. I wonder if the Manager has changed? services seems to be going downhill for sure!,2.52,2.66,2.54,2.472,2.604
542,Michelle A.,Pacifica  CA,0,15,4.0,2015-11-06,2.0,Sad. Waited for our drink order. Husband likes IPA. Server comes back and says they are out so H orders a different one. Server comes back  now they are out of all tap IPAs. Really!?! On Friday night? H gets a bottled beer. He asks for a glass. When it comes the outside is dirty. We then order food and a salad. Wait wait wait. Salad finally comes  then we get our food 2 minutes later. The bill comes promptly of course. On our way out we see the happy hour sign. Beers should have been $1 off each one. But it just wasn't worth the hassle. First and LAST time there. Stay away from this awful service. The food was fine but extremely overpriced.,2.44,2.65,2.544,2.44,2.566
401,Alan S.,Redwood Shores  CA,66,58,69.0,2015-11-06,1.0,Went to BJ's at 1pm on a Friday. Not busy at all  and we were seated promptly. Things kind of went downhill from there. Tried to order a Coke  but they don't serve Coca-cola products. Ordered a root beer  and was told the taps were broken(?). Finally able to get an iced tea. Ordered a bison burger and chicken flatbread. Items took a bit long to arrive  esp considering the place was not busy (I'm guessing it was 20 min?). Then the topper: the server delivered my meal  but then proceeded to pull a hair out from the burger. Yep. I guess it was good that he spotted it  and he did ask the kitchen to re-make the order  but it was pretty gross... Burger was delivered a few minutes later by the manager (why did it get delivered so quickly this time?)  but kind of lost my appetite at that point. Took forever to get the check (server seemed to be talking with another customer throughout our time at the restaurant). When the check arrived  we expected the burger to have been taken off the menu at least  but instead  we were charged TWICE for the order. Finally able to get the second charge taken off but no offer to take off the first or even an apology from the manager.I have thought long and hard about writing this review  especially given the rating  but I think it's completely appropriate given my experience this time  and the 3 other times I've attempted to give BJ's a shot (two other times at the Foster City location  another time here). Every time I've had either lost/wrong order  slow service  food return  etc. I don't consider myself picky  but just not acceptable. Message to BJ's: you are really a disaster. Maybe I've been very unlucky  but I'm not coming back here again and recommending against anyone ever wanting to go there. Your prices put you in competition with places that offer far better quality of food and customer service. I hope you figure it out for the sake of the longevity of your company  but it will not be with my support.,2.44,2.61,2.544,2.308,2.542
541,Teri C.,San Bruno  CA,130,10,5.0,2015-11-06,5.0,We were part of a large group tonight with about 20 people  including 3 children. I was impressed with our server  her name is Eva. She did everything that she could to accommodate our large party. Some of us arrived late and she rushed our additional food orders. I will definitely return to BJ's! ! The service was great tonight! I asked to speak with the Manager so that I could provide this feedback and he arrived at our table within a minute and asked if we needed anything. Great service and great food! ! Kudos to our awesome server --- thanks Eva for awesome customer service !!,2.6,2.61,2.56,2.7399999999999998,2.606
539,Samantha A.,San Mateo  CA,0,4,1.0,2015-11-08,2.0,I went here a few weeks ago with my friend. I rated this 2 stars because the service wasn't great. They were slow at getting our food and check. They brought my friend the wrong drink also  and our server was no where around. Needless to say we had about three different servers. On the bright side the food was pretty good,2.52,2.62,2.564,2.3120000000000003,2.58
308,Riana C.,San Francisco  CA,243,196,14.0,2015-11-09,4.0,The food is standard BJs.This location seems to be consistently busy so make reservations!Had something happen with one of the orders in our large group  but management handled the situation very very well. Great to see customer service as a priority and management that takes the time to reach out to clients.,2.6,2.61,2.576,2.544,2.606
755,Joylne C.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,2015-11-11,5.0,Two thumbs up for our server Edward  he was very attentive at our lunch yesterday. My father has Celiac and can't have any gluten and when we let our server know this he was very attentive and followed our order from start to finish. Many times the server will take your order and someone else delivers it. Not Edward  he made sure my father was well taken care of. Thank you Edward.,2.6,2.65,2.584,2.644,2.63
739,James L.,Bridgewater  NJ,1,6,,2015-11-12,5.0,Came here for lunch and sat at the bar. My day is done so I decided to have the Oasis Amber with the Chicken Club. Not to sound trite  but this lunch was easily one of the top 5 lunches I have ever had. The sandwich had so much flavor that I questioned whether this was a chain or a single restaurant. I can't recall ever having such good food from a restaurant chain before. Take note Fridays and Ruby Tuesdays  should a BJs open on your block! As for the Oasis Amber it hit the right sultry amber note with a moderate to heavy touch of carbonation; perfect for washing down a burger  pizza or in my case  an amazing chicken club. Service at the bar was friendly and professional  complete with the witty banter that makes the bar experience better than a lonely table. Living in NJ I was pleased to read that a location up north in NY opened just this year  about an hour drive from my home. I am looking forward to showing this place off to my wife and friends.,2.76,2.65,2.6,2.516,2.694
386,Marcela M.,Daly City  CA,0,15,1.0,2015-11-13,1.0,Very bad service. Ask for a little something for a friend that was his birthday took them 40 min to come to us and to top it off told us they don't do those things in there. We had about 4 different people in our table. Servers need more training. He was really worry about us paying the check and forgot about providing a decent service. After I talked to the manager which was really nice and hope they will something about it. Don't plane to go back any time soon.,2.72,2.65,2.6,2.084,2.678
424,Sonny Q.,South San Francisco  CA,0,77,17.0,2015-11-16,1.0,Ordered avocado roll  spinach artichoke dip and fried calamari. Got the spinach (bland) and calamari (average). After a few minutes they brought us a wrong order for the avocado roll. Name of server is Alexis. I end up having the avocado roll for To go. We ordered also hot green tea and raspberry ice tea. When we got green tea  it was warm & on a mug. Usually they give you an envelope of the tea & hot water. Alexis probably just re warm the mug after we complain. Also I asked for refill of my raspberry tea & she just added water over it or the refill tank for the tea was empty. Poor quality of service. We were suppose to get entry food but end up going home. Try Jack's across the street or Crepevine in Burlingame next time.,2.64,2.61,2.588,2.116,2.622
505,Tajanee D.,San Francisco  CA,0,10,6.0,2015-11-16,1.0,Came to BJS last night for dinner with my baby and friend. I will first begin by staying I have been to BJS on multiple occasions. But this experience was by far the worse. I always get the same thing: Shrimp and Fettuccine Alfredo  but this time it was different. The Alfredo sauce was not creamy at all  it was very very watery. Usually that have a while grilled chicken breast slices on the side but this time it was chicken chunks in it that tasted like something out of a frozen TV dinner. I had to wait 15 minute for a waiter to even come say Welcome to BJS would you like a drink ? Then an additional 10 minutes for some type of silverware. Every Time the waiter came he left before I could finish what I was saying  sometimes in the middle of it. We waited forever for a salad  forever for our dinner  for ever for water  forever for him to get dirty dishes. The service was horrible. I have them 1 star because the garlic knots  my friends steak dinner & our desserts were delicious (minus the they were too heavy with the salt on the Salted Caramel Pizzooke. It was super crowded as always but since we called ahead we were seated promptly but that wouldn't matter based on how slow the service was. DIM after he gave us our bills he apologized for the service because he was working two sections? Too late for that buddy. I'll probably come back if I'm desperate but no more pasta ... AT ALL.,2.52,2.57,2.584,2.116,2.55
443,Kelley w.,Pacifica  CA,17,24,24.0,2015-11-17,5.0,I don't know why people bash this place. It's pretty cool with a large menu and TVs everywhere. 5 stars for a nice clean bar and great job from Keith made my meal great.,2.68,2.61,2.6,2.612,2.638
151,Mike C.,San Francisco  CA,596,1015,3705.0,2015-11-17,4.0,Echoing a lot of Cherylynn N's sentiments (yelp.com/user_details?us) on chain restaurants  I tempered my expectations on a recent weekday lunch here. Arriving around 11:30 am  the spacious restaurant was already about 1/3rd full with most diners in the bar area. There are no shortages of televisions so I can imagine the vibe on game days or game nights; in fact  a friend shared that he had a ball watching the NBA Finals here in June. After checking in  we were guided to a booth in the center dining area. The menu is pretty large so  being my first time here  I quickly a checked the Yelp highlights for ideas. Here's what I had and shared: Shared appetizers1) Potato skins (yelp.com/user_local_phot) -2) Fried calamari (yelp.com/user_local_phot) -Entre3) Turkey  ham  and bacon sandwich with side of fries (yelp.com/user_local_phot) and a bowl of chili (yelp.com/user_local_phot) -I also started with a strawberry lemonade (yelp.com/user_local_phot) which hit the spot. At $3.25 with refills  this also was a deal.The food was okay and better than average for the price. My friend enjoyed her clam chowder and deep dish pepperoni pizza which I will try next time. The two apps for two people with entrees were a bit much for us. She took home about half of the calamari and I did the same with the potato skins. There were a couple of service inconsistencies that dampened our experience. Perhaps because we were slow in finishing our apps  the entrees came before we finished our bowls of soup which made the table very small. Also  in trying to hail our waitress Jacqueline  we had a difficult time finding her as it seemed that she was busy somewhere else. Looked like she was doing a solo for our area  the window sections had two waiters tending those customers. Might consider the business flow in assigning the staff.Overall  it wasn't a bad experience  a bit cheaper than Jack's  but with a larger selection of food. Most of my Yelp friends gave two or three stars  but maybe I was just fortunate to catch them on a good day!,2.68,2.64,2.6,2.384,2.656
501,Michelle B.,Daly City  CA,3,34,86.0,2015-11-20,1.0,Friendly staff but horrible ticket times. Not even a sorry your shot is taking 20 minutes. Food is great but not worth the wait. Prices are booboo  too. Go to Elephant Bar in Serremonte. More for your money and time.,2.64,2.61,2.6,2.084,2.622

161,Brenda L.,San Francisco  CA,392,320,765.0,2015-12-01,3.0,This place falls right in the middle for me. Good for their craft beers and other selections on tap. Multiple screens to view the games and a good sized bar area (which is first come first serve). They also run certain hh specials during major televised games and parking isn't an issue (located in the tanforan shopping plaza)There really aren't many sports bar options around the area so it's probably your best bet after buffalo wild wings.The food is average - similar to an applebees. The quality is a hit or miss. The wings were fresh out the fryer one time I went and another time it was dry as cardboard. The clam chowder in the bread bowl was delicious - not the best clam chowder but definitely the best bread bowl I've had - baked with garlic butter - mmm. Skip the flatbreads - I've yet to find one that tastes good. The fries are thin shoe string fries - not my thing. The spinach artichoke dip was eh - the cheese looked like ricotta/ chunky and not really melted. Their craft brews are good - I like the hefeweisen and berry burst cider - the best thing is you can get a beer sampler which comes in 4 small flights - if you like variety this is a great option to sample 4 of their craft beers.The service has always been great so no complaints there. The multiple tv screen set up is pretty nice as well. Overall a good place to a grab a drink and watch the game. Don't set your expectations too high on the food however.,2.8,2.6,2.588,2.38,2.68
734,David B.,San Francisco  CA,0,3,,2015-12-02,1.0,I have been here a few times and the service has gotten worse each time. This time was the last. 30 min to take an order  when the food comes out it was wrong and cold. The manager was nice enough to comp our meal.

175,Leslie C.,San Francisco  CA,26,84,1273.0,2015-12-03,3.0,This BJs is at Tanforan mall. It's a nice restaurant with a lot of TVs but the service is extremely slow. I ordered chicken wings ahead of time through their mobile app but still had to wait an hour for it after being seated. It was hard to get the waiter's attention to order our dinner and again for drinks. This BJs is a major disappointment.,2.64,2.59,2.576,2.444,2.6100000000000003
309,Tyler H.,San Francisco  CA,192,130,6.0,2015-12-04,2.0,It had been a bucket list item of mine to actually visit a BJ's  and I'm beyond disappointed.Our server meant well  but was just inexperienced and poorly trained. Took a long time to take our order  bring us drinks  etc. It was the middle of the day  not too busy and I was in a party of six.They completely forgot the order of a college. By the time his food came out we had all finished. Even after we paid  all of our dirty dishes were still our table and it was just a mess. We walked away and saw the dirty dishes piled up from the people next to us who were leaving as we sat down. Such a poor experience. I'd rather go to Subway.,2.56,2.57,2.58,2.3120000000000003,2.566

418,Rick K.,Sunnyvale  CA,14,104,33.0,2015-12-07,2.0,"Been to the bar here many times for sports events. Never had a problem. Dining at this location has always been a crap shoot. Last night\'s experience was no different.  BJ\'s is ""churn and burn"". Servers are young and often inattentive. They attempt to take your entire order  stack each course up on the table before you\'ve had a chance to enjoy or barely taste your appetizer  salad or soup. There were 4 of us this evening and no one got a refill  2nd beer  ice tea  etc without first flagging down a staff member who then called our server. Being familiar with this style of service  I simply don\'t order all at once which forces the server to space the courses out a bit and actually allows us to enjoy the food. It wasn\'t a Friday evening with a long wait. There were several empty tables in our server\'s station and he could have done a little better. Our appetizers were tasty  but my wife\'s Asparagus salad didn\'t come with its asparagus. We mentioned it... but it never came. Another member in our party never got her salad either. Once again  we mentioned it  but it too  never came.In the end  a manager ended up crediting us for about 1/3 of our bill. We didn\'t ask for this  but clearly he was aware of the mistakes  which didn\'t seem to stop. We skipped dessert.",2.76,2.6,2.6,2.3440000000000003,2.664

I never do Yelp reviews  but this was enough to make me write one. At around 9:15pm  my boyfriend and I walked into BJ\'s  hoping to get a simple takeout of appetizers. I should\'ve spotted a red flag when the total for 3 appetizers came up to $40. We waited about 20 mins for our food  and as we check the food before we leave - we realize we got the Sriracha bacon mac n cheese  when we specifically told the guy we wanted the appetizer one. My boyfriend hates Sriracha (I know  right?). Guess the guy couldn\'t figure out where the option for mac n cheese was on the register  so he just took the closest one. They also never informed us that the appetizer gourmet mac n cheese was removed from the menu. We return the mac n cheese  only to see there was nothing on our sliders except the beef + the bun. No tomato. No onion. Nothing. All the while  employees are on their phones  gossiping. I\'ve worked in retail/customer service  and no supervisor of mine would tolerate having a phone out during shift or not keeping busy in some way. When the sliders came back  there was cheese  but nothing else on them - that alone took 15 minutes. The employee then told us  ""The chefs do what the chefs do."" After waiting for an hour and receiving no apology  we left very disappointed.",2.8,2.59,2.604,2.116,2.6739999999999995
706,Rob G.,San Diego  CA,3,7,,2015-12-10,1.0,We ordered a pizooki for takeout. The guy took my name and said it would be 10 minutes. I sat down right in front of him. Twenty five minutes later  I ask him what happened and he says wait a minute and takes the pizooki out of the refrigerator and hands it to me. HORRIBLE SERVICE. No apology either.,2.76,2.55,2.592,2.244,2.6339999999999995
278,Chris L.,Portland  OR,96,623,28.0,2015-12-11,2.0,Ugh  why did we come here after seeing the Yelp reviews. Probably because there wasn't anything else better at the mall. Anyway  the menu is huge and truly impossible to navigate & decide on what to get. Ultimately I opted for just a basic burger  which was just meh. The side salad was actually pretty tasty  but that did not make up for the mediocre foods nor the sub-par burger. A silver lining is the baked cookie with ice cream (I called these skillet cookies)  which was quite tasty. But I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.,2.8,2.52,2.596,2.472,2.632
382,Michael K.,Honolulu  HI,39,45,,2015-12-17,1.0,Waited over an hour for our food tonight. Unacceptable when you have a hungry toddler. Yet could have at least gotten her food out first. When our food got here  they forgot my wife's pizza. Waited another 20 min and still no pizza. We decided to leave without it. Asked for water. Never got it. The thing that kills me is all the servers walk around like they don't care. They don't care that you've been waiting over an hour for your food and it shows in their demeanor. If i could  id give this place zero stars. Don't waste your hard earned money here.,2.64,2.52,2.596,2.404,2.568
108,Lin Z.,San Mateo  CA,140,96,285.0,2015-12-24,3.0,The service at BJs often leaves something to be desired. However  their happy hour is good! 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas is a good deal. Though this isn't really actual deep dish pizza  I still like the pizza here. Happy hour does start at weird times though  it's more like happy late hour for me because I usually can only go to the one that starts late at 10p. The menu is pretty big but we'll usually get some combination of the following  all of which I'd recommend: crisp potato skins platter  calamari  BJ's classic combo pizza  and the Great White pizza. I've also gotten the Twisted BLT salad  which comes with spinach. Actually  that salad makes me feel a little less guilty about eating at BJ's late at night because I'll have it with a few slices of pizza. All in all  BJ's is a good place to come hang out and get a beer and some decent food with friends.,2.68,2.51,2.604,2.732,2.5780000000000003
288,Kai S.,Daly City  CA,90,97,18.0,2015-12-29,4.0,I've given this place a lot more chances lately & I honestly feel like the way that this place is set up now a days is so much better than it was in the past. I've received great service one evening from Camila R. and another from the server Tyler in the last couple of months. Their service alone made me completely want to change my review on yelp from one star to a whopping 4 star review. Whenever I was seated  it did not take more than 10 minutes to wait  the food came out as fast as possible  and I felt very attended to while I was dining once with my best friend  and once with my entire family. Both experiences were great! I've stuck with the same dish for the longest time: Parmesan Crusted Chicken with Garlic Mashed Potatoes & Broccoli & i always get the pizzookie trio at the end of my meals  especially to share. I've not once in the last few times I've come here felt like my food was subpar or there was anything wrong with it. My only complaint would be a question  WHY TAKE OUT THE BAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE SIDE :'( I loved getting that to pair with my meals  but I'll definitely live without it haha. I just was sad to see that it wasn't on the menu anymore. Besides that small factor  I'm very pleased with how my service was at this location and look forward to the next time I go to BJ's in San Bruno!,2.68,2.51,2.604,2.768,2.5780000000000003
668,Briana M.,San Francisco  CA,2,8,,2015-12-29,1.0,Terrible. Worst Service I've ever had. Our waitress was not attentive at all and gave me attitude when I asked for another salad ( I ordered unlimited soup and salad).

162,Aaron M.,San Francisco  CA,296,758,78.0,2015-12-31,4.0,"My parade of positive reviews of chain restaurants continues! Look  BJs has great pizza  and decent beer  and it\'s open even after your movie on the other end of the mall. The avocado egg rolls and the tuna poke are great too. If you order anything else you\'re really gambling and I don\'t know why you\'re doing it (or why they even let you  to be honest). Also  if you decide to (or have to) wait for a real table here  it could be awhile - snag seats at the bar if possible.The vegetarian toppings for the pizza are especially tasty  namely the ""seasoned tomatoes"" which is really just like the best chunky tomato sauce you\'ve ever had.  Mushrooms and black olives also work well.Oh! And they have an after-work happy hour on Fridays  a late happy hour after 10pm Sundays  and BOTH of them every other day of the week except Saturday when you get none. The mini pizzas and beers (which are the only things you should be getting here anyway) are heavily discounted. Do it.",2.48,2.54,2.608,2.7359999999999998,2.516
260,Linda N.,San Francisco  CA,124,506,,2016-01-01,2.0,Lukewarm avocado egg roll appetizer that was probably placed in the microwave before being brought to the table. Lukewarm pizza supposedly straight from the oven. How can the pan be hot yet the cheese on the pizza is barely melted? All the toppings would fall off each time a slice was taken from the pan. The only thing that was at the correct temperature was my wedge salad. -__-I've been here many times and I don't remember the food ever being this bad. Perhaps everyone was hungover from nye celebrations? Service was alright for the most part. Worst $40 spent on a meal to start 2016.,2.52,2.55,2.612,2.568,2.5380000000000003
254,J L.,Fremont  CA,25,27,4.0,2016-01-04,1.0,"Second visit to this location.  First was okay  food wise  but service was below part  but first day on the job. This visit  I would question if ANYONE working here has ever been in food service before.  What kind of ""Hostess"" puts a party of 10 in a section where the Wait Staff has been working one day? Adding auto tip for ""large party"" seems like just another was to scam consumers. Doesn\'t it matter that TIP IS FOR SERVICE not an automatic ""gift""? Especially when the order is wrong TWICE!??!  Auto tipping should be illegal but it does guarantee extra income. Disappointing and costly to say the least!",2.52,2.52,2.608,2.436,2.52
157,Stefany Z.,San Francisco  CA,303,111,188.0,2016-01-05,1.0,"I\'ve been to this BJ\'s location plenty of times but never took the time to review it. However  this past Sunday I experienced the worst customer service I have ever received at a restaurant  it bothered me enough for me to share with everyone. Here\'s why I\'m giving it 1 star after this past visit:1) We waited 40 minutes to get seated on a Sunday night; we were a party of 3.2) Our server  ""ALEXIS C."" looked as grim as ever when greeting us. It was a forced  ""I hate my job"" kind of greeting. From the start I knew it was going to be a bad experience.3) We had to ask our server for everything  including plates for our appetizer  for which she looked bothered when asked.4) THERE WAS AN ANT ON MY PLATE. And the server didn\'t even bother to apologize.Honestly  I always tip regardless of terrible service...but this was just overwhelmingly bad. My friends felt sorry for the girl  so they tipped for our party. That server did not deserve a tip. No matter how shitty things are in your personal life  you\'re at work and if you want to earn a good tip  you should be a good server. Period.",2.52,2.48,2.596,2.436,2.496
431,Christina X.,Millbrae  CA,247,45,11.0,2016-01-05,4.0,great atmosphere! servers are usually super nice and helpful. the seating is super comfy. good place to watch sports! the bar is the best place because the TVs might be hard to see in the regular seating area. The bar is first come first serve so it might be a little hard to find a place to sit on game days. Happy hour is extended when there's a football game on! Great place  but I give it 4 stars because they stopped putting a sugar rim on the cup of my strawberry lemonade.,2.48,2.48,2.604,2.7359999999999998,2.48
241,Carol C.,Newhall  CA,76,17,5.0,2016-01-08,4.0,Me and my friends always have gone to bjs to hangout and celebrate after grueling exams and also just for casual evenings. We have always had great service. So when a family friend wanted to go out for their birthday we suggested this place. When checking in at the front we experienced a customer service hiccup that left us feeling a sour taste in our mouth  but when bringing it to the managers attention he was apologetic and quick to address it. Our waitress Jessica was awesome and so nice ! She was very attentive and always kept us hydrated. The food was good as usual and the best part was that we got to watch the basketball game on top of the birthday dinner. I would go again and would still recommend this place to others :),2.48,2.48,2.6,2.7359999999999998,2.48
399,Bill F.,Burlingame  CA,0,31,,2016-01-13,2.0,I was there early before the lunch hour with a party of 7.  The food was good but the service was poor.1.  After ordering  we had to wait 40 mins before our food arrived. 2.  We had to ask for refills for our drinks.3.  Our glasses were not clean and still had lipstick on some of them.4.  We had to ask for our check twice.It's a great location and I like the interior of the restaurant but service needs to improve.,2.52,2.47,2.588,2.44,2.49
453,Jean Paul D.,Daly City  CA,140,1,,2016-01-14,5.0,"Today was a good day. Rome was not built in one day though if your server\'s name is Leggio you may find yourself in the best seat in the house with classy  friendly service that makes you want to eat as slow as possible. Haha  it was really good service today though. My girlfriend and I had a bogo entree that expires today at 3. We walked in  did not have to wait at all. The hostess carefully walked us down the busy walkway and that\'s when Leggio noticed my awkward gait and offered to seat us in his section. ""VIP"" he adds. He chose to seat us at a large booth that could have accommodated a small family or a group of friends. We had a lot of space which was great for me because I hadn\'t taken my medication yet and my legs were hurting. And so we ordered a Dr pepper and a glass of water which were promptly delivered. We then started with calamari and potato skins. For our entrees we chose the unlimited soup and salad and the portabello burger with thin fries. Before the appetizers came out I finished my doctor pepper and Leggio quickly notices and refills ""back with the doctor"". Just what I ordered. The food was amazing. By far  one of the most memorable experiences at bjs. My baby and I can eat here forever. :) Build dat rome",2.52,2.48,2.592,2.836,2.496
343,Baylie C.,San Carlos  CA,14,15,,2016-01-14,1.0,I've been to this location numerous times  and every time it's been a failure. There's never silverware on the table  and it takes about 15 minutes AFTER your food has arrived to receive any. The front desk people are so unorganized. There will be 3-5 people standing there and they'll do nothing  while 1 employee does all the work. It seems like they hire underage staff who know nothing  just for their looks. (Most of the girls have resting b*tch face) (One girl with a star tattoo on her neck seems to be the only one who knows how to do her job and has customer service skills) I'm absolutely fed up of giving this location chances.,2.52,2.48,2.58,2.308,2.496
85,Henry L.,San Mateo  CA,2301,828,2654.0,2016-01-15,3.0,The wait here is crazy long! Gotta get here early.The inside is decorated pretty well. The staff are young--not exactly experts in what they do  but pretty nice people. The food prices are ok  and the portions are huge. Especially the starter combo--that was a lot of nachos.Overall  a good place to hang out and chill with friends.,2.6,2.5,2.576,2.508,2.54
754,Carolyn S.,New York  NY,2,12,,2016-01-17,1.0,Came here on a Sunday at 5 and the initial interaction with the hostesses who ignored my brother to finish a conversation among themselves for several minutes shoould have been our first clue to not bother- but we ate here anyway. We order food for 3 adults and 1 child. The food comes for the three adults- but not the child. My salad had a huge hair on it  so I immediately send it back with the same person who brought it over. Fast forward 10 minutes- no waitress and no food for myself or my nephew. I ask a waiter to go get our waitress. he returns a couple minutes later and asks what her name is. She never said  so we did not know  but cant you figure that out? She finally comes over- still with no food- and no apology or explanation. I ask for a manager. A woman walks over and is very nice and says she will go check. She walks away and doesnt come back. Now a soup that was also missing arrives- still no salad sans hair  and no kids meal. The missing food finally comes (its been about 20 minutes and the other two adults are basically done eating). Another manager comes over and apologizes  gets us more water (we had needed water for a majority of this time) and makes adjustments to the check while promising our server will be attentive to us the rest of the meal. he was very nice and I appreciated his apology and check adjustment. However the waitress did not come back  and when it was time for the check a waiter comes over and says she has gone on break but he will get the check. Really?? The food was decent but certainly not worth the hassle. As much fun as it is to make a two year old wait for his food for 20 minutes after his parents both have food and to receive a salad with hair in it  Ill pass next time and take my business elsewhere.,2.52,2.48,2.572,2.244,2.496
311,Thomas W.,Pleasanton  CA,0,3,,2016-01-20,5.0,For my first experience at a BJ's restaurant  I could not have asked for a better experience.I went in with an open mind  unlike most first time customers in restaurants these days; however from the moment I sat down until the moment it was time to leave... my expectations could have never been more inaccurate. For me  it's all about the service. I'm a people person  who hates people. Weird right? But like anyone out there  I create a great relationship with someone who shows interest in me and my friends and provides an environment that I feel as comfortable as eating at home in my own living room. My server Chaz  was more than I could ever ask for. I felt as if he was my best friend from the moment we sat down  receiving an oddly-familiarwelcome from a very unfamiliar friend... and I use the term friend loosely because regardless that I had never met him before he left such an impression that I felt inclined to invite him out for a glass of wine with my group after he got off work. He was unusually personable  in a great way  and it was one of the most pleasant experiences I've had at a casual dining restaurant in this area.Bottom Line/TLDR: Go to BJ's in San Bruno and ask for Chaz  and whether you are expecting a fun dining experience or not  you'll definitely get one.,2.68,2.52,2.588,2.676,2.584
677,Mike G.,South San Francisco  CA,0,5,,2016-01-21,2.0,"In May of last year We experienced some rather poor service and issues with our food. At that time the then manager  reached out to us and we noticed that on our next visits things had improved greatly. Although the service continues to be below par  the food is almost always what we expect. This past weekend  We ventured to BJ\'s for lunch before a movie. Walked in  got seated immediately  server quick to the table to take our drink order. Took about 10 minutes to get two beers  which is about the average wait time for drinks there. Ordered our appetizers  the chicken wings with parmesian sauce. Waiter looks at me and says ""how would you like them""? After explaining again  he leaves. Appetizer comes  but wait! No plates  no napkins no utensils. We had to ask for them after we have been at the table for almost 20 minutes. Our food order came in a nice amount of time  but wait  my burger which says it comes with ""special burger sauce"" alas had no sauce!! This is the second time I\'ve ordered the same burger and no sauce!! When I asked about the sauce the waiter said ""Oh do you want some""? Long and short service was about 2.5 out of five  food 3 out of 5  over all I\'ve noticed that the servers don\'t seem to know the menu  they are slow  lots of mangers walking around  but appearing not to notice things. This is stuff we noticed in the past. Also seems to be a high turnover rate of servers and managers. We probably won\'t be back for awhile  just isn\'t worth the aggrevation.",2.64,2.51,2.588,2.248,2.5620000000000003

We had a party of about 40 people which was big enough to make service slow. But that didn\'t happen!! Only thing that was ""slow"" was when we were actually getting our food. But come on! No one can bring out 40 plates at the same time. Lol. Our server was AL. He\'s the main reason I will come back to this establishment! Talk about a man with a sense of humor!! I love it when you go out to eat and your server can laugh and just have a good time. Not once did he give us an attitude about us asking for refills  to order more food  or bring out condiments (because let\'s face it  life would be too easy if we asked for everything at the same time.

Sat right next to the bar  still had to wait 20 minutes for a beer  while watching others around me get served. Waited almost an hour for dinner  just a burger & salad. It came out in 3 deliveries  forgot the fries  forgot the salad  the burger had been sitting a long time waiting to be brought out  so it was cold & obviously just slapped together. If the food was worth waiting for  that's one thing. But between being ignored & bad food & service  no more bj for me. There's plenty of other decent places to go.,2.96,2.58,2.608,1.7000000000000002,2.732

There was a waitress by the name of Jasmin. She must have been the rudest waitress  the way she talk to my friends. My friend asked to talk to the manager. The manager's name was James  he was very respectful and helpful. After we had an encounter with James. The service was much better. The waiter we got his name was Miguel. He was a very good waiter. James the manager made sure that the night would be pleasant for us.

Not to mention  it took an additional 30 minutes for the food to come to us and when it did it was undercooked. The rice in my meal was basically raw. The server never once came back to ask for refills and only refilled after we asked for it. Then when we ordered our dessert but then realized we wanted to change it she told us she had already put the order in and couldn't change. She then comes back another 10 minutes later asking what we wanted instead because she canceled the order. I don't understand why she didn't do that in the first place when we asked her in the first place 10 minutes ago instead of waiting so long to cancel it. Not to mention the entire time we were there  she had an attitude and even brought us the bill before asking if we wanted any dessert. I've been to this location multiple times and recent decent service but this was unacceptable.,2.92,2.56,2.62,1.7960000000000003,2.704
232,Caitlin T.,East Oakland  Oakland  CA,287,37,39.0,2016-02-13,1.0,"Wow. Terrible experience. Food tasted as if it were made out of a box - I mean completely unpalatable. Mashed potatoes were tragic. ""Italiano penne pasta"" was confused. Calamari was rubbery. Sent one dish back. I could\'ve made better food at home. Needless to say  I will NEVER come back to this location. They totally ruined it for me.",2.92,2.56,2.62,1.924,2.704
80,Jessica S.,San Francisco  CA,181,173,134.0,2016-02-15,4.0,I only really come here when I'm craving pizza. I always get the deep dish pizza to share with someone  and usually the calamari. I also always get the pizza half and half-yummy.I love both dishes. I've occasionally tried other dishes like the ribs which were tasty as well.The only downside here is the service. It's super slow  don't expect to see your waiter again after they drop off the food or to refill your drinks. You have to really flag someone down,3.04,2.59,2.632,2.256,2.7700000000000005
439,Jacob K.,Fresno  CA,1,4,,2016-02-16,1.0,Horrible service. Got seated and waitress forgot about us and got other people that had been seated after us their orders first.

628,Sheryel C.,San Mateo  CA,4,7,,2016-02-20,5.0,Probably the best experience I have ever had coming in here thanks to our wonderful server Fadi. The wait wasn't to bad for a friday night first off. After getting seated  literally the sweetest server ever  recommend soups to start our meal off  brought them out right away. Took our order  I had the fish tacos(asked if I wanted them grilled or fried!!) my brother had the chicken club sandwich. This is where it got a little iffy  we don't eat bacon  and the sandwich came out with bacon  BUT after pointing it out to Fadi  he took it right back to the kitchen and brought us out a new one without the bacon of course. After dinner we didn't have room for dessert but as an apology  Fadi brought us out a chocolate chip pazookie(my favorite). I would have to say  literally the best experience I have ever had here thanks to Fadi! Will defiantly request him to be my server next time I come in!,2.92,2.63,2.628,2.452,2.7459999999999996
204,Lisa H.,San Francisco  CA,169,60,63.0,2016-02-21,1.0,This place has the absolute worst service ever to be known in the world. What restaurant has 1200k+ reviews and still remain at 2 stars?!! Currently sitting here after waiting 15+ minutes to have our drink orders taken and when the waitress finally arrives  she was not even the slightest apologetic. It's understandable if she was busy but at least acknowledge our existence and let us know if you plan on coming to our table. This place is only good because of its hours and its prices for the amount of food. Don't bother coming here any other time of the day  it'd only ruin your day.,2.76,2.62,2.62,2.052,2.676
473,Alex L.,San Francisco  CA,482,105,12.0,2016-02-22,1.0,"BJ\'s typically is your average 3 star restaurant... on a good day. Came here with my dad for breakfast  what a mistake that was. It started from the point of ordering. I ordered the California scramble  and my dad ordered another breakfast entree. The kicker is when they asked him how he wanted his eggs done. He replied poached. First  off the waitress did not know what poached eggs were  then she said they didn\'t do that here and it is not on the menu. Fun fact  none of the style of eggs are on the menu  I didn\'t see  ""choose your style of eggs  sunnyside  scrambled  over easy."" Anyway  they ""accommodated"" us  which lead to the manager coming over saying how they had to ""accommodate"" us since poached eggs is not a typical option and for us to not expect it in the future. I had no idea that poached eggs were so difficult. Following the egg debacle  the service continued downhill where they didn\'t refill our drinks when we asked them to. Furthermore  we had asked for a pizza to be prepared to take away at the end of our meal  that was forgotten  extending our horrendous dining by another 20 minutes while they made it. The list goes on and on. They deserve negative 1 star for this experience and management needs to get a handle on their employees.",2.76,2.59,2.62,2.084,2.6579999999999995
143,Bryant C.,San Francisco  CA,207,129,81.0,2016-02-23,1.0,A sad shell of what this place used to be  they've kept their pizza and pizooki and streamlined everything else to be the next Cheesecake factory (or possibly Chili's). This place caters to the easy goers looking for a meal already decided for them and the business plan seems to be working out as there is always a wait. It's a comfortable environment to hang out and have a beer  but the restaurant has fallen to the wayside.FOOD:Avocado egg rolls were somehow served to us cold. Maybe they forgot to put it under the little heater as they waited to bring it to us (even though this was the appetizer). The whole thing was overly salted and the texture was as if it had been put into the fridge for a week then reheated. Then left out on the counter to recool. Then served. Stale. Terrible.The jambalaya was pretty flavorless. An incoherent mess of ingredients tried to be brought together in my usual favorite fashion: oil! Unfortunately  it somehow backfired and was terrible. Dirty greasy food is my favorite type of food and they still butchered it. An absolute travesty when compared to elephant bar's.Maybe I'm bitter that they got rid of my 3 favorite things (open faced chili cheese burger  nachos  and shrimp carbonara)  but the food they served me was objectively bad. This used to always be a safe bet  but when you drop the ball like this  my opinions change. I simply cannot support a place that serves me food like this.,2.68,2.59,2.616,2.212,2.6260000000000003
259,Bruce H.,LAKE VIEW TER  CA,0,88,217.0,2016-02-23,2.0,I eat a BJ's quite a bit when I'm on the road.  I dig there late night happy hour  and like the ambiance of sitting in a noisy sports bar when I'm away from home. This location was pretty bad. It took too long to get a waiter  then they never returned to see if I wanted another drink.  I get the Ahi Poke all the time. The one I got here for starters  looked like crap! In addition  the Ahi was cut too large and almost frozen. This place seems disorganized and possibly under staffed. Recently was working in South Sacramento and had been going to the BJ's in Elk Grove....awesome service  fast  good food.,2.72,2.6,2.62,2.3120000000000003,2.648

593,Dylan V.,San Francisco  CA,0,11,,2016-02-25,1.0,I would think that coming to this BJs would improve  but they always fail in service  food quality  and wait. I ordered food and it took 20 minutes longer than everybody else. And as soon as i got my food they didn't even have the whole meal ready. They had to give my fries later and that additionally took another 15 minutes when i was already almost done with my food. This BJs just sucks in general and id rather go to the food court then pay for this over priced shitty food. Additionally  out waiter Matt just sucks as a waiter. He didn't give any refills on water or soda through our whole stay  and didn't even to check how our shitty food was. If you get Matt prepare yourself for some shitty service.,2.52,2.57,2.6,2.244,2.55

421,D M.,San Jose  CA,29,8,1.0,2016-03-04,2.0,More of bar food rather than restaurant food. Calamari was not seasoned but sauces were provided on the side. They had very small crispy fries which might as well be called potato sticks/chips. Meat lover's pizza was extremely salty with an overwhelming flavor of ham. Service was okay but a long wait for the food when it is pretty packed.,2.32,2.56,2.6,2.3120000000000003,2.464
74,Joy W.,Woodland Hills  Woodland Hills  CA,183,440,2557.0,2016-03-05,3.0,BJ's is on par with all the other chain restaurants. So  I don't see why people would wait an hour for a table at BJ's  except maybe because it's one of the only sit-down restaurants with waiter service in the Tanforan mall.*To reduce the wait time  you can 1. Call ahead to be put on the waitlist. 2. Now  you can also download their mobile app and use the Preferred Waitlist function. 3. You can even place your order for dining in on their website.4. The bar area is open seating.*They try to cater to very different demographics. I get it  they're trying to capture as much market demand as the area has to offer. It's half a sports bar and half a family restaurant  which makes it rather confusing and not very optimal for either dining group. Sometimes you sit next to a tipsy frat boy  sometimes next to a screaming baby. Sometimes  you're within earshot of both. I'm just kidding...sort of.I've never been a fan because BJ's doesn't have many distinguishing signature dishes that sets it apart from other casual dining establishments. Wait  there are the Avocado Egg Rolls & Pizzookies...meh. Oh  and a decent beer selection.Avocado Egg Rolls - avocados  cream cheese  sun-dried tomatoes  red onions  cilantro  chipotle peppers & spices  with sweet tamarind sauce:Pretty good idea taking something good and fatty  wrapping it in spring roll wrappers and frying them. Crunchy & creamy  sweet and a just a little bit spicy. Not bad  but I can't stomach too many  because they're so oily and heavy. After a couple of these  they just feel like a lot of mush in my mouth. One too many and it would make me a little nauseous.As for the Pizzookie - the beloved pizza/cookie (cookie large enough to share) topped with ice cream. Frankly  I prefer cookies that are already individual-sized so I wouldn't need the use of a knife and fork. Yes it's good. Cookies and ice cream tasting good is like telling me the sky is blue. It's also a fine example of taking something that already exists and giving it a catchy name. Good marketing  but not exactly a novel idea.That's a little harsh. They do come in different flavors  after all.For more of a substantial meal  I usually get a burger. Burgers are always a fail-safe option in diners. The beef is usually cooked nearly well done  but they're meaty and filling  and that's all that matters.The pizzas are not bad. Although  the deep dish pizzas really shouldn't be called 'deep-dish.' It's more like thick doughy bread with some cheesy toppings.Ever since the FDA required chain restaurants to include nutritional info on their menus  I admit it somewhat influenced my decisions...briefly. I tried a salad  which I rarely do  because I usually prefer to make my own salad than pay a high mark-up for a dressed up pile of lettuce. But it turned out to be a pretty good salad.Santa Fe Salad - romaine  blackened chicken breast  red peppers  jack and cheddar  avocado  corn  diced tomatoes and corn tortilla strips w/ Santa Fe dressing:I chose the Santa Fe  because I like crunchy tortilla strips in my salads. They're like less-dense croutons with the same satisfying crunch. The dressing was creamy  but not heavy. Chicken was seasoned well. The ingredients tasted fresh and crisp.Chicken Wings drizzled w/ buffalo & ranch sauces are A-okay. We once received some raw chicken though. To be fair  it was only raw in the center. I understand mistakes happen  but they should have frying chicken down to a science. We told our waiter about the raw chicken and he was apologetic  super polite and friendly. They comped our chicken and brought out our second plate of cooked chicken. In my opinion  I kind of thought our meal should have been comped. Raw poultry is not to be taken lightly.Overall  the menu is  in a word  boring. That is to be expected  because it is still meant to cater to the masses. Still  I never find myself WANTING to visit BJ's. It's just an okay option if you're hungry after watching a movie. Mr. Joy likes this place for their happy hour deals  but after the raw chicken incident  I finally told him I have no interest in returning BJ's again. Raw food or not  there's really nothing at BJ's that I crave.On the plus side  I've always enjoyed the snakebites here. Also  I've always found the service to be pretty damn good. I don't know if my server was gunning for a big tip  but he brought me a refill of my drink before I even took a sip of my first one. Another time  I stupidly left my cell phone in one of the booths once. I came back all worried and harebrained  but my waiter kept it safe for me. What a great guy.,2.24,2.56,2.596,2.476,2.4320000000000004
351,Jillian C.,South San Francisco  CA,174,12,20.0,2016-03-05,1.0,Literally just left BJs because we were seated for over 20 minutes and no one acknowledged us. I even made eye contact with servers and the manager and nothing. The tables around us were being tended to except us. And just as we were getting ready to leave  the server from the table next to us comes over to wave n play with my baby then walked away. No asking of drink order  no asking if we've been helped or I'll be right back to get your order. Nothing. Thanks BJs.

The kitchen manager came out as well and they brought out an order that was made to perfection. It's amazing how better something tastes when made properly. It was night and day. If those boneless wings come out correctly each time  they will be my new favorite item. Like I'd said before  I hated leaving that review.

We got an appetizer and then we waited a little while for our meal  but we were both fine (I'm a waitress so I understand when things can take more time than others).

It was pretty busy so we grabbed a seat in the bar. Our server came over and because it was raining we chose not to risk drinking. We ordered waters and we got an eye roll. It may have been imagines so I ignored it We ordered dinner and my mothers meal was incorrect. She ordered tacos and got a sandwich. The runner said he'd look into it. Our server came by a few minutes later and said she misheard but then said she only ordered to what my mother was pointing to. She never pointed to anything  her hand was resting on the menu She said the order would be expedited and it would be 5 minutes tops 15 or 20 minutes later as my food sat iced cold she said that shrimp took a long time which is why it couldn't be expedited. It was sauted shrimp 3 minutes on each side. The entire meal and evening was ruined by someone who couldn't do their job,2.12,2.58,2.604,2.216,2.396
282,Gabe M.,Bloomington  MN,0,5,,2016-03-15,5.0,"Me and my family ate at this restaurant yesterday before leaving to fly home from the San Francisco bay area. What first drew us to BJ\'s was the attractive building. We were not even planning on going to BJ\'s (we were on our way to Red Robin) and I saw the attractive brick building with great landscaping and a cool  shiny beer vat outside. I said  ""Ooohh! Look! That place looks good!"" So we made a split second change and tried BJ\'s.And it was a great choice!Food was hot  tasty  and came out in a timely manner. Our server  Matt was AWESOME!! I haven\'t had many servers as genuine and as caring as Matt was. His hospitality sure as heck was not forced  but very  very genuine and real. He was at our table every few minutes checking in on us  asking if we needed refills  or if he could get anything else for us. He even had around 4-5 other tables while having us  a table of 6. But he treated us like we were his only table! He even gave us a free giant cookie to share before leaving California. He set an EXCELLENT first impression of BJ\'s for us!

372,Merly I.,San Francisco  CA,8,133,14.0,2016-03-16,2.0,Typical sports restaurant/bar chain.. Would suggest going for the Happy hour deals -check on their website for times!. Today  I was passing through San Bruno and decided I wanted to watch sports  so I decided to stop in BJ'S . My waiter at the bar area was swamped with tables and I had to flag him down just to refill my water!. :(I ordered the Ahi-Salad!. Surprisingly  the salad was enough for one person!. the Ahi slices were fresh (could had been more) ;( but it was full of flavor and texture for my enjoyment.So  during all that time from me flagging down waiter to refilling my water ...he never came back to see how I was doing? Or if I needed anything else?!. I am One paying consumer if I get Great Service I tip very well!! :D in this case  sad to say..I tipped waiter way under (sorry to do that) due to his lack of attention to my table..I was ready to hand him a $10.00 bill..that changed to $3.00 :(,2.36,2.61,2.624,2.248,2.51
369,Chris S.,San Francisco  CA,123,121,76.0,2016-03-18,2.0,The service here sucks. It took several minutes for a server to come with menus. We ordered two drinks and buffalo wings. The wings took over an hour to come to our table. I've always come here  but it seems like the service just goes down the drain each time. I'm taking my money across the street to Jack's!,2.4,2.62,2.628,2.216,2.532
136,Lauren C.,Alhambra  CA,304,27,40.0,2016-03-22,2.0,This seems to be the go to place whenever we have large parties to feed. The portions are big and there's a wide selection for food. We almost always have left overs which is great for a midnight snack. I especially love getting their burgers with fries. My favorite is the guacamole burger. It's so filling and their fries are always so crispy and golden. For appetizers  I love their avocado eggrolls and lettuce wraps. I'm hooked on those two dishes.Lastly  let's not forget about the pazookie! If you've never had one before  it's basically a freshly baked cookie topped off with icecream. I feel like it's a tradition to get a pazookie with every visit. If you're with a couple friens  I'd recommend the Pizookie Trio because then you get to three different pazookies instead of one. Whenever I'm here  the service is great. I've had some bad experiences in other restaurants where waiters were inattentive and didn't want to deal with such a large group but not at BJ's. Our waiters were always coming in to check up on us and refill our water. I realize it's hard dealing with more than 20 people so I appreciate that they were extremely nice and organized with our party. The reason for my low review isn't the food but the cleanliness of the utensils and tables. I wish I had more pictures from past experiences but a majority of the times that I have come  I have had to flag down a waiter because there's stains on our utensils or lipstick on the cups. It's made me extremely paranoid every time I come here. The last time I came  I was about to dip my spoon into my soup when I realized there was some weird red gunk on it. Then I realized it was on some of my other utensils too. I think I'm just unlucky every time I come here  but also I really do hope that the staff double check their utensils before they give them out to customers.,2.44,2.6,2.632,2.248,2.536

I have operated businesses for over 20 years and can\'t think of a chain restaurant in more diss array. The management obviously doesn\'t care about their customers or the business. Here\'s what\'s wrong with BJ\'s: 1. Food is below average at best!...always undercooked  overlooked  missing standard ingredients/accompaniments  2. Slowest kitchen in the area  hands down  3. Your order will almost always be a mistake  4. The manager will be non existent & often playing with his/her staff in the BOH or FOH  with no regard for their actual job  5. Your waiter/waitress will be brand new with little to no experience and often leave for lengths of time with out checking on you  6. YOU WILL WAIT (on avg.) ""1 hour"" MIN TO RECEIVE YOUR FOOD  7. You will ask to talk to the manager about your food delay and he will cower in the BOH & never come out to address the problem.  8. You will make a reservation only to find out that once you arrive  you will wait another 20-30 minutes while they lie and say ""we\'re clearing your table now"" (that means they never took your reservation).Bottom line....been here probably 12x  with varying size parties  always a problem  managers are a joke  wait staff untrained at best  food is substandard  food is always a hellacious wait  restaurant is dirty  and overcrowded. I feel like applying to run this restaurant as it has so much promise but so much of it is broken! Does the Regional Manager even know what\'s happening with this restaurant? Does the corporation even care? Whomever is the CEO of BJ\'s should be ashamed of this location! It\'s down right awful. I would never recommend this restaurant to even an enemy!!!!",2.68,2.64,2.636,1.956,2.656
398,Bella J.,San Francisco  CA,1,5,3.0,2016-04-10,1.0,Came here for lunch today with my family and it turn out the service and food quality went down hill. We ordered the bbq chicken salad  bj pizza  shrimp panne pasta and 2 kids meal and some drinks. We waited almost an hour and all the entree came and the pizza was not hot and the bbq chicken salad was still not ready so we end up canceling the salad. After eating I started having a up sad stomach!!! Probably will not come back again!,2.68,2.62,2.636,1.956,2.644
164,Chrys S.,Burlingame  CA,250,333,681.0,2016-04-13,3.0,Good lunch specials but it is loud. Great stop if you want to catch a game on TV. Lots of TVs from every seating vantage point. It does get very busy at lunch. Ample parking since it is at Tanforan mall. But you can also get here via BART. The San Bruno station is just a hop and a skip away.The food is average American fare but they make their own root beer and have a vast array of beers on tap.It is a good option if you just need a standard meal and want to catch a game on TV.,2.76,2.61,2.628,2.1559999999999997,2.67

The deep dish pizza is underrated but could use a little more sauce. I tried the hoagie sandwich. Not bad but I don't think I'd get it again. I don't like Dijon mustard  so make sure you tell them to switch out to normal French's mustard if that's your preference. Service was really good here.,2.8,2.62,2.632,2.38,2.692

No where to be found. well I mean that not my problem but we were scheduled to watch a movie after BUT now we missed it because of the lack of our server... honestly  it's not only the servers but it wasn't a full full house so managers be on top of your toes and keep watch of your staff. because customers like me would complain  I just didn't have the time to.,2.76,2.61,2.636,2.3440000000000003,2.67

Our service was almost non existent from the start. We only saw our original server in the beginning and assumed she went on break or something when a new server (who looked under the influence) came back after we were done and gave us the check and took the card for payment. .  The transaction took longer than normal which I thought everyone here was just slow due to the service we received  but within the next week I received fraudulent charges on the card I used there. It was a card infrequently used and the only place where the card was out of my sight. I didn't want to post if I was wrong  but just recently a friend had a mentioned how his card got fraud charges after paying at BJs this location with a card. This was too much to be coincidence so watch your cards and be careful when it's out of you sight!,2.72,2.59,2.628,2.2760000000000002,2.6420000000000003

371,Jaymee F.,South San Francisco  CA,0,6,4.0,2016-05-01,1.0,Today is the first time my husband got so pissed of with a server/host that he decided to leave and eat somewhere else. It was me  my husband and our 11 mos baby thats sitting in his stroller. We come in at 11am the place is not yet full and there's 4 of them at the door. My husband said table for 3 with a baby  the guy didnt say nothing then looked at the girl beside him  disnt even bother to greet us or just say ok or anything!! Then ny husband told him that maybe we could just leave the stroller somewhere so he can sit us already cos he heard them talking about our big stroller. Then he AGAIN did not bother to say anything. Then they sit us in a round table without a highchair  do you want us to carry the baby while we eat? I dont know whats wrong with these people. It seems like they're not even thinking at all! Worst restaurant ever!!,2.4,2.57,2.612,2.436,2.502
255,Gracie M.,San Francisco  CA,28,2,1.0,2016-05-04,5.0,5 STARS is definitely well deserved for the server we had tonight. :) My little family has been a loyal customer since our son was a baby (and he's 6 now!). It's our favorite BJ's location and we have a lot of memories at this place like multiple birthday dinners  staff lunches  and family Sunday brunches. We often are lucky to always receive good service here  but tonight was GREAT SERVICE. Our server NICK H. was the best! It's our first time having him and let me tell you... he was just so genuinely nice  quick  and my family just enjoyed our time after a long  busy day. I'm a working mom from 7am-6pm so I'm always on the go and family dinners are so important to my family and me.... So when we get service like tonight  I'm not going to miss a chance to blog it (and I RARELY post)! Also  the new manager Tom was so pleasant to talk to. He has really good vibes and he even set my staff's dinner coming up with no hassle. Again  I love this place... My hubby loves it (especially the root beer!)  and if my son loves it.. It's a done deal  we are coming here always. Lol This place deserves more stars. Good food  good bar  great service  and fun location. Ask for Nick H..... AWESOME SERVICE for sure.,2.52,2.61,2.624,2.9320000000000004,2.574
216,Merie M.,Marina  CA,23,9,1.0,2016-05-08,1.0,Kinda of disappointed. Chicken lettuce wrap... Not what I had expected. I've been to several BJs and I'm sure that they use ground chicken. The food wasn't satisfying. Not worth it here... I also ordered the calamari  the sauce was all over the plate. What waste of my money. They can do better- common guys- get it together like the other BJs,2.48,2.57,2.624,2.436,2.534
72,Robert F.,San Francisco  CA,87,655,4187.0,2016-05-08,3.0,Came here about 2 weeks ago and it was an interesting experience for sure!When I arrived I was informed that the bar was open and that the floor seating was full. That was fine so my party and I decided to walk around and wait for a table to open up. After shopping around at the near by Barnes and Nobles the timer went off and the table was ready. Upon returning to the restaurant my group and I were seated and handed menus. The menu is just as advertised. Lots of choices to choose from if you have a big appetite. If you like beer this place is for YOU! There are several TVs here which is great because the NBA playoffs were on and that was a primary reason for stopping by to eat lunch. I wanted to at least watch till halftime before leaving but we left midway through the 2 quarter. My issue with this place stemmed from the server. He was just not attentive or interested in serving anyone. The way in which he placed the plates on the table to serve us was nonchalantly. I mean  if you don't care about getting a tip or tipped well I get it. Or  maybe you just didn't feel like coming in today. I was not sure what the issue was but it was not necessary. I will come back and give the bar a try next time. I have heard good reviews about the drinks and the bartenders. Also  the beer selection here is worthy trying as well.,2.52,2.56,2.62,2.604,2.544
215,Bing W.,Daly City  CA,94,32,8.0,2016-05-09,1.0,Things have really gone downhill at BJ's and its no surprise to see so many bad reviews. Just went there today for lunch and stood in front of the hostess counter to get a table for 5 minutes without even being acknowledged. There were two hostesses there just chatting it up and didn't even care that customers were waiting on them. It's like BJs management just hires people for the hell of it and aren't supervised so these people are getting paid to socialize. Lucky them. After being ignored  I just found a seat at the bar instead. Service was slow as usual  tables sticky/unclean  and the menu is now a disaster. It seems as if BJs is trying to mimic cheesecake factory's menu but failed miserably. Ordered the new baked ziti dish and the bottom of the dish is literally all oil. I understand maybe some oil due to the cooking process  but the pasta was floating in oil. To say that least  I highly doubt I'll be going back. There are other places in the area that are at least cleaner and hostess more professional.,2.36,2.56,2.612,2.5000000000000004,2.48

We said we were no longer interested in the wings (for pretty obvious reasons  I\'d say) to which she lectured us that they are not ""wings "" but in fact ""nuggets"" and refused to take them from our table.

Get to the restaurant at 7:08 and then I\'m told it\'s another half hour wait but I\'ll ""be at the top of the list"". Fast forward to 7:55 when I have to get up and ask them how much longer because they\'ve called 6 parties of 2  a party of 7  and a party of 3.

Additionally  our server forgot our orders  we were told the kitchen was backed up and the manager came out to apologize. The apology would've been nice but he didn't even offer to comp the drinks or the app we ordered (so kinduv an empty apologize). In total we spent $60 for a pretty shitty experience.,2.32,2.56,2.6,2.6280000000000006,2.464
334,J G.,Burlingame  CA,59,26,10.0,2016-05-15,1.0,Terrible experience tonight  and we've been to BJ'S many time. For starters we had 7 in our party  appetizers came pretty quick and we're good. Drinks also came  we'll 6 did the 7th took about 15 minutes. Meals came 5 and of 7 INCORRECT  Asked for no mayo  my burger came fully loaded with mayo. My mother asked for extra mayo and wedge fries  hers came with no mayo and skinny fries. Both of those are manageable  so we ate with no complaints. My 2 young daughters had kids meals  one with chicken strips and apple sauce  of course they bring it with fries and no applesauce so my toddler had a meltdown. They finally bring her applesauce but NO SPOON  we asked 3 different people for spoons  another 15 minutes with NO spoon. Another meltdown.My other daughter ordered the kids cheeseburgers  they come and NO LIE  the burgers were about the size of a half dollar (one bite) and the bun was trippen the sz  we all laughed about it but the server or manager did nothing about it. Last but not least was my teenager ordered a turkey club with no sauce  garlic  mayo or ranch. She hates sauces/condiments of course it comes with all the white gooey garlic/mayo sauce dripping from it  she wanted to puke. We told the server which of course they had to make another one. By the time it came  15 minutes later  everyone was done and wanted to get the hell outta there she took a few bites but was no longer hungry. You would think they would compensate something but nope nothing  our server didnt even care about all the screwups..we spent over $125 for Shitty service  and mediocre food. Not to mention 2 got diarrhea and I have vomited twice since coming home. It's going to be awhile before we go back to any BJ's.,2.32,2.54,2.6,2.6280000000000006,2.452
335,Chris S.,San Francisco  CA,6,96,33.0,2016-05-15,1.0,I've consistently had really bad beer that lacked carbonation and any depth of flavor. I'm not just talking about their own brew but also any other beer on tap like new castle or boddington. Also this isn't the first time that I felt this way since the last time I came it was the same experience. It even happened to me when I came here for a work lunch and ordered a soda. Even that was flat and desperately needed carbonation. Lastly the service is always horrible at the bar where the bar tender don't acknowledge you. I'll never return!,2.24,2.53,2.588,2.724,2.414
253,Nancy M.,San Francisco  CA,1,4,,2016-05-16,3.0,Me and my best friend come here a lot to join ourselves. Everytime we come we have a great experience  but i don't know what happen today.We knew it was going to be busy (Warrior Playoff Game) so we called to put our name ahead like we always do. Nobody picked up the phone. So we did what the option told us (put our name on the app) It's was going to be a 45min wait. That's normal for a game night. We got to the host to check in. And we were told that the app doesn't work with the computer system. Why have it as a option if it doesn't work. The host (Blond Hair) told us that it was going to take 10-15 min. We were okay with that. We wait almost 35 min. We keep looking at her. She could have least apologize for waiting longer then usually. Finally we were seat. We already knew what we wanted to drink and eat. The section we were seated look like everyone was just chilling watching the game. We were like cool the serve will get to us faster. NOPE!! We waited 20 more minutes. We had to ask a Busser if he could get our waiter. We saw him go to our server and told him that we were waiting. He comes to his section but completely ignores us. He goes to check on his other tables and doesn't make eye contact or tells us anything. He finally comes to us by that time we were just over it. We order our drinks and all our food right away. We waiting another 15 min to get our drinks. The server only realize that we didn't have our drink when we looked bored. He comes and drops the drinks. Again no apologize for anything.I only going to give 3 stars because the drinks were super super BOOM! And the food was delicious. The manager on duty at the time did come  but me and my friend were just over the whole thing that it wasn't worth our time to explain everything. I'm sorry. Now I have 2 servers that I don't want them to wait on me or my friend. Still coming but if I get him or the other server I would be asking to either switch sections or server.,2.32,2.52,2.584,2.9240000000000004,2.44

But right as game time comes the TV we are closest to changes to a hockey game... WTH?!!! Asked our waiter to change it  he had to ask the manager. Thankfully she came over and we mentioned how long we've been waiting to see the game. Not to mention 90% of the customers had Warriors gear on.... Had it changed back to Warriors. All is well in the world! Thank you  much appreciated!,2.32,2.52,2.6,3.0920000000000005,2.44

Always warm with a dollop of ice cream  they heavens answer to what a cookie pie should be. And if you\'re not in the mood for a large one  there are mini versions  too. Aside from that  I love their burgers and shoe string fries. This last visit  our waiter was very quick and helpful. Despite being very overwhelmed in his section with over twenty tables to serve  he made us feel heard. My hub and I never had to ask for a refill for our drinks and he knew when the check was needed. The food alterations were also followed through. We were very thankful and ate a delicious meal.",2.52,2.54,2.624,2.768,2.532

500,Erika C.,Sunnyvale  CA,133,30,3.0,2016-05-25,2.0,So lets start out by saying we informed the waiter we were on a time restraint. Our waiter was this young guy by the name of Michael B. So I wanted to get relaxed as I was catching a redeye flight to Miami. First off there were three of us that had ordered alcoholic drinks. Michael felt the need to have me go back out to the car to get my I.D ;however he didn't card my sister or my other buddy. Michael literally didn't put my drink until I returned with my I.D. Okay  maybe he really thought I wasn't 21!!! Hmmmmmm So we put our order in 20 minutes had passed and the waiter had yet to give us utensils or go and check on our order. The manager was soooooo compensating for this young punk's arrogance ass attitude. My sister had waved to get our waiter's attention and he sent another staff to help us out. As a matter of fact all the other staff was very helpful accept our own waiter. So now I'm growing impatient and I ask the waiter if he could see how long b4 our food was ready. He stated that he hadnt had a chance to check on the food. MICHAEL B had checked on every customer 2-3 more than he had on us. The manager again stepped in and apologized and had comped some items due to dumb dumbs lack of customer service. I had asked the manager if she could get our bill because we needed to leave. The manager complied and got the bill for us. As we sat there our waiter again  continues to ignore us as if we weren't sitting there..I go up front to pay the bill and the young lady tells me only my waiter can close out my bill. The staff goes to relay the message as she sees that I'm frustrated and growing impatient. Michael B comes to close out the bill and literally starts walking slow  talking to his co-workers and just taking his sweet time to swipe my card. I had to just be silent; otherwise I would've grabbed him by that punkass ponytail and went Bam Bam on him!!!! I am very gracious and good about compensating and giving waiters tips but this imbecile deserved absolutely nothing but a punch in tha face!!! If I should ever go back to that BJ's I will refuse service if he has to wait on me. It is very sad to have an asshole like that while all the others are working diligently to satisfy the customers! His parents must own the establishment because I do NOT understand why he is still employed there!! MICHAEL B  YOU are exactly the first letter or your last name!!! I'm so glad that I have grown to become a bigger and better person and for that I Cant not DEAL WITH YOU!!!!,2.8,2.61,2.62,2.44,2.686
102,Rosalyn L.,Elk Grove  CA,117,130,1754.0,2016-05-26,2.0,"I\'ve been occasionally going to this BJs whenever I\'m in the area. Most of the time the food and service is decent and it\'s a great place to catch up with friends  who like me  are indecisive when it comes to picking a place to eat. They have a wide variety of options including pastas  pizzas  burgers  steaks  and they even have healthier (low calorie) options for anyone who feels like eating light.My last experience here started off really well. My family and I started off with the avocado egg rolls and clam chowder in a bread bowl. The avocado egg rolls are always a must for me because I love avocados and these are just deep fried rolls of creamy and cheesy goodness. The clam chowder was also really good. The bread bowl was crisp and light  with the perfect chewy texture. After our appetizers  it didn\'t take long before our main entrees came to the table. What prompted this review and a two star rating was that our dessert took well over 50 mins to get to the table. Every 15 minutes or so  our server came to our table  apologizing for the long wait and stated that our pizookie would be out shortly. I didn\'t mind at first because I was enjoying my company and conversation. After the third apology I was gonna call quits on the dessert but thought ""what the heck  I\'ve waited this long what\'s another couple of minutes?"" BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! Finally  we were told that they would give us another pizookie on the house because of the wait. To my utmost disappointment  not only did we not get the second pizookie  our original one came wrapped up in foil packed as a takeout!",2.72,2.62,2.624,2.472,2.66

234,Ashley F.,San Jose  CA,0,11,,2016-05-28,4.0,Here waiting .... I understand it's busy but lack of communication is the issue.. The waiter walks by 15 times looks at us and keeps walking ordered the drinks 30 mins later they come and 2 is missing 15 mins later they come and we order apps I had to ask the guy 30 mins after to please take our order. We have no silver ware menus are sticky! And are waiter just says he is busy! I mean I worked at a restraunt and this is just insane. Drinks are empty and still waiting for food. Such awful service ! Update!!!!! The Gm tom got my alert and came over to apologize to me and my party. The fact that he took the time to completely apologize and help out with our order. They were busy and I understand that. Thank you so much the fact that you recognized the issue and took time out of your duties to help us with our order was completely nice of you.

314,Denise I.,San Francisco  CA,26,38,19.0,2016-05-29,2.0,Ended up here yesterday b/c my out-of-town  ex-inlaws chose it. Service was slow and inattentive. Took at least 45 minutes to receive our food  they forgot the fries  never refilled the empty water glasses. Food was solidly mediocre  but wasn't expecting much to begin with  so on that front it didn't disappoint.,2.92,2.65,2.636,2.3440000000000003,2.758
56,Kirstie P.,Daly City  CA,426,92,1236.0,2016-05-30,3.0,#75 I used to come here a lot before they decided to break my heart and take the BJ's brownie off of their menu. Unlike most people  Im not really into pizookies. I just think its way too sweet for me. Alcoholic beverages aren't strong enough. I usually ask them to remake it. Service is always slow whether or not you're in a big party. The only reason why I still come here is because their food is consistent. For the past 5+ years  I've always ordered the same thing: Parmesan crusted chicken  avocado egg rolls  and their brownie before they stopped making it. Prices and menus have changed over the years but these dishes remain constant. Recently I decided to finally try something new  so I ordered their deep dish ravioli. It tasted like a gourmet Hot Pocket but expensive. Not worth it. I like the concept of their rewards program but last I checked  you couldn't give them your phone number and you had to bring your rewards card with you every time. That makes it difficult to accumulate points.,2.92,2.64,2.628,2.54,2.7520000000000002

183,Elle C.,Milpitas  CA,37,37,8.0,2016-05-31,1.0,"My daughter had a show nearby last December and we wanted to celebrate with our family that drove out to see her. BJ\'s closes late and can fit a large amount of people so we decided to come here. Biggest mistake! By their wait staff\'s behavior they obviously dislike each other and hate their jobs.We arrived at 9pm and got seated closer to 11pm. They kept saying 20 minutes  20 minutes. If they just told the truth we could have gone somewhere else. A few of my family members that drove 1 1/2 hours had to leave before we were seated because it was getting so late. We finally get seated and placed our drink order and waited 15 minutes for that. When our waitress came to take our food order another waitress came by and said she was slow and she can help but our waitress was salty and told her to bounce. We waited another 45 minutes before our food finally came out. She rarely came to our table to check on us but she was very attentive to a table across from us. While we waited for our drinks to be refilled a male waiter was passing by and my son said ""excuse me"" to get someone\'s attention. That male waiter kept walking and said ""I don\'t work here"" but entered the kitchen. Ew.We finally got the attention of another male waiter who started checking on us because our chic wasn\'t. He got our dessert order but got it wrong and we waited another 30 minutes for that and then another 30 minutes for our bill. We were frustrated with waiting and for being ignored we were complaining to each other about the horrible service. The male waiter that supposedly didn\'t work there and another one were sitting at a booth nearby giving us nasty looks for complaining. By the time we left it was almost 1am.Never ever again. My daughter has another show coming up in July and this time we won\'t be coming here nor would I recommend it to any of the 100+ performers and our 900 guests.",2.88,2.7,2.64,2.244,2.7720000000000002

Minus one star for giving me stone cold fries. Seriously they felt like it was cooked and dumped in the fridge for 5 minutes. That's how cold the fries were. However  the server was quick to correct the problem. I got fresh hot fries as soon as I flagged him down about the problem. I did like my portobello mushroom burger. That was super yummy.,3.0,2.7,2.652,2.576,2.8200000000000003

96,Merrick W.,Pacifica  CA,16,164,5.0,2016-06-03,3.0,I understand the lack of enthusiasm for this place -- it's because of the lack of enthusiasm from its kitchen. The hostess was great very friendly and helpful and got me a great table. Took a bit for my server to ask for drink order  but that's ok  she made it up in friendliness and great service  and was pretty prompt in getting my order.Ordered soup and entree salad -- only problem was that salad came out first -- pretty quick  which I appreciate  but the cup of soup should have been first and I had to WAIT on that.  To me  kitchen's fault more than server's. When I finally got the soup  it was lukewarm.  I told server not to remake  just nuke. Got the soup and it was good.Then tackled the Asian Chopped Salad  which had been sitting on the table all this time and although great ingredients  it was pretty uninspired. It just had no kick to it like other salads of this kind  and the chicken was just OK  like it had been sitting around all day and was thrown in the salad  not fresh. And that's the thing -- the whole salad was missing freshness.I really think you guys (BJs mgmt) need to take another look at how things are prepared in the kitchen  how incoming orders are processed  etc. I don't see the problem as much being the servers and everyone in front of house  who are all working their butts off  as much as those in the kitchen and back of house -- maybe they don't have enough support?Excellent menu  so BJs does got it going there  but the operation of it all really needs a looking at and an overhaul.,3.08,2.7,2.66,2.38,2.8520000000000003
486,Dean N.,San Francisco  CA,39,108,95.0,2016-06-05,2.0,"Walking in I was struck by the lack of character. I was not expecting much  however I had a recommendation and their previous recommendation was not horrible. Then I got my hopes up remembering a great microbrewery in Boston and a couple in NYC. I didn\'t have any beer there  so maybe if I had then my experience would have been different. However their home-brewed soft drinks were undrinkable. I would list those drinks on my ""the worst thing I ever ate"" list  so even if I tried their beer I doubt any changes. appetizer was potato skins  which I almost stopped ordering because they are horrible so many places  these came out looking good  but no sour cream and fake bacon. Glad I was hungry. For entree I had a steak  potato and asparagus. Steak was cooked almost correctly  at least rare and two bites were amazing. If they had talent or skill amazing things could have happened in their kitchen. Baked potato was blah. Asparagus tasted liked they scraped their shrimp sauce off before serving  even served cold. Finally  for a tie breaker I had dessert  and since national donut day was last week I decides to try their beignet. I mean... how can they mess those up. Well they far exceeded their incompetence. The gelato was one of my favorite brands  but hidden under their canned whipped cream and strawberries that were sour  and had a weird oily covering I guess to supply the flavor that was lacking. Two stars for the attempt to cook a steak. At least they achieved a correct internal temperature and two flavorful bites.",3.04,2.68,2.668,2.088,2.8240000000000003

But usually I get sat down right away. We came during a sharks game .. good thing we came right at the right time because It was getting busy right after we arrived. Food came later than expected but we weren't in a rush and understood it was a full house and crazy game going on. Food was good as always. Are server was nice and even tho it was busy  she kept checking In on us and making sure our drinks we're refilled. BTW before you leave  I suggest you try a pazookie.. at least once in your life.

Horrible service  45 min. to just get my dish  Mahi and shrimp  but my husband\'s ahi salad  had not arrived yet. How long can it take to make a cold Ahi dinner? The Mahi was Luke warm when it arrived  inedible . The garlic knot was hard as a rock. Called the manager. She said she would get me something else... Let me remind you the ahi salad... Still not arrived. So I ordered the kale brussel sprout salad  which she said would be ""super speedy"". 15 min later both showed up. Unfortunately you could not eat the brussel sprouts because they were not cooked fully. I guess that would have taken another 15 min. No wait  it\'s a cold salad and they should have been ready ! Good news is the ahi salad was edible . They also charged us for everything which if they were smart they might have at least in good faith have given me the salad.

160,Lauren W.,South San Francisco  CA,14,29,17.0,2016-06-07,1.0,"I swear  EVERYTIME I come here it\'s a problem. Last time  I was told a 20 minute wait.. I come in 25 mins later.. My food isn\'t even started being cooked. Because whoever took my order didn\'t think to mention the Santa Fe rolls are on recall  so they just changed my order to wings.. I walk up to pay and the lady says so what kinda wings you want? Confusing when I never ordered wings & a bit rude to not explain why your asking me about wings. I ask for s manager  he was very understanding and seemed to actually care about the customers feedback which was nice. I came back honestly because he was so genuine & seemed really concerned w/the well being of the staff & store  but god forbid BJs take care of my order properly. I come in tonight  my food was just sitting on the counter  not in the oven.. For 10 minutes while I waited to even be helped & another 8 for the girl to ""find"" the rest of my order. I asked the lady how long my food had been sitting out & she had hella attitude like ""Uhm only 5 minutes since I just walked up here 2 seconds ago.."" Meanwhile I was already waiting 15 minutes & saw my food sitting on the counter the entire time (just didn\'t know it was mine) I get home  they made me the wrong salad  my potato wedges were fried to a crisp with hardly any of the toppings  just Dry potato skin which is disgusting  they didn\'t give me the side of sour cream either. Plus when I called  I specifically asked them to make sure they were cooked properly b/c if I don\'t mention it there burned & dry. The SAME girl who had the attitude at the To go table is the girl who took my order & when I asked them to make sure it was cooked w/all the toppings she\'s like ""Obviously it will be on there if that\'s what comes with it or I can charge you for extra"" like obviously I wouldn\'t be asking for it to be cooked properly if there was no chance it would be cooked wrong. My boyfriend ordered an appetizer plate of chicken tenders yet they gave us a lunch order with fries which isn\'t what he asked for. The fries that came with it were so chewy & gross. Probably from sitting out for so long On top of all that horrible food  I figured there\'s no way they messed up my pizookie.. So I just threw my order in the trash & BOOM! My pizookie & my boyfriends pizookie were burnt. Hard as a rock. Even the ice cream wouldn\'t soften it up. Such a waste of $60 .. I would come back & tell the manager  but every time I come here it\'s like I have to talk to a manager or I won\'t get treated properly. If I\'m a paying customer I should just be treated kindly & have the proper food cooked. Of course slip ups happen. But it is EVERY TIME w/this location.Come to BJs throw your money away on burnt food & help yourself to some crap service & nasty attitude from the Take out girl  Verryy disappointing !!",3.16,2.68,2.68,2.02,2.8720000000000003

I understand there was a Warriors game on and the restaurant was more busy on a weeknight than it would have been had it not been for the game. But really?A friend and I came by to have dinner before watching a movie. We received our menus and were thus forgotten about.We waited for thirty minutes  we asked for help to a couple of servers passing by and they said they'd grab our waiter for us. Never happened since no one came to us.Mind you  WE DID NOT EVEN GET WATER.And when we decided to leave  we went to the front and told a server who was STANDING with the hosts doing nothing  that we were leaving because no one served us. Is it because it was just a table for two? They decided to overlook and ignore us for the bigger tables where they'd get more business and thus bigger tips?Unacceptable.,3.28,2.67,2.692,1.924,2.9139999999999997

This is hands down the most unusual and worst BJs location I've been to. The service is slow and the waitstaff seems to care less. There was a new guy training tonight (with potential to be great)  but service tonight was on par with the reviews...bad. The kitchen needs work also. It took over twenty minutes for my two appetizers to be served. The guacamole was good  but it was served with stale chips. Chicken lettuce wraps tasted good  but chicken was served in big chunks...it's usually cut up into small centimeter cubes to make it easier to eat with the lettuce leaves.

After that  he turn to other table to take order. Time passed like 10 min or less. The order infront of us arrived and our server went to the restroom. Time passed by like 12 to 15min and i asked help from a busser/server to assist following up with the food. And the busser said yes. But he went instead to the bar and took the drinks to serve in other tables. One woman server I asked help again. She mentioned table 802 when i pointed where we were seated. And our server I saw coming out from the restroom. I asked him for follow up on the food because my 19 month old baby is hungry. And he said he is also waiting fot the food and turn his back right away. HE SAID THAT WITHOUT EVEN GOING TO THE KITCHEN AREA AND CHECKING OUT. HE SAID THAT THEN and went to THE TABLE infront of us to TAKE ORDER!!. Pissed us off right away. We walked out and talked to the mgr on duty and the mgr is offering us food and I said no more.

Normally drinks  appetizers and food take way longer than expected but Jimmy made it happen tonight. He was attentive and on it with the service. He was on top of every table he had tonight that was around us. Super friendly and personable. The only way we are coming back to this BJ'S is if Jimmy is our server again!,2.84,2.61,2.664,2.42,2.702

And then the fairytale ended  my family and I celebrated Mother\'s Day at Bjs. Obviously I ordered the ahi poke  when it came out it was light pink almost brown  there was less fish  and it was cut horribly! It looked like the chef just threw it on my plate! I asked my server why it looked like that and asked for a new one. He said it was because they had a new ""salad guy"". I got my new one  it looked the same  whatever I ate it. A couple weeks later  I came back and ordered the same thing. It looked like the same thing  but this time  they put less fish! Wtf. I sent it back and ordered something else.

193,Kimberly S.,San Francisco  CA,2,49,,2016-06-17,4.0,I love BJ's Resturant over in Tanforan Mall. It's a convenient place to grab a bite before seeing a movie or just wandering around the shops walking off some of the calories! We've had lots of waiters over the years but Mark G  Shay and Briana are just my absolute favs! They always greet us with a smile and never rush us or our order. We always feel like we're around friends when we go here. Just wanted to give a shout out so Management knows they've got some great people working the floor! We are lucky enough to have time off during the week so we can go when it's not super swamped and have a minute or two between appetizers and the main course to have some friendly convos with them when the restaurant isn't busy and they stop by the table to see if we need anything.The food at BJ's seems to change every now and then  but you can always find something tasty on the menu. The beers are obviously a focal point and I like the darker end of the taps  but that's neither here nor there. (The new derby cobb salad is pretty darn good and not pre-tossed like the last one  so there's a plus!!!) I wish they had growlers to go  but .... they don't. I guess it's because they don't brew on site - except for their sodas  I think.Unless they do something awful with the service or food  I'll always choose it first over Hooters or the food court on the other side of the mall!Do yourself a favor and sign up for the rewards program  take advantage of their smartphone app and try grabbing a pizza to go - every aspect of their service is great.,2.92,2.59,2.648,2.256,2.7219999999999995
185,Debbie S.,San Bruno  CA,143,54,11.0,2016-06-18,1.0,I would give this place a BIG FAT ZERO if the option was available. YOU MUST READ MY REVIEW FOR YOUR SAFETY! Considering I live in San Bruno  I've only come here three times and the last time I was here was three times too many. When they first opened  I ordered a salad and wanted steak on it (steak salad). Well I was charged for a large salad plus charged for a steak dinner. Their reasoning was that a steak salad was not on their menu. Well now it is. Maybe my complaint made it to the top. Second time  it took 15 mins to get attended to by a server and 35 min wait for our food. The last time I was here  I ordered the Chicken tortilla soup at 11Am when they first opened as I had a business lunch meeting. It was convenient. I took my first bite and on my second bite something scraped and stabbed my tongue as I forced to keep from swallowing it. OMG! It was a SHARP PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS! Called the server and told her to go to the kitchen and not to serve the soup to anyone then I told her to get her manager. Filled out an incident report since the glass cut my tongue. They did not charge me for my meal BUT NEVER ASKED ME IF I WANTED SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT. So my lunch meeting turned into a water drinking meeting. Then the server had the nerve to tell me that I was still welcome to leave anything behind for her?????!!!!!!????? Really! Corporate office sent me a $50 gift certificate. My tongue was sore and swollen for 10 days and I received $50. What a joke! BJ's San Bruno is only good for their beer and TV's. I will NEVER be back to this BJ's.,2.76,2.59,2.648,1.8600000000000003,2.6579999999999995

Tyler immediately helped my friend and I as we entered happy hour on a busy weds evening. We had  had reservation for 8ppl in the larger part of the restaurant but a few people cancelled and the service was SOOO good we remained in the bar. As our friends trickled in Tyler promptly took their order  he checked on us regularly and even let us know when he went on break. We will surely be back the food an drinks were equally as good!!!!

691,Rhonda D.,Roseville  CA,0,17,,2016-06-19,3.0,We went here for lunch before taking our Paris friends to the airport for their return to France  and it was opening day of Euro Cup 2016 which they did not want to miss. We called ahead to see if they would be playing the game and they told us just to ask and they would make sure it was playing when we came. We arrived and sat in the bar  and the manager worked quickly to not only have it playing  but had it on the huge screen as well as 2 additional screens! Fantastic! For this part we were thrilled. Now  the food is always fairly good at BJ's but at this location we had the same problem as at our local one in Roseville  CA. - sloooow service. It took forever to get our food. The server was very nice and seemed experienced so it wasn't his fault - probably the kitchen. Each time we go - which is fewer and farther between - the service is the same. What's the problem BJ? Get it together! No excuse. Hire more cooks! You make us stay away and we eat out a lot!,2.8,2.6,2.644,2.0280000000000005,2.68
487,C K.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,2.0,2016-06-19,1.0,"Horrible  service and food. Unfortunately I took my boyfriend here for brunch on father\'s day only because he didn\'t want to wait 45 to an hour for all the GOOD food places we stopped at. Like Jacks across the street. We came to bj\'s and sat in the bar area. We waited 10 mins before someone came to clean the table we wanted to sit at and another 20 before someone took our order. Mind you I had to stop someone in the area and ask who\'s the waiter or waitress. After no one acknowledged our presence. That guy ended up taking our order. They were no where near busy. We ordered from the brunch menu. Bj\'s should not have brunch as a part of their menu! Eggs were rubbery and the cheese I asked to be scrambled into the eggs was almost nonexistent ""Apple wood smoked bacon"" was thin like paper and French toast was blah. Coffee was watery. I\'m not a huge fan of Bj\'s already this just confirmed why.",2.64,2.6,2.644,1.8600000000000003,2.616
327,Vivian T.,Outer Sunset  San Francisco  CA,0,1,,2016-06-20,5.0,I came here on a busy Saturday afternoon with my friends and we were seated in the indoor patio area in the mall. Why there was an outdoor patio inside a mall  I'll never know  but it was so worth it because we had the best service through our waiter Matt. He was approachable  kind and attentive with us. I had no idea what to order because I wasn't very hungry  but Matt recommended the Chicken Tacos and it was perfect. I have also been watching my weight for the last few weeks and it was both a tasty and lean meal. He also recommend that my friends and I share a pizzookie for dessert. Probably the best thing I've ever eaten in my entire life! Overall fabulous experience.,2.68,2.64,2.644,2.388,2.656
156,Alex J.,Union City  CA,47,128,61.0,2016-06-21,2.0,The BJ's I've been to in the past have all been solid choices (not mind blowing but not disappointing either). This is the first BJ's that I've been to where I left unhappy. I went prior to a warriors game hoping to enjoy a beer and watch the warriors game. I called ahead to make sure I would be able to get a seat and was told that the wait was only 15 minutes. I reached the restaurant and was told that the wait would be 15 minutes (again). I left my contact number and received a text 1.5 hours after telling me that my table was ready. I came back to try the food and called ahead again and was told that another 15 minute wait would be ahead of me. My girlfriend placed her name on the call ahead list on the app and we were seated immediately (very strange). Once seated  the service was a little slow. We placed our order and the food arrived (slowly). We ordered the seared ahi salad  shrimp and asparagus penne  and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was small but good. The seared ahi dressing was a bit strong (if you do order  dressing on the side might be a smart choice). The shrimp and asparagus penne was strange; the it seemed like the dish was slopped onto the plate. I think they should have remade it because there were BLACKENED asparagus tips in the pasta (clarification: blacked on one side and green on the other side). Our waiter (who was a social butterfly and seemed to tend to the larger parties that were seated next to us) refilled our water  but I kept on noticing black specks in our water....they might have been using a Brita filter which would explain it  but nothing that i couldn't scoop out. But on a good note: Pazookies are good...yum....TL;DR: Not the best food...sometimes solid flavors but perhaps sloppily prepared with semi slow service...Pazkookies are the good point for all BJ's restaurants. I might recommend going to another BJ's location,2.72,2.62,2.632,2.056,2.66
159,Kristine S.,South San Francisco  CA,0,14,8.0,2016-06-22,1.0,Extremely slow service .. For takeout. They forgot the Bacon part of my Bacon burger  so I came back to get what they left out. Then ordered an appetizer because their portions are significantly smaller than I remember. It's been almost half an hour and still no appetizer or stuff that they forgot to put on my burger. They don't seem to have any urgency to update you or apologize that it's taking so long. Meanwhile the rest of the food is getting soggy and cold. Highly disappointed.The servers/hosts have no professionalism  they rather gather around the front counter and talk than pay attention.,2.6,2.62,2.632,2.02,2.612

51,Lynn C.,San Francisco  CA,205,464,1947.0,2016-06-29,2.0,I hardly come to bjs unless im having a pasta craving. I havent gone for awhile and found they discontinued the cajun shrimp pasta. It inclined me to get the chicken fettucine with brocccoli.The pasta was lukewarm. I was so hungry  i let it pass. The pasta wasnt cooked to al dente. It was still hard. There was 4 bits of chicken in it. Dont get me wrong  it was a hefty plate of 2$ worth of pasta. But i expect a chicken breast in a 16$ plate.My bf ordered the ribs with wedges on the side. The ribs were dry and the bbq sauce was subpar. The best thing about dinner was the wedges. They at least made that right  crispy outside  soft inside. He also had clam chowder as well. We expected a small cup of it and were pleased to find it was a large bowl. It was on the salty side but was okay. Didnt come with crackers :(Overall  i have come to the conclusion that bjs is a brewery and specialize in that. The rest is just there. I wouldnt order food unless it was their pizookis or pizza because they specialize in that too and i have had them before just not at this location.If they are going to serve expensive food  they need to make sure every dish they send out is hot and cooked well  not dry  not raw.I dont think ill return for their food. And i dont like beer  so not even for that.,2.48,2.63,2.624,2.024,2.5700000000000003

It was actually one of the best wait staff I've had from a BJ's  super friendly and understanding. Beers were fine  and the appetizer was pretty good (got the Brussel sprouts). The main dish my girlfriend got was the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was atrocious. Breading was falling off  soggy  no seasoning. And they gave us two sides of broccoli instead of the listed broccoli and mashed potatoes. Manager took it off our bill but girlfriend left hungry. Won't be back.,2.4,2.64,2.62,1.956,2.544

There are two waiters during the lunch period that are outstanding  the rest need to go.Food is slow to come out and many time the main entree comes out before the soup. salad etc. Waiters do not have certain areas with tables   but are roaming all over the place covering tables  it is very unorganized.We challenge the management of this place to contact us and let us share our experience with the restaurant etc. While we would hate to go to another venue  this place is becoming more of a 1 star venue than a 5.,2.36,2.64,2.592,2.088,2.528

So the margarita was 19 dollars. Sean asked for Long Island ice tea. It was also weak. Then to top it off one order was skipped. We waited and waited.

Pizza  soup in a sour dough bread were pretty tasty. My Jambalaya was a bit too spicy for my taste  but not bad. Salmon was cooked to perfection.

There's nothing special about this place. The best item they have is the dessert pizooki  but so does Elephant Bar and it's a much better experience.I had to write this review because my wife convinced me to do DoorDash and get it delivered. They forgot to put the Bison burger in the bag so the dasher had to go back and pick it up. When they got back there were no fries with it. Come on  what a waste of time and money.Instead of going here  go to Red Robin in San Bruno. Same type of food  just better and not much of a wait.,2.24,2.65,2.56,1.924,2.486

However  today was not a good day for them.I placed a to go lunch order online at 11:30am and indicated a 12:15pm pick up. I got the BBQ pork sandwich with a side salad. I figured 45 minutes would be enough for one sandwich. WRONG! I got there at 12:10 and was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes  because there were several large orders ahead of mine. I did not leave BJ's with food in hand until 12:55. It took them AN HOUR AND A HALF to cook my one sandwich and a small salad. There were two groups of people ahead of me and each bad 10-15 entrees PER group. So I had to wait while 20-30 entrees were prepped ahead of my ONE sandwich. While I absolutely understand the importance of making orders as they come in  this was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. One sandwich should not have taken an hour and a half to get to a guest. I waited to arrive to pick up my food for 45 minutes  and then I waited another 45 minutes in the restaurant. Not cool. The only plus is that the employee at the take out counter was friendly and kept apologizing and volunteering to go check on my food for me. I will not do a to go order again here.,2.16,2.6,2.56,2.02,2.4240000000000004

Once we made him aware of the double charge  he then SNATCHED the receipt from my mom\'s hand. Rude! He also thought it was important for us to know he ""is being sent home early"" and someone else is taking over. That is no way to transition your customers from one server to another.

After waiting 10-15 minutes and no one coming to our table I went up to the front and asked the hostess to get the manager. I waited there for about 10 minutes and asked again for manager. She said he is in his office and said he should be out soon. I waited up front a while longer and could see the manager coming this way but stopping to talk to some staff along the way. When he finally got to me he asked what I wanted. I told him about the beetle and instead of apologizing he asked what type of beetle it was and what it looked like! When I told him I didn't know what type and did that really matter  it crawled out of the salad! He said he would give me a gift card if that would help. I did take the gift card but I'm not sure if I will ever go to a BJs again and I know for sure I will never go back to this one. This was the worst manager I have ever dealt with and they need to have better kitchen health department checks.,2.32,2.52,2.528,1.604,2.44
435,Sheila M.,Daly City  CA,0,6,4.0,2016-09-04,2.0,First and most likely last time here. Swrvice was very average. We sat waiting for our food for nearly 20 minutes and our server never really checked in to see how we were or let us know what was going on. Yet he was *very* attentive to the table next to us. WTF? Food was not thrilling & when they brought it  one of the sauce containers had spilled all over the entree. Definitely NOT coming back. Ever.,2.32,2.53,2.524,1.704,2.4459999999999997
99,Nikki Q.,San Francisco  CA,103,14,6.0,2016-09-08,2.0,Came here a couple of days ago with the boyf. It was an hour before closing  (& we hate ourselves for being those type of people) but we just wanted a drink & to share a plate. Service here kind of sucked  even though there was barely anyone in the restaurant. We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip. I kid you not  they tried to play me. Literally only half the bowl was full. Being the socially awkward person that I am  I didn't want to complain but three chips in & I could already see the bottom of the bowl. No Bueno. Our waitress saw how little of dip we got but I think she was just hoping we weren't going to say anything. We did & got another small bowl. So not satisfying.,2.28,2.52,2.512,1.8,2.424
602,Lisa K.,San Mateo  CA,0,5,,2016-09-09,4.0,"Stopped in to pick up some food to go with my 92 year old mom on the way back from Kaiser. Of course  she was tired (she\'s 92!)  so when the guy who took our order said 20-25 minutes  she said that was fine  she wanted some books from Barnes and Noble anyway. I set my phone timer for 25 minutes  and when it went off  checked out of the book store and headed back (making it 30 minutes). I was told it would be another 15 minutes or so. I told the guy we weren\'t going to wait  just give me a refund. So the manager comes over and said ""You asked for a manager?"" and I told him no  I just want my money back and be on my way  we can\'t wait any longer. He apologized sincerely  refunded my money  and asked if I could wait ONE more minute. I did  and our food was brought out and given to us free of charge. I honestly wasn\'t expecting a free meal  I was just incensed with the poor service. This has happened before at this BJ\'s with my daughter  and she told me to not leave a tip. I left a tip because I believe it is not the fault of the servers  but is due to poor management and training. The manager that took care of me today was new  and said he was aware of the problem  and was working on it. He handled my situation impeccably! I walked away from there happy and delighted instead of upset and thinking I would never go there again. This new manager is going to get BJ\'s 5 star ratings! Thank you",2.32,2.55,2.524,2.032,2.458
413,L D.,Raleigh  NC,0,37,,2016-09-09,1.0,By far the worst service we have had at a restaurant in a long time. Waiter was happy to take drink orders  awhile later took food and drink refill orders. We were a table of four  it took about 45 mins before everyone was fully served. First food came out after 20 mins  next order 10 mins later and last order 15 mins later  only after we flagged someone down. Then came the drink refills. And the place wasn't even crowded. Only go here if you aren't really hungry or in a hurry. Def we aren't returning. Oh  no apologies from anyone nor a manager-type to visit our table.,2.2,2.54,2.52,1.6360000000000001,2.404
592,Regine L.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,1.0,2016-09-10,1.0,"Terrible Experience. TRISTAN WAS TERRIBLE. We came in on a slow day around 3 PM. We were sat at the balcony section and was approached by our server. He came and did not introduce himself  but instead said ""want somethin\' to drink? Ready for your order? Or did you just sit down?"" All in one breath. Luckily  we\'re regular comers so we knew what we wanted. I ordered strawberry mojito and my friend ordered a strawberry margarita. The strawberry mojito had no alcohol taste but had plenty of soda. I asked for a different drink and it still tasted more as a soda than an alcoholic drink. As for the appetizer  we ordered a lettuce wrap that came with a half-ass presentation of sloppiness. Then he asked if we wanted plates to go with that. Why would you ask if we want plates?! YES WE WANT PLATES. LET ME EAT OFF THE DAMN TABLE. To make matters worse  we also had to ask for silverware and napkins  since he didn\'t give us any. Waited an average of 30 min for our appetizers. Not once did he check up on how the replacement drink was nor the appetizers. For entrees  I ordered a cherry chipotle glazed salmon and my friend ordered a burger. Waited another 40 min. Total wait was more than an hour. Once again  the server did not check up on how our meal was. Our server name was Tristan. DO NOT GET HIM. Oh and he had the audacity to run out and yell if we payed. Ummm.. Do you want to see my receipt?",2.2,2.54,2.52,1.6680000000000001,2.404

The food was perfect  modest portions and speedy service which always makes for a better evening. While enjoying our food we met the manager Debbie young and super sweet woman. Debbie was spot on all night long  let us take our time looking over the menu  answered all questions quickly and well and was very complimentary towards everything .Ambiance at this local is pleasant  noise level is average  staff seems very efficient) food was good  prices decent.

274,Joe P.,South San Francisco  CA,0,3,1.0,2016-09-22,1.0,Came in for a quick lunch after running around in the mall. My wife and I were seated pretty quickly since it was after lunchtime around 2pm. The server took our order fairly quickly after serving us the water and lemonade we asked for as drinks. My wife ordered the spaghetti and meat balls  and I the 'midnight burger'. As we waited for our food  a few minutes go by and we asked our server to add an appetizer  queso dip to our order. No problem so far.We waited  and waited  and close to 30 minutes had gone by and no food  no queso either. Then another person helping the server brings our food to the table. No queso. We asked about the appetizer  and the original server is asking us what we ordered? We simply said no need for appetizer anylonger since food was here already. The seemed to have misplaced our appetizer order.The burger was still warm  but the spaghetti and meatballs were cold  so my wife asks the server to please reheat it. The server takes the dish away. Meanwhile  I am now eating by myself as my wife sitting across from me watches. I eat slow waiting for the spaghetti to return. Waiting. Waiting. Server comes by and says the dish will be brought out by the manager. Waiting. Waiting.Server finally brings the dish back  no manager. My wife now begins to eat  meanwhile I am done and its my turn to watch her eat. Shame  we were supposed to have lunch together. Server says the manager will be by soon to chat with us. Waited. And waited some more.Enough. Asked the server for check. Paid the check and even tipped her (not as much as I would have otherwise). On way out  the manager was by the door  I told him to read Yelp this afternoon about our experience. The manager claimed he was not ware of this.  As we began to leave  on the way out  three servers by the door overhear my comment about Yelp. One of them very pronouncedly began snipping and making remarks about Yelp  and making fun of both my wife and I.We quickly re-entered the restaurant and faced the person  whom quickly left toward the back. We asked for the manager  and explained the treatment we as customers received by the servers representing BJ's. I asked the manager to have the server come out and apologize to my wife. To their credit  the manager and the server both apologized. Its one thing to have mediocre service  and another to ridicule paying customers. To the manager we wish best of luck. To the disrespectful young server  we wish you well too.  We too were young once.  Hopefully we all learned something today...me  to rethink patronizing this BJ's ever again.,2.4,2.57,2.52,1.4440000000000002,2.502
218,Jes W.,Oceanside  CA,18,30,,2016-09-25,1.0,I debated writing this review. We were in last night and I gave it a day to consider. I decided to write it because if I can save someone some cash  I'd like to. We came in last night for dinner and had apps and dinner. Food was subpar  but the server would never know since we barely saw him. It was the worst service I've ever had. I've never contemplated leaving no tip before last night  but I couldn't do that. I was under the impression that if you were a bar server  you had to be a phenomenal employee? We were never checked in  never got refills for drinks  and still spent $57. Unreal. Save your money  go somewhere else. And please BJ's  retrain your service staff.,2.28,2.55,2.512,1.4120000000000001,2.442

Clint really helped make our lunch a good experience.Below was my experience prior to Clint: I am writing this review as I\'m sitting at the restaurant. Usually  the food is pretty good here and service so-so  but today the service has been so slow that it is very frustrating. We\'ve been sitting at our table for 30 minutes and we\'re still waiting for cream and sugar for our coffee even though we\'ve asked our waiter twice. He just put down our appetizer without any plates. Then when he brought us plates it was covered in blue dishwashing liquid. The waiter did not ask me how I wanted my steak and when I remembered  I tried to tell him ""medium"" but he didn\'t appear for so long; when the steak arrived it was extra rare.Another employee came over and explained that he\'s the new manager (Clint). He was very apologetic and explained that he knows there are problems  and that him and new management are trying to fix things. Clint ended up taking care of our table  ensuring that we got clean plates and cutlery  and had the kitchen make me a new steak. Clint checked on us several times and was able to turn what was originally a frustrating lunch into a nice lunch.",2.24,2.54,2.524,1.7440000000000002,2.42

Service at this place horrible  we came in on a Saturday evening  I anticipated it would be busy and it was. The patio had a lot of open seating so we opted to sit out there with the kids. We were seriously looking for other locations to go eat because after we sat outside  it took about 15 minutes for a server to come out. Our server was very nice and professional  the few times we saw her  it appeared she was a little overworked or maybe this place was understaffed. After we ordered our drinks and food  multiple servers came out with a little here and there. When the food finally came  it was cold. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich that I can equate to a gas station grilled sandwich. My wife's personal pizza looked decent  she didn't have any complaints. I like BJ's restaurants but don't be fooled by this one.,2.08,2.49,2.528,1.4120000000000001,2.3260000000000005

130,Stefanie D.,Millbrae  CA,0,1,,2016-10-08,1.0,I had a HORRIBLE take out experience this evening. I ordered food in advance (by 2 hours) on line to be picked up at 5:15pm. My husband and 4 year old went to pick the food up and arrived a few minutes before it was meant to be picked up. The man at the pick up counter  Ernest L.  went to check on the food in the back  came back  and told my husband it wasn't ready. That was it. No other explanation. So my husband asked if he knew an ETA? He said no. And then he continued to help numerous others who went to the counter to pick up their food. My husband stayed near the counter while Ernest would look up at him occasionally. Forty five minutes later  my husband asked again where the food was. He was told it was ready  but they were still waiting for the beignet and ice cream. Seriously?!? The food was cooked at 4:55pm  and my husband hadn't received the food until 6:00pm. By the time we ate it was cold. The fries were soggy. I didn't get the honey mustard I asked for  and one of the items I ordered with my beignet was absent.This was an inexcusable experience with Ernest being a real joke. Never again will we be going to the San Bruno location  and I suggest others do the same since they obviously don't care about their customers.,1.88,2.44,2.516,1.4120000000000001,2.216
35,Cindy C.,San Mateo  CA,410,446,3272.0,2016-10-12,1.0,I don't know - I'm just not a real fan of BJ's. I honestly prefer Red Robins in terms of food.SO wanted to stop here for an early evening dinner before the movies. It started off with waiting 45 minutes for a table. There's almost no seating in the lobby so many patrons just had to stand with kids running around all over the place.Then once we finally got seated and my SO ordered a beer  it was on to more waiting. 15 minutes until our waitress finally came back with the beer and we could order. I remember looking at the clock constantly because I didn't understand how it could take so long to make an appetizer and pour soda on to ice cream. Another 20-30 minutes until our food and my drink came.Finally our California flatbread arrived. It was surprisingly good. Bacon  avocado  and ranch and are a winning combo on anything  but the portion was very small and not filling. Definitely meant to be more of an appetizer.I ordered the orange cream float  that came with free refills  but didn't receive any because our waitress just never looked back after dropping stuff off. It took so long just receive an appetizer and drink  we didn't dare order anything else. We were already late for our movie at that point and just wanted the check. It took 30 minutes to ask for a check and pay. No one paid any attention to us and my SO had to aggressively flag another waiter down.Total of 2 hours. 2 hours to get some flat bread and a drink.

Last year we came here quite often and never had any issues  in fact we used to quite enjoy it. However we both agree the service and food at this location have gone downhill significantly in recent months.To sum up today's lunch experience:- slow  careless  rude service- flat  stale tasting beer- food so terrible we could barely eat any of our appetizer or entreeI noticed we weren't the only guests that were frustrated & unsatisfied.

Asked for the strongest drink on the menu and it was watered down. Calamari was extremely salty. My burger had no sauce in it so it was super dry. No mayo no ketchup or mustard. Just dry. It came with fries that tasted old and stale. I asked for ranch and it was just as watered down as my drink. I should've went with my gut and suggested a different place.

We went because it was online as a sports bar and we wanted to watch the baseball game. There are tv screens all along the perimeter but they are on all different channels. We had to request a table and wait longer to be able to get the area to view the baseball game on a specific tv. My reservation also had the request but we didn't get seated appropriately. Don't ask me why they couldn't change the channel. Anyways  too large and noisy to enjoy a game anyways. No captions on any tv with no volume. Do not go there to watch sports!!!

220,Leilani Z.,Lake Forest Park  WA,704,3,,2016-10-28,2.0,"I know how the restaurant industry works  so I try to be as patient as I can at restaurants. My experience at this location was very poor. We sat in the open seating bar area around 4pm and didn\'t get greeted until 413. Before then I had to get up and grab menus myself from the host. Since we knew what we wanted right away  we ordered with our first waiter. I get this is transition time  so 10 mins later the same server came by and introduced us to Lovely and said she will be taking care of us. Cool  no problem. We should be getting our drinks in 5 mins now. Nope. Add another 10 mins and we finally got our first order of drinks. For the rest of our evening our server checked in with us maybe every 15 mins. Or was at least in the same vicinity every 15 mins. So when I wanted to order my last drink  I had to bother a different server with a different section to have our server see us. I am not familiar with this menu  and on the first page of beers it shows one stout. I figured you guys only offered one stout so I ordered ""one stout please."" It wasn\'t the one I thought I was getting. My server should have specified which stout I wanted... Unless she is just new? She should ask what kind especially for beers  or any kind of alcohol that has different flavors with its (example  beer) family. To me  this problem is the same as me ordering ""one beer please""... Obviously the waiter/bartender would respond  ""which kind?"" Also  I know I could have approached my server to solve this solution but it wasn\'t until I got my bill that I realized the stout situation. Overall  I\'ll still come to a BJ\'s  but never this location again. Although this leaves me skeptical that other locations have this same inattentive service....",1.84,2.3,2.496,1.224,2.116

257,Vanessa M.,San Francisco  CA,35,4,1.0,2016-10-29,1.0,The worst service ever !!!! Came in at 9 and left at 11 just because my food didn't arrive until 10:25. Never,1.68,2.26,2.476,1.1880000000000002,2.028

58,Anny W.,San Francisco  CA,421,148,60.0,2016-11-05,2.0,"Once in a while  I\'m craving something hearty. So I suggested to eat here for dinner on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. First off  the wait was 50 minutes. Fine- I get it if the restaurant was packed. I walked by the windows that were faced towards the mall and saw a whole row of empty tables/seats. That could\'ve easily fitted 4 parties of 4 and 4 parties of 2. How is that even efficient? 50 minutes passed and I didn\'t get a text. I went to check with the host and he got extremely defensive about it:""Sorry mam. I gave you 50 minutes as a estimated time that you\'ll be seated. We can\'t do anything to make it any faster. We have customers who are just sitting there after dinner. You will just have to wait.""That was a total uncalled for response but whatever. My boyfriend and I sat in the waiting area for another 10 minutes. So the total wait time was WHOLE HOUR.The waiter that served us was not attentive and seemed to be all over the place. We ordered appetizers  soup  beer and two entrees. I can officially reward this BJ to be the longest wait time in the world for an appetizer. We waited a whole 30 mins for Avocado Spring Rolls. To put the cherry on top  we didn\'t have any utensils OR plates. I had to ask the waiter TWICE for it. Then my boyfriend\'s beer came  he just slammed it down and walked away! Maybe he felt bad and came back to ""check"" up on us to see how we liked our egg rolls.If you plan on getting the steak with sides of veggies  please do yourself a favor and pass on it. The veggies were really dry and overcooked with no seasoning. I got the bacon avocado burger and my waiter didn\'t even ask how I wanted my patty to be cooked. I got a well done burger patty and I only eat medium rare! Total fail.When it was time to pay  I asked the waiter for two box and a check. He was wandering around and checking up on tables around us. He saw me glaring at him and he already forgot to give me the things I\'ve asked for. I waved my hands to get his attention to ask where\'s the box and check? He apologized and said he totally forgot *rolls eyes*.He came back and said the printer ran out of receipt paper so he has to get his manager to re-print it the receipt. This means ANOTHER wait?! Omg someone please pass me a beer.This was my fifth time visiting BJ at this location and I vow to never return. The last time I went  they forgot about utensils  plates and the wait time for the food was ridiculous as well.The management needs to step their game up because Red Robin is nearby and they can steal your customers and business in a heart beat.",1.68,2.23,2.484,1.224,2.0100000000000002
376,Ana O.,Miami  FL,0,7,5.0,2016-11-06,1.0,I'm on vacation and this place was convenient. What a terrible experience this was. From the service to food quality  everything lacked. Our order was wrong  very delayed and consequently it was cold when it got here. We asked for the manager twice. When she finally got here she was very apologetic and covered the bill. Overall a bad experience.,1.6,2.2,2.476,1.092,1.9600000000000004
393,Jim C.,San Francisco  CA,0,4,,2016-11-06,1.0,Absolutely horrible experience. Ordered large pepperoni pizza  got slab of dough with almost no sauce and only a little cheese.

354,alexandria s.,San Francisco  CA,5,42,,2016-11-07,1.0,I went with my friends to celebrate our birthdays. The service was lacking. It took a long time to get our drinks and our food. Food was cold. My friend's salad had wilted lettuce and chew holes in it--I do not know how that got past quality control. We had like 3 different people serving our table and they did not know what was going on with our order--really big lack of communication. We ordered an entre to go and twice they brought it out on a plate. We asked for our dessert like 3 times before we got it and it took forever to get it. The bill took a long time as well we had to keep asking for it. The lady at the table next to us  kept having to ask for her drink. It was an overall unpleasant experience :(,1.6,2.17,2.464,1.22,1.942

I ordered a medium rare steak and got medium well.... when I told him to it was wrong he disappeared for a good hour and a half . Not only was my order wrong but the whole party's order was wrong. He wasn't around much to help us fix it. He didn't come to check on us. Another server is now taking care of us. We got here at 5:30 and it's now 8:32 and we are currently here because NICK sucked.

139,Justin J.,Daly City  CA,504,7,4.0,2016-11-12,2.0,I don't have high expectations when I go to BJ's. I love the traditional wings and for the most part that's one thing I can order that consistently comes out the same. This last visit I decided on starting with a different appetizer.... disaster.I ordered spinach stuffed mushrooms ... kinda. What came out barely resembled what I thought I was getting. These were mushrooms the way raisins are grapes. The service was good  but the food was so disappointing  even the wings couldn't save this trip. It was pretty sad  reminded me of how I felt after hearing the election results this year.,1.64,2.14,2.452,1.3519999999999999,1.94

When we entered there was no one to greet us  there was NO clean tables and the ones that were clean were closed  the bartender couldnt recommend a good fruity drink so he handed me a novel which is the menu and.its printed so small you cant read it. Now we have been to many BJs especially Stockton where the food is AWESOME and so is the service. We finally got a table with no help from the staff and was ready to order  OUR Server Rob showed up with the brightest smile and personality which made things much more bearable. The bathroom was disgusting and no stalls had toilet paper. This was the worse experience ever.,1.64,2.11,2.452,1.3160000000000003,1.922

All of our meals first came out really burnt 20 minutes ago so we sent it back. And now we are still waiting for our food to come back out.If you want really good food and better service.

As soon as they see you are not alone  they decide to disrespect you and call you every name in the book. Best part of it all  the manager Andrew (or whatever his ""real name is"" (good job on hiring practices BJs) tells you that you are kicked out for standing up for yourself.

You know the service is bad now there.And I agree  The service is just super bad now. Besides the wait time where I was willing to wait anyways before because of the service and good food it's just not worth it now. The jambalaya is so disappointing .it's just full of green bell peppers that's it. The servers .. oh my I don't know they just look so unhappy to be there and it just reflects cause they don't care ... they don't care about the costumersBJs   seriously good thing you guys got the franchise name but oh my .

When we came in tonight we waited 25 minutes to be seated  neither of us minded. Our waiter was amazing and very helpful  but when it came to the food it was DISGUSTING and I would never come back because of it. I ordered a gluten free bacon guacamole burger  when it came out the first time it was on a regular bun...our waiter took it back and was greatly apologetic for the mistake. We waited 15 more minutes while his food was on the table getting cold. When I received my food again the bun was hard as a rock  I told our waiter and he offered to get me a new bun but I was so hungry I declined and contributed eating. As I took a bite nearing the center of the burger I found myself with a mouthful of cold uncooked ground beef. Although the staff was willing to make amends for the food  I would never come back again.,1.6,2.04,2.416,1.5400000000000003,1.8640000000000003

Wait time was over an hour to get seated. We get seated and there\'s no menus or utensils waiting for us. We had to grab them ourselves bc our server ran off somewhere. They forgot my daughter\'s meal  and her friend\'s meal and that took over an extra hour from when everyone started eating. The waitress said she ""forgot"" and apologized. What\'s the point in writing orders down and making that excuse. Also  when we had to check on the missing orders  we had to ask a different server - bc ours was no where in site. He had to place the order bc there was none made by her. I don\'t know why I came in expecting this place to be different  but I guess it did change- it got worse. If you have a LOT of time to spare  are with a small group and like to be literally left alone by any service- then come here.",1.6,2.04,2.408,1.5400000000000003,1.8640000000000003
276,Chelsea C.,Yolo  CA,0,17,1.0,2016-11-26,1.0,I love BJs but this place has one of the worse service ever. The guy hardly checked on us. We were literally done with our main meals and waited for 15-20mins before our server came by to check on us. He forgot he ranch after asking 3x. Ordered an extra side of fries when I asked for just an extra side of ranch and charged us for it. Forgot about my friends order who had a pazookie that came with her meal. Waited 10mins for our dessert. Another 10-15mins to get her dessert. Never refilled our drinks till the very end  asking us and we were done with our meal. He was no existent. We literally stayed there for a 2 hours when it should've been only 1 hour. Horrible. It's the holidays so I won't say our servers name but I hope he gets reprimanded for the crappy service he gave us.,1.44,2.03,2.404,1.5400000000000003,1.7939999999999998
166,Rachel R.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,42,8,5.0,2016-11-28,1.0,If I could give this place no stars I would. Not only did we have three different servers come tell us they were taking over for the other but none of them asked for our drinks until we were sitting down for ten minutes. Then when we did order they took forever to bring our food. Naturally we asked for ketchup and some extra sauces which did not come till we were all done eating. Our drinks were not refilled the entire meal and neither of the three servers who said they were taking our table checked on us. You would think that getting the check would be the easiest thing but they couldn't even get that to us. We eat out quite a bit and had friends with us from out of town. This was by far the worst service we have encountered. I would rather drive to another location than come back here.,1.36,2.02,2.396,1.604,1.7560000000000002
134,Luke Y.,Elk Grove  CA,19,74,9.0,2016-11-28,1.0,I love eating at BJ's restaurants and stop at this location when I'm in town. This place isn't warm n cozy like others. Their front staff/ host are always looking unhappy. The food doesn't taste great like other locations. The veggies still had dirt from the field on it  when I told the lady she just threw it away. But that's all I have to say!,1.36,2.0,2.392,1.604,1.7440000000000002

199,Jess M.,Corona  CA,4,9,4.0,2016-11-29,1.0,Worst service here. I came here after a flight and waited ten minutes at my booth before I was even greeted by my waiter. I had to get up and find someone who was sitting on a counter to get my server. There were easily ten employees that walked by without any regard to me as I say waiting. Needless to say  if I wasn't so hungry I would have left. So disappointed in the service here. No thanks!,1.32,1.95,2.388,1.7000000000000002,1.698
415,Don M.,Corona  CA,0,6,5.0,2016-11-30,1.0,If I could give it a zero I would. This is not typical of service I would expect at this restaurant. This was a not overly crowded night at all  we were seated immediately. I had to get up out of my seat and ask another server to locate my server after several servers passed by. The service was slow  And although our server was nice it was overshadowed by the slowness and inattention to getting orders serving the food and overall non-customer friendly atmosphere. food was OK  at least we didn't get sick  and my strawberry lemonade was lukewarm with approximately five ice cubes in it. I had to ask for water twice before I received it after another long delay. there was no silverware at the table. When I receive good service  I will be the first to write about it  but the service was absolutely unacceptable. If not for the fact we just arrived out of town on a flight and had no other restaurant alternatives nearby we would've gotten up and left. I intend to write the corporate office and hope that this location will be contacted and some additional training or soft skills maybe offered to it's employees. if I could have located a manager I would have expressed my concerns and dissatisfaction to them but there was none to be found.

Matt took our order for food and beverages and both came in a timely manner. He finished his shift during our meal and introduced us to Asia  his replacement. We received thoughtful service from her. I had finished my food but asked for more water. Asia brought 2 waters in to go cups so that we could take it with us. My husband needed a box for his left over French Dip sandwich. She provided a container for that as well as one for the au jus without us asking  which is rare in any restaurant.,1.36,1.94,2.368,2.192,1.7080000000000002

109,Dorothy B.,Los Angeles  CA,3,17,32.0,2016-12-08,1.0,I like BJs but not this one.I went out last night with my husband and friend. We ordered an appetizer plate  2 burgers and battered mushrooms along with 3 drinks.The appetizer plate came out first and all of the fried items (chicken wings/mozzarella sticks) were cold. We ate the rest of the items in hope of teaching down our waiter but he was no where to be found. A different server brought us our food but we didn't have any utensils. When I asked for then she brought paper napkins but no rolled utensils. I had to go ask a different server for the utensils before we were able to eat.The burgers were sub par. My husbands was good but my roommates bun was extremely dry and everything was super oily.The family behind us was complaining about their meal S well. The server only came back to ask if we wanted more to drink and never asked us how our food was. When I asked for the check he gave us the wrong persons bill then came back to return ours. Normally I don't complain  maybe he was having a bad day  or maybe he has too many tables. But overall service from all wait staff wasn't good. I got home and I felt sick. I ended up getting food poisoning and was throwing up violently throughout the rest of the night. I don't recommend this location to even my worst enemy. If your craving BJs go to a different location.,1.28,1.88,2.336,1.8920000000000003,1.6400000000000001
129,Shira S.,San Francisco  CA,57,17,8.0,2016-12-10,1.0,I came here after shopping with my mom and dad. We have come a few times before (maybe 3-4 times)  years ago  and we remembered enjoying it. Sure  it wasn't AMAZING but we didn't really have any complaints. After come here today  we will not go back. You're better off going to the food court.After entering we should have left. There was a smell of grease and fish (not fresh fish  which I can handle  but almost an unclean  old fishy smell that turns you off food).We ordered a tea and coffee first (both were lackluster in taste - quite frankly the worst coffee ive had). Granted they are not particularly known for tea/coffee  it just was bad. All three of us ordered burgers. My dad got the bison burger(comes with coleslaw) and my mother and I both got the bacon cheese burger (comes with fries). Immediately upon seeing our dish come  we noticed how greasy the fries were. Little did we know  the fries were the best part (and they were pretty bad). The burgers were cold. Like... barely warm cold. Tr buns were cheap  not very tasty. The beef was eh  theyre a decent size but lack flavor. They dont skimp on the lettuce  tomato and pickles which I guess is good? My mom only took two bites. We should have sent them back but didnt want to make a fuss (though given the price for cold food...). Maybe it was an off day  but given the other reviews  I doubt it.,1.24,1.88,2.336,1.924,1.624

189,Jon T.,San Francisco  CA,108,10,4.0,2016-12-14,1.0,I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip as a starter. The dip had a layer of oil settled on the top and the nachos were soaked in the oil that it was fried in I couldn't even finish because it was so greasy. The deep dish pizza (if you can even call it that) tasted like it was from pizza hut with the crispy oily crust and one thin layer of toppings. The opened faced late night burger with the chile verde was a weird combo and the two flavors just didn't go well together. When I lifted the bun off the plate it was glistening and dripping with grease. The meal was quite disappointing and I definitely won't be going back for the food.,1.44,1.88,2.328,1.924,1.7039999999999997

Being that I am a gluten-free girl  it's always a dilemma of where to eat (gluten is hidden everywhere  not just in bread). Low and behold  BJ's has gluten free items on the menu. Even better  they have gluten-free hamburger buns. This made my day so I ordered a burger. The burger was good. Instead of fries (yes  they can be gluten-filled if tossed in flour) I got a house salad instead. The salad was a good size and very good. My overall experience was great. Our waiter was also excellent. I would go back again. Also  the prices are very reasonable.,1.8,1.93,2.352,2.256,1.8780000000000001

My reservation was confirmed and they even took my contact information down.When we arrived  we were told my reservation was lost and they had a larger party of 40+ people and wouldn't be able to accommodate our party.

For the price  we should have received an appetizer that could be shared. The size served could have been eaten by one person and they still would have left hungry. We also order a BJ Favorites Deep Dish pizza. In my opinion this is not a deep dish pizza and the name should be changed. This is a ""Thick Crust"" pizza and not deep dish. Was disappointed to discover that it was nothing but a bunch of bread with minimal toppings and sauce. It was just okay in flavor. The tomatoes need to me omitted or substituted for fresh tomatoes. They tasted like they were canned tomatoes. Also had a beer and cider. The carbonation is way off. The cider tasted more like soda. The stars all go to the young lady (Daniela  I think).

The hostess just looked at our group and didn't say a word and expected us to read her mind. We didn't even know if she was showing us to our spot or another group. 3. Sat down and did't get helped helped for 17 minutes..4. Ordered and waters took another 7 minutes 5. Drinks came back and one was missing 6. Avocado egg rolls were great no complaints here7. Ordered side salads and they didn't come out... 8. After another 30 min we asked about them and she blamed the ticket getting lost 9.

Between the drinks being wrong  the food delivery staggered andoverall  taking forever  good bye BJ's.....what a mess  bigly.I love this place. Wonderful atmosphere  the food is top drawer  and the service is crisp. So  why two stars? Got my salad  my wine and then into the twilight zone. No food  then  no food  then  no food  then I complained  then  food.I don't know who is responsible for the kitchen but they need to be fired or given additional training.The place wasn't particularly busy  but the wait for food was eternal.

I am usually a huge fam of BJ's but this one fell short. The waitress was extremely rude when we had to continuously ask for water and once we finally got our stuff we still got attitude because she was frustrated with us when we tried our best to organize our orders.

It was no big deal but then we asked if we could ask for happy hour prices  the waiter was great but said he would ask the manager because we had an unexpected wait time; then the manager comes out and says she would comp an appetizer  which really confused us because we were looking to pay and had no complaint at first...she comps is wings and hours later we're having diarrhea and nausea.

I've been here several times with coworkers. They always have sports on TV and usually there are seats open in the bar area. I like the bison burger  lower calories than many items on their menu and it tastes really flavorful. I love the sangria that they have in the menu  pro tip  try it blended!!,2.4,1.86,2.324,2.6399999999999997,2.076

When we arrived we were told it was a 20-25 minute wait  which did not bother us. We were actually happy that they take down our phone number so they could text you when your table is ready. Our waiter was courteous  but we could tell he hated his job. He forgot my daughter\'s order (because he didn\'t write it down) and didn\'t give us utensils until 10 min after we were served our food. Sad to say this is typical for restaurants in malls  don\'t expect warm and happy people working here lol.",2.32,1.85,2.332,2.444,2.0380000000000003
46,Ti S.,San Francisco  CA,106,140,131.0,2017-02-25,1.0,Friday 2/24/17 around 11pm.Wow  where to begin? Co-hostess/usher makes comment in front me (paying customer  mind you) that she has to bring another party to their table. Yup! No professionalism or customer service here. Chili came out luke warm. Just from the looks of the spinach and artichoke dip (warm)  I already knew it would disappoint. The dip had an extremely liquidy consistency. I can only describe the dish to look like light green milk with bits and pieces of spinach and artichoke. Is there a spinach shortage that I'm unaware of? First thought in my head was there must be lack of staffing in the kitchen. I had the full rack of ribs (actually hot) with fries and chili. The ribs were the most edible item I had there all night. Fries were doused with salt (extremely over seasoned).The bf had the ribeye steak with Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. After trying a piece of the Brussel sprout  I dare not try the rest. It was probably frozen  reheated  frozen again  and reheated until overcooked. Granted our beverages came out way later (no refills on waters or soda)  our utensils came out way later  and our condiments came out way later  we were shocked we actually even got the items. All and all  one of the most terrible dining experience yet. Never expected this from a known establishment. First time here after a few years and this experience just reminds me of why I shall never return.,2.28,1.85,2.32,2.244,2.0220000000000002

It's super packed and seems like they cant hire good servers or the kitchen is backed up. Either way  if your looking for good service and quality food  I would go across the street to Jacks.

( if you don't remeber write it on a piece a paper geez!)food- we waited probably like 50 min  that is a long time and when it arrive it was so cold and we sent back. They made it again and it was disgusting.Their food went downhill  i dont remeber the food tasting this horrible. even though manager didnt make us pay for the appetizer or the dessert  i would not come back not worth the wait or the food.,2.24,1.87,2.312,2.436,2.0180000000000002

To make good on the situation  the Manager offered us 2 free pizookies. When I went to pick up the gift  we actually were given a gift card and a free pizookie. Very nice gesture from the Manager cuz we weren't even going to say anything. Then 2 days later  after his time off  the Manager followed up to ensure we received our compensation. Very pleased with the service and follow up treatment. Always happy with our food from BJ's restaurant. Thank you for the good service.,2.2,1.9,2.308,2.7359999999999998,2.02

428,Jay D.,Concord  CA,93,37,1.0,2017-03-15,1.0,So I have a number of issues I have experienced during the last month which is funny since we go on non peak times when most of the staff are just standing around. Being the supposed decent dessert place opened late in San Bruno  its not like there is another alternative to go elsewhere so apparently give BJs more chances than it deserves  though HOOTER's San Bruno has permanently burned a page in my book. Honestly you'd think the pazookie was one they have mastered and could not screw up. WRONG! So we ordered a total of 5 pazookies  which normally they are cooked well with crispy bottoms. though these was really doughy  had a grainy consistency and by morning I at least know two of us experienced stomach issues. It honestly does not seem like things will get better  which I agree with other posts that if it wasn't the closest thing that sold dessert opened late  it probably wouldn't still be in business. You can view by amount of dislike for the brand that if another late night spot like a buffalo wild wings came in that it would destroy the BJs since people like Diane who work there give it a lousy name though she is one of a few people who work for the BJs brand who experience a piss poor attitude and lack of urgency that they experience more time fraternizing and ignoring the request of their clientle. Probably also would have been better if they at least acted like they wanted to help and smiled. I hope BJs does what Chipotle did and hold a company wide meeting to improve quality and the face of their brand. Oh and I forgot to add that my appetizers tend to be non existent since they usually are burnt beyond the point of where they can even be consumed where my potato skins essentially were literally just the skin since they were burnt to the point where the potato itself didn't exist anymore.,2.32,1.92,2.328,2.2760000000000002,2.08
40,Mark R.,South San Francisco  CA,80,104,231.0,2017-03-19,1.0,This place really disappoints me. First the hostess was unfriendly. My family and i wanted to sit outside and she said they don't sit people outside till 5pm. I told her its 4:55pm and she said that's not 5pm. And she said the wait to be seated outside was 30 mins. So we're sitting there waiting around 5:15 I saw the other hostess starting to put people outside. I was thinking they had a reservation. After ten minutes I went up the the hostess that I was talking to earlier and I asked her about the outside tables. She said she forgot to text me and we're next. No sorry from the hostess. Our waiter looks like she didn't want to be there. Our food looks good but my order didn't look like what was on the menu. My order looks like it came from the kids menu. The portion was so small. Sorry BJs but you failed and we won't be back.,2.32,1.92,2.312,2.2760000000000002,2.08
385,Cathy G.,San Bruno  CA,19,43,,2017-03-20,2.0,I used to really love coming to BJ's  but the last few times I have come  it just has not been that good. Today was by far the worst service I think I have ever had. My daughter and I arrived before 3:00 to find the hostess on the phone  which is fine...she stated that she would be just a minute. Also fine. At least she acknowledged us. Fortunately there was a couple of servers up by the host station  and one of them seated us. Our waiter came almost immediately  which was awesome. My problem starts after we actually placed our order. Because of a rainy day  my daughter and I decided to stick with the chicken tortilla soup. Great soup kind of day. Gave our order to our waiter and proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for two bowls of soup. When it arrived  the bowls had hardly any soup in it and what was there was barely Luke warm. Mine had one piece of chicken and one tortilla strip in it. My daughter at least got two chicken pieces in hers  but alas  no tortilla strips. It's really too bad because the tortilla soup is really good! I also had a cup of coffee  which no one ever came back to see if I wanted a warm up or another cup. Our waiter only came back to give us the bill  which he promptly picked up. Took a while to get it back though. By this point  we could hardly wait to leave. I was really very disappointed today,2.32,1.93,2.312,2.3760000000000003,2.086

Our server was patient with me and my friends since we barely know what flavor to order  and since we want to hit 3 birds in one stone  our server offered us the pizookie trio which comes in three different flavors. They have bar area and a porch/patio with fire place too! We'll definitely come back!,2.48,1.94,2.316,2.7399999999999998,2.156

Fire and hire new staff past and present if BJ's General Manager don't get it together the restaurant will close. Hire me I'll have the best team  bring revenue  and great food in 2 weeks flat.

408,Ema M.,San Mateo  CA,0,11,,2017-03-28,1.0,This place is ridiculous. I called on a Saturday and asked them if they would Be able to accommodate a party of 9. They said it would take an hour  so I put my name on their wait list  showed up an hour later and when checking in they told us they can only seat us in two separate booths that are next to each other. I had explained to them that when speaking to someone who put my name and party size on the wait list that I was not told it would be in booths. The host called over the manager and she talked to the host right in front of us and then the host relayed the message  the manager didn't even have the curiosity to talk to us (we were literally standing two feet away). The host said their tables were booked for the whole night and said they only had booths and told us to next time tell them we want a table. Why would a party of any size want to go out to eat to be seated separately ?! Needless to say we had to find a restaurant last minute to accommodate our party.,2.48,1.95,2.3,2.116,2.162
76,Olivia H.,San Francisco  CA,137,55,9.0,2017-03-28,3.0,"The food is good and exactly what you would expect from a BJs. My friends and I are partial to their appetizers  particularly the spinach artichoke dip and Sriracha Brussels sprouts. It\'s not necessarily the restaurant\'s fault  but this place is consistently overcrowded. Wait times in any time approaching dinner are out of this world  and we have frequently left after discovering it would take over an hour and a half to seat two diners. Since the service is generally slow  it\'s not too surprising that they cannot open up tables more quickly. Unfortunately  they don\'t take reservations  either  so there is little chance to get ahead of the rush. I tried the ""priority waitlist"" option they now offer throught the BJs app  and they did not grant us any priority  and one host acknowledged they had forgotten our names had even been put in. The menus are sticky  and requests to change TV channels are rarely honored  although they claim they will do it. It\'s an overcrowded American-style chain restaurant--sometimes the tasty bar-food apps are worth it  sometimes they\'re not.",2.56,1.96,2.304,2.348,2.2

First off- they have HH until 7  where I can get their jalapeo margarita for less than $7. Score. Their bar bites are good as well.

But the service was very poor and our waitress didnt say one word to us or even smile! We didnt have silverwear for the first 20 minutes of our meal but the food was fairly decent! I would not recommend this place unless you want to watch some tv and have a drink!!,2.68,1.98,2.3,1.924,2.2600000000000002

I felt so bad for my mom because her entree was not a pleasant experience at all :( atleast my entree was good so we shared mine :),2.68,2.0,2.296,2.2199999999999998,2.2720000000000002
75,Michael L.,Daly City  CA,409,36,36.0,2017-04-20,5.0,Haven't been to a bjs in around 5 years. Only went because I had a gift card that was given to me and a coupon for $10 off $35. Man was I surprised. We got the prime rib special and a breakfast omelet to meet the $35. The prime rib also came with a pizookie and soup which we got the clam chowder. The food came. Wife and I pretty much only finished the prime rib items because there was so much food. Clam chowder was a huge bowl and had a generous portion of clams. Prime rib was huge and the pizookie was delicious. Ate the breakfast food for dinner. Very satisfied.,2.84,2.04,2.312,2.42,2.36
147,Willis W.,South San Francisco  CA,80,3,,2017-04-22,5.0,We've been coming here for a few years. The food and service has been on an upswing in the past few months. Come for the food  stay for the service. Recent menu changes have been for the better too. They have legitimately great prime rib. If you don't want the full dinner  you can get the prime rib sandwich. Definitely worth a try. They do sometimes sell out as the demand is growing. Definitely worth a trip or a retry if you quit coming more than a few months ago.,2.92,2.08,2.328,2.324,2.416
210,Wayne Y.,Daly City  CA,0,12,3.0,2017-04-23,1.0,Ordered Gourmet Five Meat Deep Dish pizza. The only taste is salt. Ordered Crispy Calamari. The portion was really small; you can fit the calamari into a small McDonald's french fry bag. The calamari was barely warm  and was soggy  not crispy.,2.92,2.08,2.312,1.7960000000000003,2.416
123,Ximena C.,Daly City  CA,11,33,19.0,2017-04-24,2.0,A manager named Eugene reached out to me to apologize which I really appreciated. He really owned the negative experiences and assured me that he would hold his staff accountable. Really  the only way to see if he's sincere is to give the place another try  which I may. For his follow up  I give them back a star.,2.84,2.09,2.316,1.9600000000000002,2.39
42,J M.,San Francisco  CA,3,98,164.0,2017-04-27,4.0,I figure I left my two star review on here long enough  since it was all about a disappointing hamburger  which I won't order again. But since then  I've eaten many different menu items  most with satisfying results. My favorites are the thick and juicy pork chop  the weekend prime weekend special and the spare ribs. I also like the buffalo wings as an appetizer. Other good dishes are the shrimp and mahi mahi tacos and the Californian grilled chicken with avocado sandwich. Service is typically above average  with few exceptions. And sometimes the food delivery is not spaced well  but it's not a perfect world either. I still come often  so that says a lot.,2.84,2.12,2.328,2.16,2.408
221,Tamara W.,Lee's Summit  MO,0,1,,2017-04-30,2.0,BJs is a busy place. The staff is nice and was extremely busy. The food was fair to ok. I ordered a well done bacon cheddar burger. The burger was pink throughout on an oversized bun with hints of aged lettuce. On the plus side  the Jamison Amber Ale was good.,2.72,2.13,2.332,1.864,2.366
137,Allison T.,San Mateo  CA,0,22,,2017-04-30,1.0,Horrible service. Went with several family members and ignored for twenty minutes just to even get seated. Finally seated and then 20 minutes go by before we even see a server. Waitress helped a table literally right next to us that were seated around the same time as us but we were totally ignored. our food took way too long and thanks to the missing waitress we had to get up and hunt someone down to ask where our food was twice! The icing on the cake was that the food sucked definitely tasted like it had been sitting under food lamps and forgotten about. Pizookie was hard and disappointing. They even had the gall to charge us. Poor poor service. Stay far far away!! In hindsight we should have just got up and left.Oh and this was for a visit yesterday evening 4/29/17,2.72,2.13,2.328,1.7320000000000002,2.366
104,Abby C.,San Francisco  CA,30,148,90.0,2017-05-01,1.0,This BJ's has horrible service and staff. Starting with the host station. The quality of food is also horrible. Compared to the other BJ locations this one has probably been the worse location I have visited. I wanted to give it two stars and I've visited this location a few times  especially during football games and HH prices. But each time I went they always messed up on our orders  overcharged us and added plates to our bill. Also  many times our calamari would come out burnt and the portion would be less and less every time. I would understand if the calamari was on the HH menu then yes  smaller HH portion but it wasn't. All servers are pretty rude and careless to help other tables and even there own. Takes awhile to flag your own server down too  and when you do expect to wait another 30-25mins for water  peppers and new silverware. ALWAYS check your silverware  there never cleaned and have food on them still  yuk. If the Oreo Pizookie wasn't so yummy  I probably wouldn't have returned.,2.72,2.13,2.328,1.7960000000000003,2.366
141,Gustavo B.,Fremont  CA,0,8,,2017-05-03,4.0,Been coming here for a while. The service has gotten better back and fourth. We were sat in the a booth today and waited for service. No one came for about 10-15 minutes so we waived the manager Rustie down. Rustie ended up taking our order and getting everything for the us. Food came out quicker than usual and dessert came out quick. he offered us a pizzokie when we downloaded the app. Which we took of course. LOVE IT!!!,2.8,2.13,2.34,2.128,2.398

145,Monica M.,Millbrae  CA,0,11,1.0,2017-05-07,1.0,Super inconsistent. The servings are definitely not worth the money. If you are taking out to go  you are more than guaranteed to be skimped. If you get a soup  be aware that you are paying $6.75 for less than half of the cup that they serve it in  literally 4 scoops and your $7 soup is done. Unless you get the bread bowl  even then they don't fill up the cup all the way. Obviously to worried about losing money but I mean they definitely are because they just lost another customer.,2.64,2.13,2.328,1.7640000000000002,2.334
125,rob a.,San Francisco  CA,135,17,5.0,2017-05-09,1.0,Salad and soup are not unlimited here. Server said she'll be back but saw her after 20 min without my second soup and salad! It was mid day. Not even busy. Ordered from a kids menu for a 3 year old and he didn't get his chocolate milk until we were all done eating and ready for the bill. The server had never checked on us to see if we needed anything else  had to flag down the other server to get our attention. Very Bad service!!,2.56,2.13,2.328,1.8280000000000003,2.302
68,Alex B.,Oyster Point  CA,47,24,,2017-05-12,2.0,I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes  it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar  I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately  food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes  but of course  there are shining exceptions. The food is decent for the most part  with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times  and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard  but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas.While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller  contrarily  entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much  but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable.Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food  but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth.,2.6,2.1,2.328,1.9280000000000002,2.3000000000000003
97,Leticia C.,Paso Robles  CA,11,1,,2017-05-17,2.0,Our waiter was great! Took our order promptly and very polite. Food was good. Had a Cesar salad and pizza. It was the seating that was not cool! Checked in and told it would be a 10-minute wait. Mind you  there were plenty of 2- seat tables available. During our wait another couple checked in. While we waited another couple walked in and before they could check in they were asked if they were 2  which they confirmed and they were escorted to a table by the manager. The other couple called it discrimination. Didn't cross my mind until I realized the couple they sat without checking in and the 4 of us that were still waiting. FYI  this is not the first time this has happened at this particular restaurant. Sad and disgusted with BJ's in San Bruno!!!!!!!!,2.56,2.09,2.328,1.9600000000000002,2.278
196,Iris B.,San Francisco  CA,0,11,,2017-05-18,5.0,I made dinner reservations for a high-school baseball team of 20 and a group of 12 parents. We arrived early but Efraim  the manager on duty  was able to quickly accommodate us. I believe he helped with setting the tables and designated one or two waitresses for our party only. They were friendly and patient and available when we wanted something. Everyone was served in a timely manner and there were no mistakes with the orders. The food was good  something for everyone  and Efraim stopped by to make sure everything was to our liking. Upon our way out he came to say goodbye and thank us for our visit. Super service  great food. Thank you!,2.6,2.13,2.336,2.356,2.318
120,Michael N.,Daly City  CA,71,46,4.0,2017-05-21,3.0,I like the new menu and the diverse offerings. It makes me want to come back and try different things. I just wish the service was better. My server started off well enough  but kept forgetting things after that. I had to ask for more water even though my glass was nearly empty. They brought the wrong side dish for my daughter. After I pointed it out  they made us wait only to bring the same wrong side dish again! I mean  really. I asked for a box for the leftovers  twice. I had a coupon that wasn't reflected on the bill. And so on. If they cared just a little they could get it right. I had a hard time tipping 15% today.,2.68,2.14,2.344,2.0280000000000005,2.3560000000000003
184,Rosallie B.,Half Moon Bay  CA,0,7,,2017-05-24,5.0,Came in on a Tuesday right before the dinner rush. Did not have to wait for seating for a table of four. Anthony was our server and he did an excellent job  he made sure are drinks were filled  also checked back to the table often  overall great customer service. Food was delicious!

122,Cheryle M.,Patterson  CA,0,1,2.0,2017-05-25,1.0,I dont live in this city but often stay in the area when I'm on a business trip. I really liked BJs until we visited this one. We were immediately seated but once seated  the only time our waitress came back to our table was to take our chair to another table. The couple that came in 10 minutes after us (behind us) was waited on starting with the beverages and then the order.  After being there 20 minutes we quietly got up and left. We were not missed.Service was Below Stsndard and I will share this information. Too bad I have to give a star.,2.64,2.17,2.344,1.7640000000000002,2.358
187,Lin G.,Cherry Hill  NJ,0,3,,2017-05-30,1.0,Terrible service. Very limited gluten-free...unreliable protocol for cross-contamination. We were given food with no utensils. Stopped waiters going by to ask. Asked for manager twice. Finally got forks  with one knapin used. Manager finally brought knives. Food got cold. I took a chance on a supposedly gf quinoa dish. Didn't feel well afterwards. Two family members ordered jambalaya  and one was too salty to eat. I was visiting CA from NJ. I must seek out places that do gf well  and go to places that have gf options on menu. Manager comped the meal due to terrible service  but I'm never going back there. One waiter we asked for silverware walked off and promptly started horsing around inappropriately (groping!) with a female waitress  in clear view  in addition to ignoring our need for flatware.,2.48,2.16,2.344,1.7960000000000003,2.2880000000000003

293,Janice R.,Pacifica  CA,0,4,,2017-05-31,1.0,Bj's really needs to hire more competent people ! With better personalities .. the young short Filipino hostess has absolutely no emotion when greeted  and as far as the young clean cut short Hispanic waiter   VERY unprofessional to show favoritism to customers walking in and not paying any attention to others sitting or greeting others in the same manner . But then again it is only BJ's.. You get 1star only because you have to in order to continue. I made a reservation specifically for 10 people with 2 high chairs for my daughters graduation we were told that it would possibly be 2side by side booths or tables which we were ok with  and when we got there they took us to the back and we had what looked like a table for 4 with a smaller table next to it  not even the same size . It looked tacky and all the hostess stated was   that's all the tables we had left ! WTF?? Completely unacceptable!! Luckily we had 2 tables in the bar area while we were waiting for this reserved table .. This completely ruined my daughters celebration and hope for all of us to sit together as a family . The older gentleman we had as our server looked a lil over whelmed  but was very nice ( thank you )and again   thank you BJ's for for ruining what was supposed to be a preplanned good afternoon .,2.28,2.17,2.316,1.8280000000000003,2.214
117,Daniel G.,Suisun City  CA,0,4,1.0,2017-06-03,1.0,I used to like coming to BJ's  the food was great and the beer selection was one of the better ones that micro brewery's had to offer. This BJ's is one of the worst I've been too...I'm not sure if they got different cooks or the cooks there just suck all together because the food is mediocre at best...calamari is always way over fried  the service is terrible and I'm pretty sure my burger moo'd at me when it was brought out...the beer is still good but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here and have a drink....the only thing that would get me to come back is if they offered what their name suggests if you know what I mean,2.28,2.15,2.312,1.8280000000000003,2.202
155,Oog B.,Pacifica  CA,0,76,,2017-06-06,2.0,Two stars mostly for the food  because it's not bad. But the cleanliness and services not good at all! I'm finally getting around to writing this  since I plan to every time I've been here. As usual  there's a weird dead smell upon entering  and lack of communication from the host makes things confusing. She said to wait  that someone was coming to seat us  so we did. Finally host and server speak and look around  I assume to decide who to seat first  although no one else was waiting. No smiles from anyone at all  so weird. Even as we were seated there was only a blank stare and monotone speaking. Employees here are like zombies. After repeating my order three times and having the server repeat it back incorrectly every time  I was ready to give up. It wasn't difficult  a salad with added chicken. I wasn't really in the mood to have such a difficult and weird nachos experience. I'll cross the street to Jacks next time.,2.28,2.15,2.3,1.9280000000000002,2.202
53,Hector B.,Littleton  CO,53,173,13.0,2017-06-06,4.0,The best part of BJ's is their salads! There kale and brussel sprouts are amazing  add grilled chicken and it's only 660 calories. You will be full and really enjoy it. Their seasonal beers are best! Great place to go without spending a ton! I go at least once a month with my wife!,2.4,2.18,2.296,2.192,2.2680000000000002
52,Mike O.,Daly City  CA,22,115,43.0,2017-06-07,3.0,I used to come to BJ's for lunch quite often when I worked down on Sneath Lane.They have quite a good and filling deals for around 9-12 bucks. The menu changes up every so often.At lunch time there usually is no wait to be seated  but if you have a huge party you may want to call in ahead of time.My favorite deal for lunch is the unlimited soup and salad. I would usually order the Caesar salad and like 3 rounds of clam chowder. There was one time they ran out of clam chowder and we had to sit and wait for 30mins just so they could make a new batch. The other issue is that even if they have it ready  the waiter takes almost 15mins to bring another bowl of soup after the first round.The overall taste is fine  but there's just a lot of waiting to get your food.I do occasionally stop by with my friends for dinner as well. They have pretty good deals for Happy Hour; I think 50% off select appetizers  and cheap drinks. Again  it's pretty hard to flag someone down to put in your orders and then again to pay your bill.In conclusion  food is not bad  but they need a bit of work on service.Warriors game nights can be fun here!,2.4,2.2,2.3,2.0280000000000005,2.2800000000000002
86,Charles R.,San Francisco  CA,1,7,1.0,2017-06-11,2.0,I have been wanting to do a review of this restaurant for quite some time now and even though it's been over a year since we last visited this place  here are my 2 reviews of both times my girlfriend and I went.1) This was from our November 12  2015 visit: On this day  I met my new future girlfriend for a 2nd date. Even though it was late at night  we felt unwelcomed there. Believe me when I say that this restaurant needs new management. Service was extremely slow. Sometimes  the servers don't show up for about 10-15 minutes and you're just sitting there waiting. Yet  we were sitting at a table that made us visible to everyone. After we ordered  our food came out warm  not hot. We only ordered appetizers. The tv's are great  but the atmosphere is very bland. I also noticed too that the wait staff tend to hang around with one another  ignoring customers. I actually saw one employee texting. There was no evidence of management around to delegate authority  so the staff do what they please. It would be a great place to go to  if there was a manager there that would be more strict with the staff. 2) On March 12th  2016  my girlfriend and I went there again (last time was our 2nd date in November  2015 (see above))  and it was the same story as before. When we walked in I approached the hostess counter and gave my name and for 2 people. She said it would be about a 15 minute wait. Well  after waiting at least 45 minutes  I went up to the hostess counter and asked them how much longer for a table (there were 3 tables open). When the hostess asked me who I was  I told her and for 2 people. She apologized as she said to me that they thought I was a party of 4. The other hostess couldn't distinguish between 2 and 4. I made it clear that we were a party of 2 and she put 4. Next  after finally getting to the table  we ordered drinks and ordered the Fried Calamari  Fish & Chips and the Deep Dish Baked Ziti. When we got our food  it was lousy. Really poor quality. The fried calamari was cold (we returned it and the 2nd order wasn't better)  the fish and chips were so  so greasy  you can actually see the oil they deep fried it in shine off the fish and fries. And you can actually see the oil drip off into the wax paper. The Deep Dish Baked Ziti wasn't any better. I spoke with the Manager  and he agreed to remove the Calamari and I also told him about our past experience. Now this manager was from Texas. Why would you bring in a manager from Texas. Was this location so bad that they had to bring him in? Well  even with him there  it still was the same. The only good thing was our waitress. She was very nice  professional and polite. Overall  after our past and present experiences  I give that restaurant a Grade Rating D-. The only reason as to why it is not a Grade rating F (Failure) was because of the drinks and the waitress. As of today  we have not been back to that restaurant and I don't feel that we will be going back there anytime soon. It's just not worth it. I'm sorry  but that restaurant needs a major overhaul.,2.28,2.21,2.3,1.9920000000000002,2.238

103,Natalie C.,San Francisco  CA,0,17,5.0,2017-06-18,3.0,Oh BJ's. You are one hot mess. My boyfriend and sat on the patio today to enjoy the weather. We witnessed 2 hours of wrong orders  dirty glasses  waiters who didn't know the menu  and all sorts of shenanigans that had us just laughing by the end at the circus that was the staff. This was a repeat performance of the other time we've been here. Upside?

Still waiting for the main entrees. It's fathers day and i understand that wait will be long however  Our server is this old man who took 10-15 to greet us  came and said he'll be back. 7 mins later  where's he at? Had to ask the front for our server. Food abnormally taking forever. Ive eaten here plenty of times and wait time between apps and entrees are never this long  esp on a holiday. Currently  looking around and the other tables have the same issue as us  looking around for our food and server... just checked the time  and its been an hour and we dont have our main entrees out yet...,2.2,2.23,2.288,2.024,2.2180000000000004

Meanwhile we looked at the menu decided what we were going to order and yet no server. Once he arrived (15 minutes after being seated) we orders our drinks and right away we order appetizers and our meals. After our order was placed we waited 10 additional minutes for our drinks. We got our soup (which was cold) before appetizers. Once our appetizers arrived we got our main course about 15 minutes later. We had asked our waiter for refills and he forgot! He laughed and walked away. Didn\'t bring our drinks. When we saw him again we asked once again for our refills which he replied ""oh yeah right"".

27,Blyss L.,The Strip  Las Vegas  NV,0,15,19.0,2017-06-29,3.0,Hit and miss. It can be really great and consistent and then you'll hit a few waiters or nights in the kitchen where you're like what the heck is this (which I know happens  and that's fine) but on two occasions now the waiter/waitress have done less than impress me to make it right. 1) broccoli and cheddar bread bowl. Instead of coming out to tell me there isn't enough soup I waited until my bfs burger was delivered and beyond with repeated check ins with my waiter. When my crusty half full bowl of soup arrived it arrived without the bread bowl. When I inquired about this I was then brought out a bread bowl on the side...even though my crusty cup of soup was cold and basically done. I was still charged though...I let it slide. 2)tonight  I came in to Mary dianna as my server. I'm writing this complaint with a compliment oriented goal because she knocked my socks off right off the bat. She delivered perfect service from polite greetings  suggestions  service of refills  attitude and personality anddd listening!!!! I asked for the brussel sprout appetizer with extra sauce but not on the side ideally because it's cold and would taste so much better hot. Her and the cooks delivered! Omg! Soooo yummy 10 stars. And perhaps Mary Diana and the cooks set the standards too high but when she had to go on lunch break and I attempted to tell it to my new server the results were less than satisfactory. 1- it came out without the extra sauce..honestly less sauce than normal (I come here way too much for this dish) and huge half cuts of dry sprouts that they would normally cut again. 2-after requesting for extra sauce and explaining that I don't like the cold sauce it comes out with the cold sauce on top. 3-after again explaining my poor dish goes in again 1 more time and returns drowned in oil and less sauce than I had to friggen start with. 4-with the look and expression of disappointment to my server about my oily sprouts in the end nothing was done to fix it. I wasn't even asked if I wanted a box for my oily sprouts to take home. (Server number 8)It doesn't take much to make things right but for $7 I'll think twice about coming here again for the 2nd time in a week with my boyfriend because I don't want bad service. I missed you Mary Diana after you left. You're a rock star and I hope to see you in the future if we decide to return.,2.12,2.25,2.272,2.2199999999999998,2.1980000000000004
95,Allison Y.,San Mateo  CA,1,233,,2017-06-30,2.0,If this bar/restaurant wishes to get beyond a 2 1/2 * rating overall then they ought to take seriously the complaints & actually do something about the problems. But apparently nothing changes to improve.Why on a weekday with a number of servers walking the floor were patrons forced to wait 20-25 minutes to be seated? Especially when there were empty booths to one side & later on they accommodated others. Even the 'hostess' was unfriendly & indifferent. But overall our server was all right. It's just that the timing of our orders were just questionable: Appetizer arrived with the main  drinks took forever to reclaim from the bar  and dessert was even tardy. Of course  our server apologized profusely for the delays  but this should not even occur. The food was okay nothing outstanding. The fried calamari looked great  but it was disappointing that the batter was not crispy. And the presentation of some of the meals was just not appealing. For instance  the fish and chips was plated in a metal tray. Others were plated on wares. I just do not get the metal tray choice as it looks terrible like if it's a huge TV dinner container or something an institution would provide its inhabitants; it certainly does not belong in a restaurant.At least the cocktails were pleasant.All in all this revisit was just all right. We would not purposely dine here again unless as in this instance it's for convenience.,2.16,2.26,2.276,2.056,2.2199999999999998
148,Steve N.,Fremont  CA,0,11,4.0,2017-07-01,1.0,"This BJ\'s has no understanding of the cooking term ""blackened"". I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos. First  I was brought plain shrimp tacos. Luke warm shrimp with no spice whatsoever. Not blackened. I returned it and in about 5 minutes they brought my order back with the exact same shrimp  now cold  with a little cajun spice sprinkled on top. Still not blackened. Server agreed it wasn\'t right and offered to refire. I asked that he send the manager over. She apologized  said it would be free and offered dessert for the people eating with me since they\'d be finished by the time I got my food. (Table got a tasty pazookie and a scoop of ice cream.) 20 minutes later  I got shrimp cooked without seasoning and then rolled in way too much seasoning. Very salty. Still not blackened. Everyone else was done and I gave up. Another 10 minutes or so to get a manager over (different than first). She apologized and offered me something else to eat  but by this time everyone was ready to leave. She asked what she could do for me and suggested perhaps a gift card. She sent me away with a $25 gift card  but I\'m not particularly anxious to come back  especially after this experience (and seeing their 2.5 star rating here.)Tip to BJ\'s: Rather than just compensating an unhappy customer  alert the kitchen that\'s about to refire a poorly prepared meal to put a rush on it and to make sure it\'s what it\'s supposed to be. Also  have your chefs see foodnetwork.com/terms/blIn addition to the above  my wife\'s bison burger was not cooked rare as requested. We told the waiter to let the kitchen know  but that we didn\'t want to return it since she was particularly hungry. Tasted charred  but was edible.",2.04,2.26,2.276,1.924,2.1719999999999997

My pizza needed a few more minutes in the oven  I wish the pizza was a hot as the pan it came in was . A runner brought it to the table so I think it was sitting out for a bit.

39,Roman T.,South San Francisco  CA,0,7,1.0,2017-07-05,1.0,A training on how not to treat a customer is how wetreated by our server. When we left the restaurant  even tho I wanted to just brush off the terrible service  I felt we were rudely served from beginning to end by this lady server that I felt the need to call the restaurant to speak to a Manager. I recounted to the Manager (Rachel) how we were not given utensils when our order came and when we brought it to her attention  there was no apology and gave us two sets when there was three of us. No offer for condiments was made altho one order was hamburger w unlimited fries. No refills for fries was offered during the meal. We of course  startednoticing this inconsistencies including refill for the drink which she never made until I asked for the bill. After sharing this with the Manager and she apologized and said this would help them in their personnel training. Not worth coming back here.,2.16,2.27,2.264,1.8280000000000003,2.2260000000000004

107,Retired Reefer A.,Daly City  CA,68,55,4.0,2017-07-09,5.0,my family and i decided to give this place another shot after personally speaking to the manager Eugene Ochoa over the phone. i described everything that happened on the night we had our terrible experience and he was very receptive to hearing all the criticism i had  where they fell short and personal recommendations on how they could do better. overall the conversation was positive and left me optimistic for our next visit to BJ's.The next visit we took advantage of their online reservation system to ensure we wouldnt have to wait as long in the event that the place was busy. upon arrival we were seated within 5 mins with maybe about 4 parties already waiting. my biggest gripe on the last visit was that we were unquoted on the waittime and ended up getting passed up by other parties that had reserved online. had i known about this service i wouldve reserved online.ordered our food and drinks  both of which came out in in a reasonble amount of time. food was good and overall experience was similar to the positive ones we've had here so i chalk up the last experience of one that was a flyer. it was a busy night. there were some mistakes made that ruined our experience. i applaud the management for actually reading these reviews and making attempts to try to improve based on real customer feedback. thank you eugene,2.32,2.33,2.28,2.356,2.326
78,Rich K.,Mountain View  CA,34,42,23.0,2017-07-09,1.0,Got there around 10pm sat.

8,Chandra D.,Redwood City  CA,56,421,492.0,2017-07-11,3.0,Dude. I haven't been to BJ's restaurant in years. When I was younger  my youth group and I used to frequent this place after many church events. It was always open late  affordable  and had a variety of entres to appease many tastes.After my husband and I watched Hamilton in San Francisco  we took a Lyft back to the San Bruno BART station where husband's car was parked. It was close to midnight  we were hungry  and the only thing that was open was BJ's. BJ's closes at 1 AM! We were hesitant to go to BJ's because we hadn't been in forever  but since it was open we decide to give it a try.Okay  the food is not that great and there is nothing to write home about. However  if you've just gotten out of a movie at Tanforan  or you're in need of a late night meal  BJ's has got you covered.We started off with spinach artichoke dip  but my husband and I wished we would have skipped the appetizer and had dessert instead.The shrimp tacos I ordered were mediocre at best  and I kind of wished I would have opted to order a pizza. I ordered French fries  and those weren't that good either. Our waiter was a little spacey  but he was trying to manage multiple tables after midnight  so I gave him a pass. He forgot my fries  and it took him awhile to notice. He also forgot to refill our water glasses.Sadly  I was too full to order a pizookie. That's what I wish I would have ordered.Honestly  this place is a two-star joint  but I gave it three stars because it stays open so late. If you enjoy late nights  like a sports bar feel  and don't care too much about the quality of food  BJ's is a good late-night option.,2.16,2.35,2.284,2.1239999999999997,2.2740000000000005

Once silverware got to us  had to give back 3 times because of food residue harden on forks and knives. Salad was great but pasta severely undercooked. Management was excellent on handling mishaps but their in need of professional kitchen help...hope they get it.,2.04,2.36,2.288,2.056,2.232
28,Christopher Y.,Burlingame  CA,102,205,141.0,2017-07-16,3.0,BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse was where I celebrated my birthdays as a young kid. I loved the warm calamari  the crusty pizza  the tasty pasta  and the gorgeous pizookie (Pizza/Cookie/Ice Cream). However  when I began to grow up more  my taste buds craved to explore other cuisines rather than the regular traditional American-style cooking. When those other cuisines became more regular in my diet  my craving for American food bursted  and I brought my attention back to my home  BJ's. I felt relived when I tried their flavorful appetizers  especially my favorite  their calamari. However  I genuinely felt disappointed with the pizza because I have tried many other great pizzas  so I knew what was sightly overcooked-- our pizza was a bit burnt. Overall the food was decent  although it was a lively experience for me. The building was pretty dark and lit nicely. There was enough room to walk by to get to the restrooms too. Waiters can also be nice but sometimes they ignore you. Last time I came  we were told to ask our designated waiter because nowadays some people do not want to get their hands dirty for another waiter if they are not being paid tips by that table. Ultimately  I still like this restaurant and would recommend it for other visitors. There are good times and bad times  but my childhood turns that around. There are nice televisions to look at for sports so it does not get entirely boring if you feel awkward in a conversation. In the future  I hope they can train their waiters better as well as improve their outside eating area. Thank you for a nice visit BJ's.,2.12,2.38,2.284,2.1559999999999997,2.276
5,Diana C.,San Francisco  CA,259,169,374.0,2017-07-18,3.0,A little overpriced but for BOGO  sure why not? Definitely a sports bar feel with tv screens overhead and broadcasting basketball games. We sat near the bar which also was near the outside patio if you wish to sit by a fire pit. The menu is extensive and makes one scratch its head on deciding what to get. We settled on pizza and pasta and got the chicken fettuccine alfredo and a small pizza that we did half/half for toppings - 1/2 Great White and 1/2 Gourmet Five Meat. I didn't realize they were deep dish pizza. I have to say that the Great White was my favorite because I love alfredo sauce. The pasta was good too but pretty simple dish. I downloaded their app and was able to score a free mini Pizookie and got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. If you show your waiter your app code  you can get points for your meal and you can also pay through mobile. I wasn't sure if he was coming back with a paper receipt so I just ended up paying on the app. I would probably come back for some pizookie or bar bites/beer for a game or if there's a BOGO happening. That's about it.,2.2,2.4,2.292,2.1239999999999997,2.3200000000000003

140,Edward K.,Pacifica  CA,0,6,,2017-07-23,1.0,This was once one of my favorite brew pubs but lately it just seems to get worse with each visit. I brought my family here for lunch yesterday. It wasn't crowded and we were seated after a 15 minute wait. But it was all downhill from there. The waitress got part of our order wrong  we had to ask for utensils and napkins  the order came out staggered  with the final item arriving an hour after we were seated. Again  it was not crowded  there were open tables everywhere. Just a terrible experience  yet again. There was a time I would have rated BJ's five stars but that time seems like a distant past. I simply cannot recommend this place.,2.16,2.37,2.272,1.924,2.2860000000000005
24,Bono B.,San Francisco  CA,6,116,5.0,2017-07-24,4.0,Terrific service headed up by Efrom and the other attentive waitstaff along with decent food from the kitchen made an impromptu Sunday night out very enjoyable. I'd say the food is a solid 3.5 based on what we ate  and the great service adds another 0.5 star to the entire dining experience. I normally don't go to chain restaurants (nor give 4 star reviews frequently)  but given our situation and choice  it turned out to be a great option.The Brewhouse Blonde Asparagus was nicely fried  with a nice  light crispy batter and a dusting of parmesan cheese on top. The creamy  garlicky and slightly tart aioli that came with the dish was a great foil to the appetizer. As with the fries  the frying on the asparagus was executed well  with no greasiness.The seasonal salad offering of watermelon  pickled red onions  crisp spring salad mix  and feta cheese crumbled on top was a nice  refreshing summer salad. The vinaigrette dressing was nice and tart  and worked well with the sweet flesh of the diced watermelon. The picked onions may have been a tad too salty  tart  and portioned too generously relative to the greens  but all in all  pretty good salad that I'd like to try replicating at home.BJ's Brewhouse Burger was surprisingly tasty. Maybe not as good as my fave burger from NOPA  but the patty was flavorful  the lettuce  onions  tomatoes  and pickles were fresh and were a good match-up for the burger  and the parmesan crusted bun gave the burger a nice  buttery richness. Not exactly like a brioche bun  but in the similar ball-park texture wise. I didn't need to add ketchup or mustard to the burger - it was seasoned very nicely as-is. I would say it's up there with Super Duper and In-and-Out in terms of quality. And I mean this as a compliment without any irony. Those places make a terrific burger  and BJ's burger can go toe-to-toe with them. The accompanying fries were nice and crispy  just as they should be.The Shrimp & Asparagus Penne was the least favorite dish of the evening. I'd have to say the kitchen kind of killed the pasta - it was over al dente  nearly mushy in texture. I wasn't too thrilled with the marinara either. It was much sweeter than I'd prefer - it was almost like they'd put in too much tomato paste in the marinara. They may have been better off just making a simple tomato sauce with olive oil  thinly sliced garlic  black pepper  and sea salt  and sauteeing the shrimp and asparagus very quickly in the end in the sauce.In general  I think the simpler dishes fared well whereas the pasta dish that required more components didn't do so well. Perhaps something to think about as you navigate their menu and order your meal.,2.24,2.4,2.268,2.352,2.3360000000000003
121,Ruby R.,Daly City  CA,0,1,,2017-07-27,2.0,We came on a Thursday evening  the place was a little crowded but we found a space in the bar. The food came out fairly quickly but the service was mediocre. Nerves got plates for our appetizers and our silverware came halfway thru our appetizer. I'm the end we orders a mini churro pazooki  and the churros were not dusted with cinnamon sugar. How am I suppose to eat a churro without cinnamon sugar. That's what I get for giving chain restaurants a chance.,2.16,2.41,2.272,2.056,2.3100000000000005

First our appetizer was burnt to the extent that it has a bitter after taste. Told the server that this is not what I expected since I've ordered this in the past. He said Brussels sprouts are suppose to be bitter. I partially agree to it but a bitter after taste tho? Plus you can literally see burnt pieces?? Uhhmmm maybe not. Second was our main course... it took 42mins for it to be served. I was staring at our server since The table next to us arrived after us but got their meal first mind you we had similar orders except for my deep dish ziti which all came out warm and not hot. Fries were missing. You can tell our dish has been sitting out for a while. And to top this wonderful experience of we were still on our tables getting ready to leave he took the check book to check if we left a tip.

62,Candy W.,San Francisco  CA,2,25,9.0,2017-08-11,1.0,"BJ\'s is one of those places we go to when we realize  ""Oh let\'s go since we haven\'t been there in awhile"". We arrived around 5:30ish PM on a Friday and it was a 20 min wait before we got the text notification that there\'s a table ready for us. I looked around the restaurant and it wasn\'t all that busy  despite the fact that it\'s around dinner time. Our waiter (from what was stated on our bill) was ""Jimmy A"". A tall gentleman with a man-bun and a tattoo on his neck. It took awhile for him to take our orders  which was fine since I saw him talking to a party of 4  two tables down  across from us. For drinks  I had ordered the refillable strawberry lemonade. I finished it fairly quick since the cup was full of ice. He hadn\'t offer me any refills until my boyfriend asked. The calamari we ordered tasted old  cold  soggy  and the batter was falling off. We had to use our hands since we didn\'t have utensils on the table. I didn\'t get the chance to catch his name but a different waiter (tall  slim  African American) had brought out our entrees and he was so apologetic  I wanted to give Jimmy A\'s tips to him instead. Not once were we checked up on  but I\'ve seen him with the same table of 4 across from us  at LEAST 5 times. What\'s up with that?My boyfriend insisted on not leaving a tip  but I still left 15% because I work in the food service industry as well. I would get it if maybe he was having a bad day but the service was so terribly poor  I didn\'t care enough to put that into consideration anymore. The least you could do is say ""thank you"" when we give you the check/tips.",2.24,2.37,2.276,1.8920000000000003,2.3180000000000005

I also ordered a Caeser salad with extra croutons and dressing. Come with neither. Had to ask for the croutons and dressing 2 times and they made it feel like I was bothering them and it was my fault. Looks like BJ's is going the way of Elephant Bar that was at Serramonte.

11,Anita L.,Union City  CA,315,528,338.0,2017-08-18,3.0,"The roasted shrimp peruvian quinoa bowl was surprisingly good and (supposedly) pretty healthy for you too. It was a win in my book. They also have a decent beer selection here. However  there are never any new offerings so the selection becomes a little stale. Being a ""brewery""  I would advise corporate management to really look at introducing more variations of beer. The San Bruno location is always packed whenever I come and the wait is usually quoted at being close to an hour for two people. It\'s a 50% chance of being able to nab a seat in the bar area.",2.32,2.4,2.256,2.1239999999999997,2.368
37,Stephanie A.,Millbrae  CA,0,5,1.0,2017-08-20,3.0,Three stars for the food and ambience (let's face it  half the menu is frozen). But 5 stars goes to our waitress Asia.

15,Joshua M.,Daly City  CA,142,370,1379.0,2017-08-21,2.0,I've been to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse at Tanforan a twice to celebrate certain events. My first visit here  everything was decent in that the food wasn't all too bad nor that great. It was simple American food to make for a good casual dinner in a setting that is nice for conversation. I did really enjoy one of their desserts though which was like a giant cookie with ice cream on top.However  upon my second visit here  I ordered a potato dish that I just couldn't eat. I think they did a poor job cleaning their dishes because the potato had the smell and taste of washing detergent which really deterred me from coming back.,2.28,2.43,2.24,2.024,2.37
33,E F.,San Francisco  CA,2,118,,2017-08-24,4.0,Let's be honest - all the dishes are predictable American classics  but the execution is pretty darn good for a chain. Friendly efficient staff. Cool for hanging in the sports bar also cool for families in the restaurant. Much to like here.,2.32,2.43,2.24,2.192,2.386
9,Alan F.,Hercules  CA,59,371,62.0,2017-08-24,3.0,A sort of faux-brewpub in the Tanforan shopping center; in spite of a show of brew tanks inside and out  the physical beer production for this location is actually carried out at BJ's Roseville facility.Big open dining room  open to but distinct from the bar area. Menu is casual dining  roughly on the level of Chili's or TGI Friday's. There's often a wait for seating at peak hours  and sometimes slow service. We've come here more often for snacks while shopping than for full meals. We keep returning to two of their appetizers  the spinach and artichoke dip and the mozzarella sticks.Seven full-time house beers on tap  plus two rotating taps and at least one guest tap. On a recent visit  I went for the ones that were new to me:- Light Switch Handcrafted Light Beer. Clear gold  light head. Virtually no nose. Light-bodied malt  low bitter hopping; about as much character as  oh  Miller Lite--which I'm sure is exactly the effect they were going for. A training-wheels craft beer for customers who'd just as soon not be trained.- Nitwit Belgian-Style Witbier. 4.7%  9 IBU. Cloudy yellow  light head. Weak orange nose  but the taste is much bolder  with banana ester and yeast notes. Also a spice note; the menu copy describes it as coriander  but it tasted more like allspice to me.- From the guest tap  Belching Beaver Nitro Peanut Butter Milk Stout. 5.3%. I had encountered this in its bottled version in San Diego earlier this year  but it was my first time for the draft rendition. Dark brown  medium cream head. Chocolate and estery nose. The taste has a definite peanut butter and chocolate presence  sort of a liquid Nutella; also a bit of peanut husk in the finish. Smooth nitrogen mouthfeel.,2.36,2.43,2.244,2.0280000000000005,2.402
91,Franko F.,Daly City  CA,0,3,,2017-08-25,1.0,Hello I came to this restaurant but it is bad service I sat in the patio to order a beer wait 44 minutes with no costumers.. and no one approached I went to order at the bar and pay at the bar.

4,Teena N.,San Francisco  CA,35,235,1076.0,2017-08-26,3.0,Second time here  first time dining in. +Spinach Artichoke dip was delicious !! Creamy goodness.+The girl waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. She made sure to check on us at the right time and was very informative. -Deep dish pizza was alright  made with fresh ingredients  but seems like a regular pizza more than a deep dish.-Clam chowder was okay  creamy not too flavorful. Added pepper  still felt like it was missing something.+Poozookie  salted caramel was delicious  next time I order it  I would ask them to ease up a bit on the caramel. Overrall  the waitress  appetizer and dessert was what stood out to me. Definitely coming back for the spinach dip.Enjoy!,2.28,2.41,2.232,1.9640000000000002,2.358
45,cynthia K.,Burlingame  CA,0,16,1.0,2017-08-28,1.0,I've eaten at this restaurant a few times and service was always really bad  today I decided to give it another chance as it's close to my work  went to the bar area  no one paid attention no menu so I went to the bar  bartender didn't pay attention either  I saw a server looking at my direction but decided not to pay attention either  I'm almost running out of my lunch time so I decided to leave infuriated  so people  go somewhere else as these people at this establishment doesn't seem to care about customers who walks to their door  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME EATUNG OR DRINKING AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!,2.28,2.41,2.22,1.7000000000000002,2.358
43,Bruce B.,Armona  CA,0,23,5.0,2017-08-28,1.0,Horrible. Small tables  lousy service. The waiter was slow. I had to ask for a refill of my Pepsi. Both glasses were watery. I asked if my lunch was ready when he brought my refill. He brought it out. It could have been good. Portion size was small. Food was cold. I have eaten at BJ's in Sacramento. That was a superb restaurant. This one was poor. I am sad I wasted my appetite on this place when I had so many choices. I did not think it was real busy but it tool a half hour for a refill and over an hour for 2 tacos.After receiving the response from general manager ochoa  I read through other reviews. Sad to say  many other people had similar results at this BJ's. I see that Mr ochoa likes to give a form letter response to bad reviews. Not very professional or caring.  He acted much like his employees. Hmmm.,2.28,2.38,2.216,1.7640000000000002,2.34
26,Kira S.,Oakdale  CA,134,11,2.0,2017-08-29,5.0,Its a great place to go for a quick bite or for a family outting! Everything is served right  and when it isn't  someone always smoothes it over. Everything on the menu I've had so far has been pretty good. I really enjoy that they have lighter options.,2.44,2.41,2.224,,2.422
18,Raina S.,El Granada  CA,383,565,342.0,2017-08-29,1.0,"Wow  the food here is just awful. It fuels my theory that  the bigger the menu  the harder it is to make anything very well.Service was a bit odd. Our first server walked up to our table and just stood there. No  ""Hi  my name is..."" nothing. Her shift ended after she took our order and another person took over. He was a bit of an improvement. My husband had a burger. He didn\'t like it  but ate some. My daughter got a French Dip. The meat was cold. I asked her if she wanted something else  but she opted to got with no food over bad food. I ordered the cauliflower tacos. I don\'t see this often on menus but when they are done well they\'re delicious. No surprise  here  BJ\'s doesn\'t do veggie tacos well. Very little flavor  and the veggies were past their prime.Their beer is decent  hence the star. I got a blond ale. The flavor was better than I\'d expected. I wish I\'d just stuck to beer for lunch.When our new server came to clear the plates  there was no mention of ""Wow  you guys didn\'t eat much. Was everything okay?"" I\'m thinking he already knew the answer and just doesn\'t bother to ask anymore.",2.32,2.41,2.208,,2.374
25,Jaine L.,San Francisco  CA,45,28,,2017-08-30,1.0,About a month ago my friend was having a drink and a rat ran up her pant leg!!! Why is this place still in business!! Shes not the type to write a bad review or any reviews for that matter so I took upon myself to inform people that go to BJ's at tanforan that this place is probably infested with rodents. All management did was to offer us a discount ! Haa... what a joke!!! Not sure why this place still gets some 4 stars reviews...but overall there must be a reason why this place has 2 and only stars!!,2.28,2.38,2.196,,2.34
3,Danielle S.,Pacifica  CA,246,33,50.0,2017-08-31,4.0,Did you know that BJ's has a ton of promotions now including 50% off large pizzas and $5 margaritas on Mondays?? No? Well  now you know!! I'm not too sure when they started these weekly promotions  but on Tuesdays they have discounted pizzookies. I believe there are a few more but they didn't catch my eye -- so be sure to check their website to double check what the other deals are. I came here on a Monday night and the wait was ten minutes. We ordered a large great white (deep dish pizza topped with alfredo  chicken  tomatoes  mushrooms  and garlic) -- each large has ten slices. Between my friend and I  we ate 2-3 pieces each and still had enough to bring home. After the promotional discount and limitless strawberry lemonades  our bill came out to about $22 after tax and tip. Even though it wasn't the most busy Monday night  we didn't get too much attention from our waitress. As stated before I had ordered a strawberry lemonade which has free refills  but I was only able to get one refill because our waitress barely stopped by our table and was pretty hard to find when she wasn't directly in front of our table.Overall  I am extremely satisfied with these new deals BJ's has come out with and I will probably be going a little more often because their great white deep dish is literally the best.,2.24,2.39,2.208,,2.3300000000000005
7,Monica M.,San Francisco  CA,227,80,239.0,2017-09-01,1.0,Let me first off and say thank you to the manager and the server for trying to make a horrible night better . We had an horrible evening here due to the kitchen staff not paying attention to orders . We came into this location after a night of back to school shopping we made a huge mistake . We first started off with drinks then we order appetizer . We ordered chicken wings served with dirty celery (picture to follow) . Then ordered a split pizza that was suppose to be half combo and have buffalo pizza . The kitchen made it barbecue chicken not buffalo . Contacted the server and to make it right she was going to have a new pizza made and it came out barbecue AGAIN ! Not sure what's going on in the back kitchen but we will not be returning ever again . Oh and their floors are so sticky and slippery ! Could have fallen on their dirty floors !,2.08,2.39,2.196,,2.2660000000000005
17,Adrienne B.,San Mateo  CA,7,16,348.0,2017-09-03,5.0,This is a long overdue review. First and foremost  out of all the BJ's restaurants that I've been to  this branch is my favorite. The hosts are very friendly here and always have a smile on their faces when you walk in. I've also never had a problem with any of the servers here. My favorite server is Katrina B.! If you go to this branch  and have her as your server  you will get above and beyond service. If you see something wrong with your dish  she will deeply apologize and immediately have it fixed. If you need extra condiments  she'll get them right away and won't keep you waiting. She always checks up on you to either make sure you're enjoying your meal or to ask you if there's anything she can do to make it better. Top notch service! Thanks Katrina B.!,2.24,2.41,2.204,,2.3420000000000005
19,Amanda C.,Berkeley  CA,273,11,,2017-09-03,1.0,Horrible service  very slow. Waiters need to stop catering so much of their time to big families when there are other couples who need their order taken. If you're gonna have such a big restaurant  please make sure you have enough wait staff to accommodate.,2.24,2.41,2.196,,2.3420000000000005
34,Mercedes R.,Anaheim  CA,15,67,,2017-09-03,1.0,One star is far too generous. Incredibly disappointing as I love BJ's but this location is in need of some work. The server forgot about our food (actually questioned out loud if he even had put the order in)  didn't bother apologizing when he did finally get around to bringing out our appetizer and by then the chips and spinach dip were cold. He disappeared  not bothering to check on us. Then another server came out with a 2nd spinach dip which was supposed to be ours...not sure where our server got the first one. The table sat after us got their food first and when our pizza finally came arrived it was mildly warm like it may have been sitting out. Though the manager was nice when we discussed this with her  I wouldn't return.,2.24,2.38,2.184,,2.324
70,Md G.,San Bruno  CA,0,29,2.0,2017-09-03,2.0,"This is a tip regarding the enlightened cauliflower tacos: Don\'t. I like cauliflower  but it really doesn\'t work as a taco filling in these. The pita was fine as a substitute for the tortilla and the other taco fillings were fine  but the taco-seasoned cauliflower? Nope. Also  this is served with ""seasonal bistro grains"" which turned out to be plain brown rice. Plain. Brown. Rice. There is some good stuff on the menu. Order something else.",2.28,2.36,2.188,,2.328
6,temo g.,Daly City  CA,35,19,3.0,2017-09-04,1.0,I went there with the family for a post movie meal. Huge mistake...I ordered the soup and salad. The salad was just okay with a bottle flavored dressing. The soup  clam chowder was horrible. First off  it was supposed to be a bowl and not a cup so I expected a lot more. It did actually comes in a bowl but was only filled about 25%... I literally put my spoon into it and hit bottom! There was only about half an inch of soup! It was cold and nasty.Wife ordered the shrimp with quinoa. She had about 3 bites and said it was disgusting.The kids shared a brewery pizza. It was soo greasy and disgusting my starving kids didn't even finish a slice each. What hungry kids turn away pizza?! Never!This place used to be good. It just seems to get worse each time...Yuck!,2.12,2.32,2.184,,2.24
38,Lawrence L.,San Francisco  CA,1,46,,2017-09-04,1.0,Been here many times for years... never have been so disappointed.After waiting 1/2 hour for our very simple order of turkey burgers and baked ziti  we finally got served but had to ask and wait another 10 minutes for our silverware and napkins.The waiter asked if we wanted a ice-tea refill  but after another 10 minutes  we decided to just leave and asked for the check. Well  he decided to bring us someone else's check for $130 and ran off. After chasing him down and getting our correct check  we couldn't leave soon enough. Was it busy? partially up front  but where they sat us in the back  it was less than 1/2 full. Were we not served because we were Asian  or some of us were elderly?In addition  the floor leading to our table in the back was extremely slippery... were surprised that no one fell while we were there. Also  the Men's room was disgusting as they obviously had not cleaned it since who knows when. Don't know what has happened to this establishment  but it has gone WAY down recently.,2.12,2.32,2.168,,2.24
66,MaryElise C.,Pacifica  CA,0,1,,2017-09-06,1.0,Very slow service. Had to wait 45 minutes for a glass of wine and then had to track down the server to order our food. The food was barely warm when it was finally served. Not pleased with my experience.,2.12,2.32,2.168,,2.24
57,Patrice B.,Daly City  CA,0,7,3.0,2017-09-08,2.0,Ordered online and our food wasn't ready when promised  which made my son late for work. 30 minutes waiting for food is pushing it when dining in  for pickup  unacceptable. Management needs to be upgraded.,2.16,2.32,2.16,,2.2560000000000002
31,Julia B.,San Mateo  CA,50,8,,2017-09-09,1.0,A while back I went with a friend for happy hour and was very disappointed with the rubbery calamari. we complained to the manager and we started talking in further detail about how long he had been there. And he was telling us that he had just a started there and that he was planning on making a few changes.We were super impressed by his confidence. we gave it another chance and went back a month later and it was so much better. The service was wonderful!.... Last night... ugh! I know it was a Friday but the service sucked! We had called an hour before we arrived to get our name down because we were a larger party  we did and the person that took our name said it would be an hour and half wait. So we took our time getting to the restaurant because of the wait. We get there and we confirm with the hostess to get another estimate because it had been an hour already. the Hostess then told us that it would be 2 hours. We were so frustrated  so then we thought oh maybe there will be a few tables that would be available at the bar area. There wasn't but a few tables looked like they were finishing up so we were diligently watching. I asked the host stand if that manager was here and they said he had moved to a different restaurant... what a shame!! He ran that restaurant very well. This family walks in way after us and a server walks up to them and greets them as family and whispered to them oh yeah there is a table that is about to be getting up... I'll save it for you. I was so pissed at that point because we had already been waiting for an hour. I think the servers name is Jon.I wont be going back there. Terrible service!,2.2,2.31,2.176,,2.2660000000000005

We haven't been here in ages and it did not disappoint.We shared a deep dish pizza and then did the pizookie trio.Food was delicious  our waiter was terrific and was on top of things. This was definitely better than previous experiences. We'll be back.,2.24,2.34,2.184,,2.3
2,Michelle S.,San Francisco  CA,200,143,453.0,2017-09-09,2.0,Yikes.So the venue itself is cool. Nice decor  great vibe. It looks like it's decorated for adults rather than family - which I like. So I was excited.But again  yikes. Food came out super slow. It took so long we almost asked  and we never ask. The server also put our appetizers in as entrees...so our apps came out at the same time as our entrees - which was pretty frustrating.Also  two of our dishes were straight up COLD. Like not kinda cold  like cold. Like my sweet potato fries felt like they'd been sitting out for 30 minutes. I sent them back and the server didn't seem surprised or apologetic. Seemed kind of like the norm...The sweet potato fries were good  my fried calamari was okay. Our garlic knots app was okay...the couscous mac and cheese was okay...everything was okay. I would not recommend this spot. Only if you live in the area and your options are limited. Too bad  seems like it has a lot of potential just misses the mark.,2.2,2.29,2.164,,2.2540000000000004
12,Circadian R.,San Francisco  CA,38,15,1.0,2017-09-09,5.0,The location  service  and food was excellent. I'm a celiac and was scared to order. Food was delicious. I'm posting this 3 days later to say my stomach hasn't hurt and I haven't had any symptoms. They really make sure that cross contamination doesn't happen!,2.36,2.33,2.176,,2.342
22,Blake H.,San Francisco  CA,6,19,11.0,2017-09-10,4.0,The menu is outstanding. I mean it's really impressive how many options they have. In addition to options being good sized portions  most menu items seem to be really tasty. The prices are fair for the portions  but it's not an amazing deal or anything. Definitely a fun place to watch big sports events. For the warriors championships  it's always packed out with a great crowd and great vibe. The ONLY reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars  is because it's not a 5 star restaurant with 5 star service  like a Gary Denko (5x as expensive). BJ's is an excellent 4 star choice.,2.28,2.35,2.192,,2.322

89,Rois L.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,2017-09-11,2.0,It would have been nicer  which is I believe to be part of the customer service to check and ask the potential clients/customers if they needed help when they're standing there  looking so unsure and uneasy. I was standing in front and actually have fallen in line by the take out service area and I agree  I should have looked closely around and read whatever was written but I didn't. But then I patiently stood there until 2 of the people in front of me were done. I still patiently stood while the manager was speaking with one of the staff manning the area. There was another staff on that same spot that wasn't saying anything and was just giving me side glances until I finally deicided to approach to ask if that is were I need to ask for seating. She pointed me to the direction of the one on the right side which clearly I didn't notice. It was btw so close by my right side while I was patiently waiting in line. I've been to other restaurants and bj's brewery restaurant in the Bay Area and the minute I walked in and stood there looking unsure  some staff will always approach to ask if I needed help. The bottom line  poor customer service and considering there were staffs available milling around while I was standing  no one bothered to ask while I try to give each and every one that look of someone needing assistance. It was so uncool and disappointing. I hope this feedback will help the management focus on how to improve their ratings.,2.16,2.33,2.172,,2.2620000000000005
23,Hnin T.,Garden Grove  CA,4,2,,2017-09-11,1.0,Went for lunch on 09/03 mainly for strawberry margarita. After 25 min we got some fries & salad but no drinks. Check with our waiter and said someone from the bar will bring it. It's for him to go & get our drinks. When we got it the frozen margarita is already melted. We told the waiter  he went to get and added more shaved ice. We said it was not the margarita taste. He said he will get us the new one & didn't get at all. Pizza was cold also. Never had that bad experience before. When the bill came they charged for the drinks and we pointed out for the charge for the drinks. Bad.. really bad service.,2.08,2.32,2.168,,2.224

16,Sarah B.,South San Francisco  CA,4,10,11.0,2017-09-13,1.0,I'm someone who's been here multiple times and had never had a problem before. However after one bad experience  it's pretty safe to say that I'll never be back. Long story short  I ordered one of my favorite meals  Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and I ended up with food poisoning hours after. I wasn't mad at the place  I just wish that they would know better and not serve or prepare expired/ bad food to guests. Afterwards  I contacted the establishment online to let them know about my experience and to please try to avoid it from happening in the future. I received no reply or apology whatsoever. Not that I was looking for any kind of sympathy  but if your food gave someone food poisoning  wouldn't you feel bad? Definitely not saying this will happen to everybody  but if you want to order the Clam Chowder after reading this  lol go for it.,2.0,2.24,2.156,,2.144
0,Finau F.,Millbrae  CA,152,38,50.0,2017-09-15,3.0,This is definitely a place you can resort to if court food doesn't cut it for you in the mall! Personally after trying a handful of entrees I only seem to get the two same things each time I come here Parmesan Chicken and the infamous cookies n' cream Pizookie! There's always a long wait but it's nice there's a Barnes&Noble and different shops near to roam around until they text you with your table ready! Customer service could be improved but in such a busy chaotic place that's obviously asking to much of these young waiters/waitresses.,2.08,2.24,2.16,,2.176
