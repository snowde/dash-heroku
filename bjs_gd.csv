Most of the time it is easy to swap a shift or get one picked up if you need a shift covered for whatever reason.,"The managers don't care about their employees. They don't really value team members like they should. There is a lot of favoritism from the managers especially as far as accountability goes. They give you a really hard time if you have to call out for a shift, they don't really care if you're sick or have personal things going on they just want a body to fill the position whether you're in a good position to work or not. I gave this job a two stars overall because I feel like managers can really make or break a job for you. So to have a crappy management team that is unfair to team members and does not value or treat their team members like human beings makes it a little hard to want to work for that place. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because my coworkers is what really makes the job for me. I have really met a handful of great people in my time working for BJs.","Be more fair. Allow your team members to feel heard and valued. No one needs their ego stroked but to only point out things when someone makes a mistake and never use positive reinforcement is not a very good way to go about a manger to team member relationship. You're team members will be more willing to do whatever is asked of them and perform better in their position if they feel as though the management team has some sort of care for them other than just being a body to fill a position. We are all people with lives and things going on outside of work, sometimes it would be nice to be treated like human beings. Also be more honest with employees about their opportunities for advancement. I don't feel as though the managment team is fair or honest about this with team members and as a result a lot of team members feel invalid and end up leaving the company which is why our turnover rate is as high as it is."

It takes forever to complete side work and rolling silverware to leave. The managers have unrealistic expectations for you, working the heck out of you all the time.

They expect you to memorize the entire menu as soon as you start, which is one of the biggest menus ever. Managers never really help out when you need them. And they aren't very understanding at all. They definitely show favoritism. You have to follow a script when talking to your customers and it's extremely annoying not to mention they get very irritated by it most times. The clientele is awful so no matter how good of service I provide customers, I will still get awful tips. The last restaurant I worked at I would always leave with over 20% tips... Here I leave with around 10%. BJ's doesn't add gratuity to huge parties so even if you have a group of 20+ people, you could possibly get nothing out of serving the table. Not to mention tip out is awful, absolutely awful!! You have to tip out to food runners, bussers, and the bar. Bussers literally do nothing; it is the servers job to clean everything off the tables and only leave cups. Bussers will even leave a stack of dishes after wiping down a table for us to pick up. Everyone is just really lazy and never helps anyone out, but always asks others to do things for them and help them. Hosts don't know how to seat people, they just fill empty tables whenever they become open. So getting triple sat is a common thing. Also the restaurant is always super hot.",

Team work was the best I've worked with in any restaurant.,"I was trained to inform the guest of calorie changes when a substitution is made on the ""enlightened"" dishes. I did this and accidently insulted this guest who turned out to be a mystery shopper. In turn, she lied on her review (I believe to get back at me thinking I would just get written up or something) and I got fired. Granted, I did not ask, ""Have you made your selections,"" but I did not do that because she already told me she wanted a few minutes to look at the menu. I was also trained to offer the hand crafted rootbeer if we weren't going to offer an alcoholic beverage (this was our judgment based on time of day, etc.) I did this and got points taken off. She said I didn't offer an appetizer or dessert and the plates were still on her table when she was ready to leave. She took two bites of her dish and asked for a box. The plates were taken off when she was done boxing up her food, but I still got points taken off. She kept me at her table for extended periods of time interfering with the quality of service for my other tables. They aren't supposed to interfere with the service. Because this mystery shopper was having a bad day and what I was trained to do was actually wrong, I am now a single mom without a job to support my daughter and have no idea what I am going to do to pay for daycare and rent in a couple of weeks.","Take a closer look at why a mystery shopper may have given a server a low score and don't fire them after one bad shop. In the previous weeks, I had 3 or 4 tables ask to speak to a manager to tell them how great my service was and they would be coming back to ask for me. I wish the managers could have taken this into account. If a table informs me that they would like a few minutes, I am not going to ask, ""Have you made your selections"" because it makes me seem like I'm ignoring them and trying to rush them. The quality of service should not be based on whether or not we ask, ""Have you made your selections"" but rather the experience the guest has while there and how they feel when they leave."

Our store is a family, and while it's super stressful most of the time, we run like a well oiled machine that only comes with time, practice, and relationship. All I've ever had to do is speak up and ask (on occasion, more than once) and doors start opening. There is space and MONEY for team members to cross train, pick up bookkeeping in the office if that's your thing (read: real career, looks-good-on-a-resume, not-""hey-I'm-a-server"" experience) WHILE still making daily money on the floor. Also, if a guest orders soup and salad, you don't have to make it yourself. All ex-olive garden employees are leaping for joy, so I hear.","All of this to prepare you for what is sure to be a wonderful experience should you apply to work at bj's:<br><br>The POSI system is a Micros based software specific to BJ's. If you're coming from an Aloha background, prepare for frustration. And if you're coming from a Micros background, prepare for frustration. Luckily, there are little tricky ways around the most common hang ups (like you can't reprint or send orders after a check has been separated.) Find an experienced server, and ask them their tricks, because when you've got 6 tables one lunch or dinner, you're GOING to need them.<br><br>(Answer: separate an extra ticket with ONLY a ""no bev"" on it, process the payment for that one needy has-to-leave-earlier or do-mine-now-anyway guest, close it out, and recombine. The extra no-bev ticket will prevent you from being locked out if you get down to only one ticket and they now want another drink, and having the option to recombine everything means you don't need a manager for every last order.)<br><br>It is SO HARD to serve at BJ's compared to other restaurants, and sometimes the money doesn't reflect how much extra work it is. Guest orders something with fries? Ketchup not on the table. You have to go get it. Unsweet tea but wants splenda? Sweetener not on the table. You have to go get it. Orders the tortilla soup? Doesn't come with a spoon because of the bowl it's served in. You have to drop it on the table before their soup comes out. These very common items suck up a LOT of time when you're triple sat and need to close out another check, and that guest needs ""more ray-anch.""<br><br>Every server is scheduled weekly for a food running shift. No exceptions. You get tipped out, but you get paid server wage. Most people dread it. It's a LOT of work, but a great food runner makes a much smoother shift. Lazy food runners can make it all crash and burn. Many of us tip out extra, but that would depend on the culture in your restaurant, really.<br><br>White button down shirts. They want us to look like fine dining. But we're not fine dining. We're a sports bar and brewhouse shaped like a restaurant. We used to have black shirts. By the end of the shift with the white shirts, I look like a SLOB. Because of the number of extra trips we have to make at this restaurant, consolidation is key, so when I stack plates from my belly button to my nose to haul them back to dish, I end up with spots of food all over me.. and there's no getting rid of it until I get home. EVERYONE leaves looking like they rolled around on the kitchen floor. Spill tea on yourself? Instand wet t-shirt contest. Girls come in in a non-neutral underclothes color? sent home. (granted, that would be THEIR fault. Sillies.) Any wrinkle? Magnified. This shirt issue is the worst part of my job, I honestly feel. Also, I wear little boy size large because white, button down shirts for women are 20-30 bucks plus. And I refuse to spill food on a shirt that nice shirt. I don't even react when I spill food on my shirt if I'm out on a date anymore. I'm like, ""Oh, look. That again. Well, it's about time, this shirt looked great for an hour.

Also, expect to be doing work well beyond what hostesses at most restaurants do. They refuse to keep enough staff working to make the restaurant run smoothly, so in order to pick up the slack we are made to clean the bathrooms, clear off tables, and wash silverware on top of seating people.

People were hired on looks rather than actual ability.,"Make sure servers tip down, especially those that are incompetent and have their work done by other employers such as drivers."

"""Great job while going to school.""",4.0," Feb 19, 2009",Current,Server,"Vacaville, CA",Yes,Neutral,Neutral,Part-time,,"It is one of the busiest restaurants in the area. Since I am a server, this is helpful because I am able to go home with a good amount of money in tips after my shifts. The shifts are fairly short compared to other jobs earning the same amount of money. I do not think I have ever worked a full eight hour shift as a server once. I can clock in and be out in five hours and make twice as much as someone working eight hours at a job paying double the minimum wage. Plus...I work with a lot of beautiful girls.","The hours can get somewhat annoying. The day shifts usually start around eleven am. This is not very early, and it is also not late enough to get much done before a shift. By the time you get off, the day is over and just have the night to look forward to. The night shifts get annoying because they start around four pm. Again, the timing of the shifts stops me from making plans during the day. It seems as though I am sitting around waiting for my shift. I am really picky about the timing because I am a full time student and free time is scarce to me...Hence the complaining about not being able to do things on days I am scheduled to work.","The servers are able to keep their composure in front of a table no matter what is going on, there is no reason management cannot do this while managing."
"""BJ's Restaurants, a great place to begin or refine your restaurant experience.""",5.0," Jun 19, 2008",Past,Server,"Fresno, CA",Yes,Neutral,Yes,Full-time,More than 5 years,"A great work environment where extroverts thrive. I myself am a very outgoing person with good attention skills, and being able to work at a restaurant that utilizes it was great. The food was great, and typical customers were nice. If you are looking at getting into the restaurant industry, this is a great place to start, with good training and decent advancement opportunities.","Like any restaurant, you take the blunt end of any mistakes, even if they happen in the kitchen. This is typical of any restaurant though, as the server is responsible for the customer. Management was great about taking care of the mistakes, whether it be late or incorrect food. Also, getting time off sometimes depended on someone else covering your shift, which meant you could be stuck working on a day you requested off.","Continue doing what you do! You are a big reason why the company is growing, and supporting your employees and making them happy helps them share that feeling with the customers."
