Management is all over the place, forced to work overtime if your replacement is there on time Angry customers, but you'll get that anywhere No tips, very limited advancement, low pay, irregular hours Long ticket times for food and mistakes in the kitchen Work life balance was low Dealing with the public is not easy. Not many cons, perhaps the only bad thing I've noticed is when they make bad hires that dilute the positive energy of the restaurant Not the best pay p The management doesn't respect the needs and wants of their employees and scheduling is sometimes posted just a day or two before you may have to work. Job can also get extremely stressful and some managers do not handle this well Poor management to work with High quality work is not always noticed and the top dogs don't verbalize their appreciation -- it is just expected for you to work hard and continue working hard. None great place to work Not good if you're looking to make a lot of money long term but enough to get by as a college student some people are not fun to server, the same income is not always the same Servers to not receive benefit share. Huge menu which can be frustrating to try to learn Too based on numbers of secret shoppers no matter what the circumstances, lots of turnover Development is non existent, work life balance strained, don't pay their employees (hourly) competitively vs the industry and benefits for non management are horrid When it's in a slow season you get close to no hours.
