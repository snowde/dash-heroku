Service Assistant," Oct 7, 2015"," Anonymous Interview Candidate in  Chino Hills, CA",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. I interviewed at BJ's Restaurants (Chino Hills, CA) in August 2015.","Arrived slightly before appointed interview time. Waited almost thirty minutes after the appointment time. When it was time for the interview I should have realized I was sent down river and that I wasn't going to get the job. Instead of being interviewed by a manager, I was interviewed by the head of the kitchen.,As we sat at a table in the corner of the restaurant he fumbled through the papers that were probably printed out thirty seconds before he gathered me from waiting in the front. He asked me about my previous employment and what those jobs entailed. I told of recent ones and spoke of ones that were listed on my resume that I attached via their internet application process, but were not listed on their truncated list for their internet application that only allows users to put three previous places that they worked. When I spoke of the one that was on the resume and not their short list a momentary look of bewilderment flashed on his face and he shuffled through the papers again.With that reaction I can only guess that resume does not get seen by those doing the interview and it almost pointless to upload one. I recommend that you bring one to the interview, because they will only have the listing of the jobs you provided on their shortsighted internet application.,After a few more questions about the other jobs that I had held he decided to be more straightforward and told me that I wasn't going to get the job and partly it had to do with not having a food handlers card, which seems more like a deflection because the law requires someone to get one within 30 days of being hired and it costs 10 to 20 dollars to take a class and tests to get a card.,My advice is make sure you are interviewed by a manager, and bring a detailed resume to the interview."," Describe your experience at your other jobs, what you did.   ,Answer Question"

The first interview went well. He asked me basic questions and explained the job better. The second interview was completely different from the first. They lost my application, so I had to answer the same questions as I did from the first interview. Then the guy I was interviewing with said he was going to get me set up with somebody else. 15 minutes later, a different guy came back with my application (guess they found it). He asked me the same questions the first guy asked me. He started interviewing me for a server which is not what my first interview was for. In the end, he said he couldn't offer me a job and that he has other interviews. I think I might still have a chance to get it (if i understood him correctly; he wasn't very clear), but I don't want it anymore because of how different my interview experiences were. All in all, the first interview was great. It was relaxed and easy. The second interview was a disaster. I was getting anxious because of the time they made me wait. I was no longer nervous about the interview; instead I was getting a little angry that they were unorganized and seemed to know nothing about my first interview (which they had no idea I had). I don't think I tried very hard on the questions the second guy asked me because I was annoyed at how hectic this interview was; plus I was already on the fence about quitting my current job for BJ's. It's my fault I didn't get it, but I still would have liked to have been interviewed for the same job both times.
