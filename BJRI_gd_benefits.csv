5.0,"Oct 23, 2017","Former  Key  in Houston, Texas"," Free food, great health and dental benefits"
3.0,"Dec 13, 2017","Former  Host  in Addison, Texas", I worked full-time hours at one point but had a PT schedule so I did not qualify for benefits since I technically was not a FT employee.
1.0,"Dec 12, 2017","Former  Hostess  in Oviedo, Florida"," There wasn't many other than discounted food. 50% off for tip-based shifts, 100% for non-tip shifts, 25% when dining in,"
1.0,"Dec 09, 2017","Former  Food Server  in Woodland, California"," The ad said they needed full time staff and have an extensive benefits package, but for each job I was qualified for that they were also advertising for, there were ZERO full time positions and each person hired with me also only got part time work."
1.0,"Oct 14, 2017","Former  Employee  in Round Rock, Texas"," The only good thing was the employee meal, But that is only time permitted.... I did work double shifts and not given a 30 min break"
5.0,"Aug 30, 2017","Former  Takeout, Food Runner, Server  in San Bruno, California", The GM was AMAZING. He actually cares about all of his staff from hosts to SA's to Bartenders. Getting half off of food everyday saved me a lot of money.
3.0,"Aug 08, 2017","Current  Employee  in Fort Worth, Texas", You have to work an entire 6 months before you are eligible for benefits.
3.0,"May 14, 2017","Current  Dishwasher/Prep Cook  in Fremont, California", 30 day probation before person gets benefits
4.0,"Apr 08, 2017","Former  Employee  in Huntington Beach, California", Provider network was great and was able to select great physicians
1.0,"Feb 02, 2017","Former  Server/Bartender  in Katy, Texas", Expensive and deductible didn't cover anything
4.0,"Nov 30, 2016","Former  Host/Hostess  in Phoenix, Arizona", Free food when you work and are a non tipped employee. Get to choose from a decent list of options.
1.0,"Jan 24, 2017","Former  Server/Bartender  in Cupertino, California"," Benefits package is a joke. You can only qualify if you work an average of 35 hours per week during a quarter. As well a you must maintain that average afterwards. Therefore if you take a vacation for a week, your average will dropped and you will be dropped off of coverage. This happened to me. That pretty much prevents someone who needs that health coverage to ever take a vacation."
2.0,"Dec 09, 2016","Former  Employee  in Cedar Park, Texas"," The benefits package is nonexistent to most employees....they are ""allotted"" only so many full time positions at each restaurant and most of them are BOH staff. FOH staff very rarely get full time hours and then benefits don't kick in until you've worked full time hours for 6 or 9 months."
4.0,"Nov 15, 2016","Former  Restaurant Manager  in Irvine, California"," Benefits package was substantial and at the better end of most corporate restaurants. The offer a full range of benefits including paid vacation, health, dental, vision, 401k, etc..."
2.0,"Nov 11, 2016","Former  Server  in Temple, Texas", You can kiss time off good-bye. I don't know of any benefits due to the fact that they wont let anyone work more than 40 hours in a week.
3.0,"Oct 20, 2016","Current  Employee  in Norman, Oklahoma"," There isn't much that is offered, since it is a restaurant. You are permitted to ask off, you just have to get your shift covered. There is an easy to use app, HotSchedules, that makes all of that easy. They are pretty good about letting you off work if you're really sick or an emergency happens."
1.0,"Oct 25, 2016","Current  Host Desk Coordinator  in Roseville, California", free meal from limited menu if you work a minimum of 2 hours per shift for non-gratuity employees. Gratuity employees pay 50%
1.0,"Oct 21, 2016","Former  Employee  in Lewisville, Texas", Wasn't a benefits package while I was there.
4.0,"Sep 09, 2016","Former  Manager  in San Antonio, Texas", Vacation time hard to schedule due to so many blackout periods.
3.0,"Sep 08, 2016","Former  Employee  in Sacramento, California", If you are given stocks you are taxed very heavily on them. The medical insurance varies by state and was affected poorly by Obamacare. The free meals are wonderful and can be used at every location.
5.0,"Aug 13, 2016","Former  Server  in College Station, Texas", You're presented with the opportunities as soon as you're hired. To get paid time off you have to work for at least a year. Very lenient with time off before then though.
3.0,"Jul 28, 2016","Current  Food Server  in Roseville, California", Most team members don't get enough hours to receive benefits.
3.0,"Jul 15, 2016","Former  Server  in Redmond, Washington State", No benefits besides flexible scheduling and a 50% discount. Time off was easily arranged.
3.0,"Jun 28, 2016","Former  Server  in Lexington-Fayette, Kentucky"," You are considered part time for the first six months of employment. As so, I was never aware of any benefits the company offered. During working hours, I was able to get half off of food."
3.0,"Jun 16, 2016","Former  Dishwasher  in Santa Rosa, California"," Full-time employment means benefits, which means that full-time staff had their hours cut during my year of employment."
2.0,"May 26, 2016","Former  Server  in Folsom, California", There is no benefits package because no is full time.
3.0,"Apr 26, 2016","Former  Service Assistant  in Tampa, Florida", there was no benefits package for working here. I was part-time so nothing was available to me
3.0,"Mar 04, 2016","Current  Food Server  in Moreno Valley, California"," The best part is the offer everything. 401k, health insurance, life insurance, and vacation. The worst part is they keep making it harder to get these benefits. I worked there 10 years and now you only get 3.4 hours if you work 35 hours a pay period. It use to be 30 hours and it use to 4.9 hours. To get health you must have 34+ hours it use to be 30. They keep changing it so pretty much unless you're a cook you'll never see any of these benefits."
4.0,"Feb 14, 2016","Former  Server  in Escondido, California"," Employee discount meal program, adequate health insurance although its costly"
1.0,"Feb 03, 2016","Former  Server  in College Station, Texas"," I did not receive benefits because I was not there full time. But, they do offer insurance to full time employees and benefits to managers."
5.0,"Dec 29, 2015","Current  Employee  in Lancaster, Pennsylvania"," Vacation, 401k match, health plans."
2.0,"Jan 30, 2016","Current  Host/Hostess  in Anaheim, California", You can only get one free meal a shift and you cant get 2 if you work a double
2.0,"Jan 23, 2016","Former  Supervisor/Bartender/Server  in Austin, Texas"," Well, to be eligible for benefits you have to be considered a full time employee. As a server you are not allowed to work full time hours. They track your hours and when you are approaching the threshold for full time eligibility, you are either not allowed to work or they will call you off for your shift saying something like, its a slow day or we are overstaffed so take the night off. Luckily I was a supervisor and a cook as well so I was able to get the hours I needed."
4.0,"Dec 10, 2015","Current  Employee  in Fort Worth, Texas", If you're a non tipped worker you get free food after your shift. If you're a tipped worker you get 50% off food unless you work a double
4.0,"Nov 23, 2015","Former  Director of Operations  in Jacksonville, Florida", Health insurance offered to employees that work over 30 hours.
3.0,"Dec 06, 2015","Current  Food Server  in Irvine, California"," flexible schedule, most employees are part time"
2.0,"Nov 24, 2015","Former  Service Assistant  in Roseville, California", You got an employee discount and that was pretty much it unless you were management or had worked there for 4+ years. Not a great deal.
4.0,"Oct 29, 2015","Former  Server  in Irvine, California"," Half off food, Free food when we roll out something new, and 25% of when you come into the restaurant on a day you didnt work"
3.0,"Nov 05, 2015","Former  Server/Bartender  in Cupertino, California"," Could request time off ahead of time using hot schedules, able to go to company training meetings, % off of food."

5.0,"Sep 30, 2015","Former  Host  in Allen, Texas"," I was a part time employee, so I personally don't know about the benefits packages and things like that."

3.0,"Sep 15, 2015","Current  Employee  in Los Angeles, California", They work around your schedule.
3.0,"Sep 07, 2015","Current  Server/Bartender  in Redmond, Washington State", It is fairly easy to get time off and most of the time the company is willing to work around your schedule.
3.0,"Sep 07, 2015","Current  Hostess  in Temple, Texas", They genuinely try to give you the time off you need.
2.0,"Aug 17, 2015","Former  Hostess  in Webster, Texas"," No health insurance, no paid time off, no sick leave, no 401k, no stock options"
3.0,"Aug 11, 2015","Current  Server  in Katy, Texas", Only full-time (30 hours) gets access to health care and they won't allow most servers enough hours to qualify because of the new health plan. Servers who qualify can test to get a 'green apron' which offers a $150 one-time bonus and $50 quarterly.
2.0,"Aug 10, 2015","Former  Employee  in Oxnard, California"," Good discount on meals when you worked, very tempting to spend all your money on their food. Also included a drink."
3.0,"Aug 02, 2015","Current  Employee  in Tampa, Florida", BJ's has partial matching for up to 6% of your salaryt on 401K. Medical is pretty good at the manager level
2.0,"Aug 01, 2015","Former  Employee  in Columbus, Ohio", Not available at the time of employment
4.0,"Mar 11, 2015","Current  Operations  in Huntington Beach, California"," Great health insurance, 401k, dental and vision."
3.0,"Jul 17, 2015","Current  Employee  in Denver, Colorado"," It's great to have a 401k offered to even low level employees. They matched 3% for a limited time. The health care they offered before the mandate of the new legislation was much better. I guess having it available means they personally want to spend less money so the coverage is not so great now. For instance, I went to the hospital a few months ago...$6000 in med bills yet only about $500 was covered and I've basically met my deductible for the year with that since the deductible is $5500 I believe. Same thing with glasses...it covered my eye exam and abut $50 of the rest so I still ended up footing about $400 even with basic cheap frames. The health care isn't worth the price. Free meal for hourly non tipped team members and 50% off for tipped, when at work. When coming in off the clock 25% for you and your guests."
3.0,"Jul 01, 2015","Former  Restaurant Manager  in Waco, Texas"," 401K, matching savings plan and paid vacation with time accrued. Pretty good set up for Benefits package for self, spouse can be expensive to add in. Family is a little more than what it cost to add just a spouse."
2.0,"Jun 19, 2015","Current  Server  in Houston, Texas"," There is non lol, so there is no possibility oIf getting a benefits package at BJ's unless maybe your a cook who works full time. If you are a server. Forget About It"
1.0,"Jun 08, 2015","Former  Server  in Laurel, Maryland"," You had to work 40 hours a week, which the management had individual favorites whom they would always schedule more and give them better hours and sections so it was like a cut throat war with fellow employees trying to fight for shifts."
3.0,"Apr 22, 2015","Former  Senior Manager  in San Mateo, California", the worst thing is that a lot of the time we are short managers and its really hard to plan your vacations when you plan on taking one because there wont be enough coverage. Plus the vacation hours maxed out if you reach a certain amount and you start to lose them if you do not use them.
1.0,"May 04, 2015","Former  Server  in Houston, Texas"," It's essentially non-existent, because you have to consistently work 35-40 hours a week for three months straight, and they don't let you do that for scheduling purposes."
2.0,"Apr 03, 2015","Former  Employee  in Los Angeles, California", benefits package at BJ's Restaurants was very basic. Did not have flex account cards available through the insurbnace carrier.
2.0,"Mar 17, 2015","Current  Server Assistant  in Katy, Texas"," Double pay during your yearly anniversary, two checks."
4.0,"Jan 27, 2015","Current  Senior Manager  in Dallas, Texas"," Great Benefits package, helped me immensely"
5.0,"Nov 05, 2014","Former  Employee  in Dallas, Texas", Company paid a very high percentage. My spouse and I were covered for $100 a paycheck(medical/dental/vision).
3.0,"Dec 10, 2014","Current  Bj's Brewhouse Server  in Round Rock, Texas"," Health insurance really sucks... covers $10,000 a year..."
3.0,"Sep 22, 2014","Former  Food Server  in Norman, Oklahoma"," Servers got half-off of even the higher quality, most expensive food items."
4.0,"Sep 02, 2014","Current  Employee  in Fort Collins, Colorado", Good discounts. Free meals for kitchen staff.
