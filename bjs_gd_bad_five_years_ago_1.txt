Not many cons, perhaps the only bad thing I've noticed is when they make bad hires that dilute the positive energy of the restaurant Not the best pay p The management doesn't respect the needs and wants of their employees and scheduling is sometimes posted just a day or two before you may have to work. None great place to work Not good if you're looking to make a lot of money long term but enough to get by as a college student some people are not fun to server, the same income is not always the same Servers to not receive benefit share. Huge menu which can be frustrating to try to learn Too based on numbers of secret shoppers no matter what the circumstances, lots of turnover Development is non existent, work life balance strained, don't pay their employees (hourly) competitively vs the industry and benefits for non management are horrid When it's in a slow season you get close to no hours. Because this mystery shopper was having a bad day and what I was trained to do was actually wrong, I am now a single mom without a job to support my daughter and have no idea what I am going to do to pay for daycare and rent in a couple of weeks. Because of the number of extra trips we have to make at this restaurant, consolidation is key, so when I stack plates from my belly button to my nose to haul them back to dish, I end up with spots of food all over me. And there's no getting rid of it until I get home.
